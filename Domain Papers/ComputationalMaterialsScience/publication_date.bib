ABSTRACT = {Coupled with the results of a 2D heat transfer model, a 3D electromagnetic stirring round billet model is developed, which is considered for the difference in the conductivity of solidified shell and molten steel. The electromagnetic field distribution features of the billet and the effect of round billet sizes on the electromagnetic field are investigated. It is found that as the solidified shell conductivity of the Φ600 mm round billet increases from 7.14 × 105 S·m−1 to 1.0 × 106 S·m−1, the magnetic induction intensity decreases and the maximum value of electromagnetic force drops from 7976.26 N·m−3 to 5745.32 N·m−3. The magnetic induction intensity on the center axis of the stirrer rarely changes in the range of Φ100–Φ200 mm. With the increase in the round billet from Φ300 mm to Φ600 mm, the magnetic induction intensity and the electromagnetic force on the center axis of the stirrer decrease slowly and then significantly. In the range of 2–8 Hz, as the current strength reaches its maximum, the electromagnetic force can be increased by increasing the current frequency for round billets of Φ100–Φ500 mm, while there is an optimal current frequency for round billets larger than Φ600 mm.},

ABSTRACT = {In order to study the effect of TiB2 particles on the mechanical properties of TiB2/6061Al composites, a series of 3D TiB2/6061Al representative volume elements (RVEs) were established based on SEM photos. This model took into account the ductile damage of the matrix and the traction separation behavior of the interface, and the linear damage evolution law was introduced to characterize stiffness degradation in the matrix elements. Mixed boundary conditions were used in the RVE tensile experiments, and the accuracy of the predicted result was verified by the agreement of the experimental stress-strain curve. The results showed that the addition of TiB2 particles can effectively promote the load-bearing capacity of the composite, but elongation is reduced. When the weight fraction of TiB2 increased from 2.5% to 12.5%, the elastic modulus, yield strength, and tensile strength increased by 8%, 10.37%, and 11.55%, respectively, while the elongation decreased by 10%. The clustering rate of the TiB2 particles is also an important factor affecting the toughness of the composites. With an increase in the clustering rate of TiB2 particles from 20% to 80%, the load-bearing capacity of the composites did not improve, and the elongation of the composites was reduced by 8%. Moreover, the high-strain region provides a path for rapid crack propagation, and particle spacing is a crucial factor that affects the stress field.},

ABSTRACT = {Horizontal-axis wind turbines are the most popular wind machines in operation today. These turbines employ aerodynamic blades that may be oriented either upward or downward. HAWTs are the most common non-conventional source of energy generation. These turbine blades fail mostly due to fatigue, as a large centrifugal force acts on them at high rotational speeds. This study aims to increase a turbine’s service life by improving the turbine blades’ fatigue life. Predicting the fatigue life and the design of the turbine blade considers the maximum wind speed range. SolidWorks, a CAD program, is used to create a wind turbine blade utilizing NACA profile S814. The wind turbine blade’s fatigue life is calculated using Morrow’s equation. A turbine blade will eventually wear out due to several forces operating on it. Ansys software is used to analyze these stresses using the finite element method. The fatigue study of wind turbine blades is described in this research paper. To increase a turbine blade’s fatigue life, this research study focuses on design optimization. Based on the foregoing characteristics, an improved turbine blade design with a longer fatigue life than the original one is intended in this study. The primary fatigue parameters are the length of a chord twist angle and blade length. The experimental data computed with the aid of a fatigue testing machine are also used to validate the numerical results, and it is found that they are very similar to one another. By creating the most effective turbine blades with the longest fatigue life, this research study can be developed further. The most effective turbine blades with the longest fatigue life can be designed to further this research investigation.},

ABSTRACT = {The design of continuous thickeners and clarifiers is commonly based on the solid flux theory. Batch sedimentation experiments conducted with solid concentrations still provide useful information for their application. The construction of models for the velocity of settling allows the estimation of the flux of solids throughout time, which can, in turn, be used to find the area of the units required to achieve a given solid concentration in the clarified stream. This paper addresses the numerical treatment of data obtained from batch sedimentation experiments of calcium carbonate particles. We propose a systematic framework to fit a model that is capable of representing the process features that involve (i) the numerical differentiation of data to generate initial estimates for the instantaneous velocity of settling; (ii) the integration of a differential equation to fit the model for the velocity of settling; and (iii) the assessment of the quality of the fit using common statistical indicators. The model used for demonstration has a theoretical basis combined with an empirical component to account for the effect of the particle concentrations and their state of aggregation. The values of the numerical parameters obtained are related to the characteristic dimensions of the aggregates and their mass-length fractal dimensions.},

ABSTRACT = {Equation-Informed Neural Networks (EINNs) are developed as an efficient method for extracting the coefficients of constitutive equations. Subsequently, numerical Bayesian Inference (BI) iterations were applied to estimate the distribution of these coefficients, thereby further refining them. We could generate coefficients optimally aligned with the targeted application scenario by carefully adjusting pre-processing mapping parameters and identifying dataset preferences. Leveraging graphical representation techniques, the EINNs formulation is implemented in temperature- and strain-rate-dependent hyperbolic Garofalo, Anand, and Chaboche constitutive models to extract the corresponding coefficients for lead-free SAC305 solder material. The performance of the EINNs-based extracted coefficients, obtained from experimental results of SAC305 solder material, is comparable to existing studies. The methodology offers the dual advantage of providing the coefficients’ value and distribution against the training dataset.},

ABSTRACT = {The study aimed to evaluate the tensile strength of additively manufactured (AMed) IN 625 using sub-sized test pieces and compare them to standard specimens. Cylindrical round coupons of varying diameters were manufactured along the Z-axis using the laser powder bed fusion technique and subjected to heat treatment. The simulation of the alloy solidification predicted the formation of several intermetallics and carbides under equilibrium conditions (slow cooling), apart from the γ phase (FCC). Sub-sized tensile specimens with different gauge diameters were machined from the coupons and tensile tested at ambient temperature. The results showed that sub-sized specimens exhibited lower tensile and yield strengths compared to standard specimens, but still higher than the minimum requirements of the relevant ASTM standard for AMed IN 625. The lower strength was attributed to the “size effect” of the test specimens. Fracture surfaces of the sub-sized test specimens exhibit a mixed character, combining cleavage and microvoid coalescence, with improved ductility compared to standard test pieces. The study highlights the importance of adapting characterization methods to the particularities of manufactured parts, including reduced thicknesses that make sampling standard-size specimens impractical. It concludes that sub-sized specimens are valuable for quality control and verifying compliance with requirements of AMed IN 625 tensile properties.},

ABSTRACT = {The mechanisms of the strain rate dependence of closed-cell PVC foams under shock were numerically studied based on a cell-based model combined with the Coupled Eulerian–Lagrangian (CEL) method in this paper. The strain rate effect of the base material and the entrapped gas effect were focused. The results show that the strain rate effect of the base material has a significant influence on the stress magnitude in the regions before and after the shock front, and the entrapped gas mainly affects the velocity field. Both the strain rate effect of the base material and the entrapped gas have a notable influence on the strain distribution. Taking PVC foam with a relative density of 0.07 as an example, the strain rate effect of the base material will increase the impact stress by 45% and reduce the impact strain by 0.04. The entrapped gas will reduce the impact strain by 0.18, and its effect on the impact stress can be ignored. Finally, two constitutive laws considering the strain rate effect and entrapped gas effect were proposed and compared for the PVC foam under shock with one based on the Hugoniot relationship and the other based on the D-RPH model.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper introduces a novel method for estimating the cyclic stress–strain curves of steels based on their monotonic properties and plastic strain amplitudes, utilizing artificial neural networks (ANNs). ANNs were trained on a substantial number of experimental data for steels, collected from relevant literature, and divided into subgroups according to alloying elements content (unalloyed, low-alloy, and high-alloy steels). Only monotonic properties that were proven to be relevant for the estimation of points on the stress–strain curve were used. The performance of the developed ANNs was assessed using an independent set of data, and the results were compared to experimental values, values obtained by existing empirical estimation methods, and by previously developed ANNs. The results showed that the new approach which combines relevant monotonic properties and plastic strain amplitudes as inputs to ANNs for cyclic stress–strain curve estimation is better than the previously used approach where ANNs estimate the parameters of the Ramberg–Osgood material model separately. This shows that a more favorable approach to the estimation of cyclic stress–strain behavior would be to directly estimate corresponding material curves using monotonic properties. Additionally, this may also reduce inaccuracies resulting from simplified representations of the actual material behavior inherent in the material model.},

ABSTRACT = {Physics-Informed neural networks (PINNs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by incorporating the governing PDEs into the network’s loss function during optimization. PINNs have been successfully applied to diverse inverse and forward problems. This study investigates the feasibility of using PINNs for material data identification in an induction hardening test rig. By utilizing temperature sensor data and imposing the heat equation with initial and boundary conditions, thermo-physical material properties, such as specific heat, thermal conductivity, and the heat convection coefficient, were estimated. To validate the effectiveness of the PINNs in material data estimation, benchmark data generated by a finite element model (FEM) of an air-cooled cylindrical sample were used. The accurate identification of the material data using only a limited number of virtual temperature sensor data points was demonstrated. The influence of the sensor positions and measurement noise on the uncertainty of the estimated parameters was examined. The study confirms the robustness and accuracy of this approach in the presence of measurement noise, albeit with lower efficiency, thereby requiring more time to converge. Lastly, the applicability of the presented approach to real measurement data obtained from an air-cooled cylindrical sample heated in an induction heating test rig was discussed. This research contributes to the accurate offline estimation of material data and has implications for optimizing induction heat treatments.},

ABSTRACT = {Marine flow-passing components are susceptible to cavitation erosion (CE), and researchers have worked to find ways to reduce its effects. Laser Shock Peening (LSP), a material strengthening method, has been widely used in aerospace and other cutting-edge fields. In recent years, LSP has been used in cavitation resistance research. However, the current LSP research does not realize a comprehensive predictive assessment of the material’s CE resistance. This paper uses m stresses to develop a comprehensive set of strengthening effect prediction models from LSP to CE using finite element analysis (FEA). Results show that the LSP-1 sample (4 mm spot, 10 J energy) introduced a compressive residual stress value of 37.4 MPa, better than that of 16.6 MPa with the LSP-2 sample (6 mm spot, 10 J energy), which is generally consistent with the experimental findings; the model predicts a 16.35% improvement in the resistance of LSP-1 sample to water jet damage, which is comparable to the experimental result of 14.02%; additionally, interactions between micro-jets do not predominate the cavitation erosion process and the final CE effect of the material is mainly due to the accumulation of jet-material interaction.},

ABSTRACT = {Corrosion of steel reinforcements in concrete constructions is a worldwide problem. To assess the degradation of rebars in reinforced concrete, an accurate description of electric current, potential and concentrations of various species present in the concrete matrix is necessary. Although the concrete matrix is a heterogeneous porous material with intricate microstructure, mass transport has been treated in a homogeneous material so far, modifying bulk transport coefficients by additional factors (porosity, constrictivity, tortuosity), which led to so-called effective coefficients (e.g., diffusivity). This study presents an approach where the real 3D microstructure of concrete is obtained from high-resolution X-ray computed tomography (XCT), processed to generate a mesh for finite element method (FEM) computations, and finally combined with a multi-species system of transport and electric potential equations. This methodology allows for a more realistic description of ion movements and reactions in the bulk concrete and on the rebar surface and, consequently, a better evaluation of anodic and cathodic currents, ultimately responsible for the loss of reinforcement mass and its location. The results of this study are compared with a state-of-the-art model and numerical calculations for 2D and 3D geometries.},

ABSTRACT = {Previous studies have shown that coal-based solid waste can be utilized in combination with cement, silica fume, and other modified materials to create a cemented backfill material. However, traditional cemented backfill materials have poor mechanical properties, which may induce the emergence of mining pressure and trigger dynamic disaster under complex mining conditions. In this study, the nanocomposite fiber was used to modify the traditional cemented backfill materials and a new cemented backfill material was developed using coal-based solid waste, nanocomposite fiber and other materials. Specifically, coal gangue, fly ash, cement, and glass fibers were used as the basic materials, different mass fractions of nano-SiO2 were used to prepare cemented backfill materials, and the mechanical enhancement effect of the compressive strength, tensile strength, and shear strength of the modified materials was analyzed. The results show that when the nano-SiO2 dosage is 1%, the optimal compressive strength of the specimens at the curing age of 7 d can be obtained compared with cemented materials without nano-SiO2, and the compressive strength of the modified specimens raises by 84%; when the nano-SiO2 dosage is 1%, the optimal tensile strength and shear strengths of the modified specimens can be obtained at the curing age of 28 d, increasing by 82% and 142%. The results reveal that nanocomposite fibers can be used as additives to change the mechanical properties of cemented backfill materials made using coal-based solid waste. This study provides a reference for the disposal of coal-based solid waste and the enhancement of the mechanical properties of cemented backfill materials.},

ABSTRACT = {Material properties, geometrical dimensions, and environmental conditions can greatly influence the characteristics of bistable composite laminates. In the current work, to understand how each input feature contributes to the curvatures of the stable equilibrium shapes of bistable laminates and the snap-through force to change these configurations, the correlation between these inputs and outputs is studied using a novel explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) approach called SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). SHAP is employed to explain the contribution and importance of the features influencing the curvatures and the snap-through force since XAI models change the data into a form that is more convenient for users to understand and interpret. The principle of minimum energy and the Rayleigh–Ritz method is applied to obtain the responses of the bistable laminates used as the input datasets in SHAP. SHAP effectively evaluates the importance of the input variables to the parameters. The results show that the transverse thermal expansion coefficient and moisture variation have the most impact on the model’s output for the transverse curvatures and snap-through force. The eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Finite Element (FM) methods are also employed to identify the feature importance and validate the theoretical approach, respectively.},

ABSTRACT = {Introducing a coating shell between the filler and matrix is an effective way to reduce the dielectric loss of the particle/matrix dielectric composites. It found that besides the improvement in interface compatibility, there may be some other effects of the coating shell, such as the elimination of the dielectric mismatch. However, the specific mechanism is still unclear due to the absence of an effective model for the quantitative analysis of the relationship between core–shell structure and dielectric loss, hindering the progress of the dielectric composite design. Here, a phase-field model for simulating high-frequency, alternating-field polarization is employed to study the relationship between high-frequency polarization loss and the coating shell in the silicon dioxide coating boron nitride polytetrafluoroethylene-based (BN@SiO2/PTFE) composite. The results show that the dielectric mismatch makes the high-frequency polarization loss spatially localized and periodically time-variant. The reduction of polarization loss depends on the polarization loss of SiO2. To reduce the high-frequency dielectric loss of the composite, the coating shell should not only eliminate the dielectric mismatch, but its dielectric loss must also be lower than that of the core filler. Furthermore, the model provided in this work has the potential to extend the quantitative calculation of non-intrinsic polarization loss and conduction loss.},

ABSTRACT = {Numerical simulation of impact and shock-wave interactions of deformable solids is an urgent problem. The key to the adequacy and accuracy of simulation is the material model that links the yield strength with accumulated plastic strain, strain rate, and temperature. A material model often used in engineering applications is the empirical Johnson–Cook (JC) model. However, an increase in the impact velocity complicates the choice of the model constants to reach agreement between numerical and experimental data. This paper presents a method for the selection of the JC model constants using an optimization algorithm based on the Nesterov gradient-descent method. A solution quality function is proposed to estimate the deviation of calculations from experimental data and to determine the optimum JC model parameters. Numerical calculations of the Taylor rod-on-anvil impact test were performed for cylindrical copper specimens. The numerical simulation performed with the optimized JC model parameters was in good agreement with the experimental data received by the authors of this paper and with the literature data. The accuracy of simulation depends on the experimental data used. For all considered experiments, the calculation accuracy (solution quality) increased by 10%. This method, developed for selecting optimized material model constants, may be useful for other models, regardless of the numerical code used for high-velocity impact simulations.},

ABSTRACT = {The process of concrete cracking is a common problem because the first micro-cracks due to the loss of moisture may appear even before the concrete is loaded. The application of fracture mechanics allows for a better understanding of this problem. Steel-fiber-reinforced concrete (SFRC) samples with a notch were subjected to a three-point bending test, and the results for crack energy were used to analyze the concrete’s material properties. In this paper, an experimental and numerical analysis of SFRC with rapid changes in the force (F) crack mouth opening displacement (CMOD) curve (F-CMOD) is presented. In order to obtain the relevant F-CMOD diagrams, three-point bending tests were carried out with non-standard samples with a thickness equal to one-third of the width of standard samples. For analysis purposes, crimped steel fibers were adopted. A probabilistic analysis of the most important parameters describing the material in question, such as peak strength, post-cracking strength, crack mouth opening displacement (CMOD), fracture energy, and the post-cracking deformation modulus, was conducted. The tests and the analysis of their results show that the quasi-static numerical method can be applied to obtain suitable results. However, significant dynamic effects during experiments that influence the F-CMOD curves are hard to reflect well in numerical calculations.},

ABSTRACT = {Corrosion product films (CPFs) have significant effects on hydrogen permeation and the corrosion process at the crack tip. This paper established a two-dimensional calculation model to simulate the formation of CPFs at the crack tip and its effects on the crack tip stress status and hydrogen diffusion. The CPFs were simplified as a single-layer structure composed of Fe2O3, the effective CPFs boundary was modeled by the diffusion of oxygen, and the CPF-induced stress was modeled by hygroscopic expansion. The simulation was conducted with two stages; the first stage was to simulate the formation of CPFs formation and its effects on the crack tip stress status, while the second stage focused on the hydrogen diffusion with and without CPF formation under different external tensile loads. The results indicate that the highest compressive stress induced by the formation of CPFs is located at 50~60° of the crack contour and dramatically weakens the crack tip tensile stress at low-stress status. The CPFs can inhibit the hydrogen permeation into the crack tip, and the hydrostatic pressure effects on the redistribution of the permeated hydrogen are significant under larger external load conditions.},

ABSTRACT = {Extrusion welding of AlZnMg alloys encounters great technological difficulties in practice associated with high shaping forces and the low quality of longitudinal welds. Three different chemical compositions of 7021 aluminum alloy, differing in terms of Zn and Mg contents, were used in the first stage of the research. The laboratory device modelling the behavior of metal in welding chambers of the porthole die was applied to examine the ability of 7021 alloys to produce high-quality joints. The weldability tests were carried out for different welding temperatures—400, 450 and 500 °C—and for a fixed welding pressure of 300 MPa. The microstructural effects in pressure-welds were evaluated with the use of OM and SEM/EDS. The temperature–pressure parameters in the welding chambers were analyzed by using the FEM method for original porthole dies while extruding tubes with dimensions of Ø50 × 2 mm. Finally, the industrial extrusion trials were performed with examination of the structure and strength of the seam welds. It was found that it is possible to produce high-quality high-strength welds in tubes extruded from AlZnMg alloys in industrial conditions (the strength of welds in the range of 96–101% of the strength of the basic non-welded material) through properly matched alloy chemical composition of the alloy, construction of the porthole dies and temperature–speed conditions of deformation.},

ABSTRACT = {Electrode induction melting gas atomization (EIGA) technology is a commonly used and effective method for producing spherical metal powders in additive manufacturing. In this paper, we aim to describe the atomization and fragmentation of liquid sheets from a typical swirl nozzle and highlight the primary breakup of titanium alloy powder production. We developed a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approach to simulate the primary disintegration process of the molten metal using the volume of fluid (VOF) method coupled with the large eddy simulation turbulence model (LES). Our numerical results show that high-speed spraying creates supersonic airflow in the atomization chamber. Recirculation is the main area where primary atomization occurs. The formation of the recirculation zone is the direct driving force that allows atomization to proceed, which will increase turbulence intensity and achieve higher atomization efficiency. VOF-LES simulation can capture some qualitative results such as conical melt-sheet shape, wave formation, ligament formation, and perforation formation. The primary droplet size mainly ranges between 200 and 800 μm. Finally, with increasing gas pressure, the particle size of the atomized powder gradually decreases, and the particle size distribution becomes narrower.},

ABSTRACT = {The purpose of the study was to analyze the influence of the quality class and the orthotropy of wood upon the sound absorption coefficient, the reflection and the impedance ratio of two species widely used for stringed musical instruments, namely spruce (Picea abies L. Karst) and maple (Acer pseudoplatanus L.). An impedance tube for the frequency range 100–6400 Hz was used in these experimental determinations. Knowing the influence of porosity and tortuosity on the acoustic absorption, these properties were also determined, as well as the sound reduction coefficient and the maximum values of the acoustic absorption coefficients in relation to frequency. The main results highlighted the differences between the anatomical quality class of the wood within each species, but also concerning the sound direction relative to the three main sections of wood, as an orthotropic material. The article highlights the acoustic performance parameters related to the frequency of the wooden material and its relationship to density, porosity and quality class. The results represent useful information for musical instruments manufacturers and more.},

ABSTRACT = {This article aims to investigate the feasibility of using discrete element software EDEM 2022.0 to simulate the trajectory of artificial marble patterns in a dual horizontal shaft mixer. Research was conducted on the mixing uniformity of particles in the mixing chamber, and the optimal speed range for particle mixing was established. By simulating the trajectory of pigment particles, the trajectories of the particles at different positions of the stirring paddle were obtained, and the trajectories were compared with the measured results. In the study of uniform particle mixing, the Lacey index at different speeds was compared, and the optimal speed range was established between 40 RPM and 60 RPM. Based on this, the particle trajectory simulation found that the motion trajectories of particles at different positions of the stirring paddle varied significantly. The particles in the stirring paddle rod exhibit a gradual trend, in which they gradually decrease as they approach the head of the stirring paddle. Finally, the feasibility of this method was established by comparing the simulated and actual patterns through proportional replication of the mixing process, and it was discovered that the two were similar.},

ABSTRACT = {A theoretical approach based on Periodic Boundary Conditions (PBC) and a Linear Combination of Atomic Orbitals (LCAO) in the framework of the density functional theory (DFT) is used to investigate the molecular mechanism that rules the piezoelectric behavior of poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) polymer in the crystalline β-phase. We present several computational tests highlighting the peculiar electrostatic potential energy landscape the polymer chains feel when they change their orientation by a rigid rotation in the lattice cell. We demonstrate that a rotation of the permanent dipole through chain rotation has a rather low energy cost and leads to a lattice relaxation. This justifies the macroscopic strain observed when the material is subjected to an electric field. Moreover, we investigate the effect on the molecular geometry of the expansion of the lattice parameters in the (a, b) plane, proving that the rotation of the dipole can take place spontaneously under mechanical deformation. By band deconvolution of the IR and Raman spectra of a PVDF film with a high content of β-phase, we provide the experimental phonon wavenumbers and relative band intensities, which we compare against the predictions from DFT calculations. This analysis shows the reliability of the LCAO approach, as implemented in the CRYSTAL software, for calculating the vibrational spectra. Finally, we investigate how the IR/Raman spectra evolve as a function of inter-chain distance, moving towards the isolated chain limit and to the limit of a single crystal slab. The results show the relevance of the inter-molecular interactions on the vibrational dynamics and on the electro-optical features ruling the intensity pattern of the vibrational spectra.},

ABSTRACT = {The tool structure is an important factor affecting the damage of CFRP/Ti stacks machining. However, the impact of tool structure on the formation process of stacks hole damage cannot be fully revealed through experimental methods alone. In contrast, finite element simulation can effectively overcome the limitations of experiments. In this study, a numerical simulation model is established to investigate the relationship between step drill structure and formation process of CFRP/Ti stacks hole damage. Based on this, the research discusses the effect of step drill structure on the burr height of Ti layer, delamination of CFRP, aperture deviation, defects in hole surface. The results show that when the stacking sequence is CFRP to Ti, the burr height of Ti at hole exit decreases first and then increases with the rising of the ratio of primary drill bit diameter to secondary drill bit diameter (kd). When kd is 0.6, the burr height of Ti at hole exit is the lower. As kd increasing from 0.4 to 1.0, delamination factor of CFRP increases by 2.57%, which are affected little by the step drill structure due to the support of Ti. Besides, the aperture size deviation decreases first then increases with the rising of kd, and the minimum aperture size deviation is 2.09 μm when kd is 0.6. In addition, as kd is 0.6, the hole wall defect is fewer. In conclusion, step drill with kd of 0.6 is suitable for drilling of CFRP/Ti stacks.},

ABSTRACT = {Fibre-reinforced concrete (FRC) has been used for decades in certain applications in the construction industry, such as tunnel linings and precast elements, but has experienced important progress in recent times, boosted by the inclusion of guidelines for its use in some national and international standards. Traditional steel fibres have been studied in depth and their performance is well-known, although in recent years new materials have been proposed as possible alternatives. Polyolefin macro-fibres, for instance, have been proven to enhance the mechanical properties of concrete and the parameters that define their behaviour (fibre length, fibre proportion or casting method, for instance) have been identified. These fibres overcome certain traditional problems related to steel fibres, such as corrosion or their interaction with magnetic fields, which can limit the use of steel in some applications. The behaviour of polyolefin fibre-reinforced concrete (PFRC) has been numerically reproduced with success through an embedded cohesive crack formulation that uses a trilinear softening diagram to describe the fracture behaviour of the material. Furthermore, concrete behaves well under high temperatures or fire events, especially when it is compared with other construction materials, but the behaviour of PFRC must be analysed if the use of these fibres is to be extended. To this end, the degradation of PFRC fracture properties has been recently experimentally analysed under a temperature range between 20 °C and 200 °C. As temperature increases, polyolefin fibres modify their mechanical properties and their shape, which reduce their performance as reinforcements of concrete. In this work, those experimental results, which include results of low (3 kg/m3) and high (10 kg/m3) proportion PFRC specimens, are used as reference to study the fracture behaviour of PFRC exposed to high temperatures from a numerical point of view. The experimental load-deflection diagrams are reproduced by modifying the trilinear diagram used in the cohesive model, which helps to understand how the trilinear diagram parameters are affected by high temperature exposure. Finally, some expressions are proposed to adapt the initial trilinear diagram (obtained with specimens not exposed to high temperature) in order to numerically reproduce the fracture behaviour of PFRC affected by high temperature exposure.},

ABSTRACT = {Molecular simulations are currently receiving significant attention for their ability to offer a microscopic perspective that explains macroscopic phenomena. An essential aspect is the accurate characterization of molecular structural parameters and the development of realistic numerical models. This study investigates the surface morphology and elemental distribution of silicon nitride fibers through TEM and EDS, and SEM and EDS analyses. Utilizing a customized molecular dynamics approach, molecular models of amorphous and multi-interface silicon nitride fibers with complex structures were constructed. Tensile simulations were conducted to explore correlations between performance and molecular structural composition. The results demonstrate successful construction of molecular models with amorphous, amorphous–crystalline interface, and mixed crystalline structures. Mechanical property characterization reveal the following findings: (1) The nonuniform and irregular amorphous structure causes stress concentration and crack formation under applied stress. Increased density enhances material strength but leads to higher crack sensitivity. (2) Incorporating a crystalline reinforcement phase without interfacial crosslinking increases free volume and relative tensile strength, improving toughness and reducing crack susceptibility. (3) Crosslinked interfaces effectively enhance load transfer in transitional regions, strengthening the material’s tensile strength, while increased density simultaneously reduces crack propagation.},

ABSTRACT = {It is undeniable that mechanical properties, such as the stiffness or residual strength of fibre-reinforced thermoplastics, are adversely affected by fatigue damage caused by cyclic loading. In order to quantify and predict this damage influence, a calculation approach was developed in the past for the subgroup of short-fibre-reinforced thermoplastics. In order to test and expand the applicability of this approach to the field of long-fibre-reinforced thermoplastics, the decrease in mechanical properties is investigated experimentally in this paper using PP LGF30, propylene reinforced with long glass fibres, as an example. The paper describes both the fatigue behaviour and the residual strength of the material after fatigue damage. A decrease in the residual strength of up to about 35% could be recorded. The paper also presents a modelling approach that predicts the orientation-dependent fatigue strength of the material, and furthermore allows for the calculation of its residual strength as a function of fatigue damage. The novelty of the contribution lies in the continuous modelling of fatigue behaviour for arbitrary oriented samples of long-fibre-reinforced thermoplastics and also in the prediction of its residual strength depending on previously induced fatigue damage.},

ABSTRACT = {While the bulk strontium titanate (STO) crystal characteristics are relatively well known, ultrathin perovskites’ nanostructure, chemical composition, and crystallinity are quite complex and challenging to understand in detail. In our study, the DFT methods were used for modelling the Raman spectra of the STO bulk (space group I4/mcm) and 5–21-layer thin films (layer group p4/mbm) in tetragonal phase with different thicknesses ranging from ~0.8 to 3.9 nm. Our calculations revealed features in the Raman spectra of the films that were absent in the bulk spectra. Out of the seven Raman-active modes associated with bulk STO, the frequencies of five modes (2Eg, A1g, B2g, and B1g) decreased as the film thickness increased, while the low-frequency B2g and higher-frequency Eg modes frequencies increased. The modes in the films exhibited vibrations with different amplitudes in the central or surface parts of the films compared to the bulk, resulting in frequency shifts. Some peaks related to bulk vibrations were too weak (compared to the new modes related to films) to distinguish in the Raman spectra. However, as the film thickness increased, the Raman modes approached the frequencies of the bulk, and their intensities became higher, making them more noticeable in the Raman spectrum. Our results could help to explain inconsistencies in the experimental data for thin STO films, providing insights into the behavior of Raman modes and their relationship with film thickness.},

ABSTRACT = {Titanium alloys have been present for decades as the main components for the production of various orthopedic and dental elements. However, modern times require titanium alloys with a low Young’s modulus, and without the presence of cytotoxic alloying elements. Machine learning was used with aim to analyze biocompatible titanium alloys and predict the composition of Ti alloys with a low Young’s modulus. A database was created using experimental data for alloy composition, Young’s modulus, and mechanical and thermal properties of biocompatible titanium alloys. The Extra Tree Regression model was built to predict the Young’s modulus of titanium alloys. By processing data of 246 alloys, the specific heat was discovered to be the most influential parameter that contributes to the lowering of the Young’s modulus of titanium alloys. Further, the Monte Carlo method was used to predict the composition of future alloys with the desired properties. Simulation results of ten million samples, with predefined conditions for obtaining titanium alloys with a Young’s modulus lower than 70 GPa, show that it is possible to obtain several multicomponent alloys, consisting of five main elements: titanium, zirconium, tin, manganese and niobium.},

ABSTRACT = {In this work, the nearest-neighbor distances and Voronoi cell features of Cu-Ag deposits were analyzed and fitted with Lognormal, Weibull, and Gamma distributions. The nearest-neighbor distance distributions of the samples were compared with those of complete spatially random points, showing spatial inhomogeneity due to the nucleation exclusion effect. The radial distribution function was calculated, showing both influences from the grain size and the nucleation exclusion effect. Voronoi cells were generated based on the shape of the grains. The size, occupancy, and coordination of the Voronoi cells were examined and fitted. The results show that although the Cu-Ag deposits seemed to be governed by the instantaneous nucleation mode, the spatial distribution of the nuclei was more impacted by the nucleation exclusion effect than the Cu-only samples. This behavior is also justified by the grain size distribution generated with Voronoi cell size and occupancy distributions.},

ABSTRACT = {Composites, such as fiber-reinforced plastics, are produced using layering prepregs with varying ply orientations to achieve enhanced mechanical properties. However, this results in intricate residual stresses, which are influenced by the forming process and ply orientation. In this study, three representative microscopic models—featuring discrete fiber and resin—represent unidirectional, cross-ply, and angle-ply laminates. These models underwent simulations under three different cooling histories using the finite element method. The findings suggest that ply orientation does not significantly influence temperature distribution. However, it significantly impacts the von Mises stress in the fiber closest to the interface between two stacked laminae. This differs from the inter-laminar stresses determined with the macroscopic lamination model. Apart from the free edge, which exhibits a complex stress distribution, the von Mises stress within a unit cell displays a recurring pattern. The magnitude of the von Mises stress decreases as the ply orientation angle increases and shifts when a temperature gradient is present throughout the composite’s thickness. This study provides valuable insights into the mechanics of residual stresses at the microscopic level and highlights potential defect areas influenced by these stresses.},

ABSTRACT = {In severe service environments, the presence of high local residual stress, significant organizational gradient, and nonlinear changes in material properties often leads to stress corrosion cracking (SCC) in dissimilar metal welded (DMW) joints. To accurately predict the crack growth rate, researching the initiation and propagation behavior of SCC cracks in DMW joints under residual stress (RS) is one of the most important methods to ensure the safe operation of nuclear power plants. Using the extended finite element method (XFEM), the crack propagation behaviors in DMW joints under different RS states are predicted and compared. The effects of RS, crack location, and initial crack length on crack propagation behavior are investigated. The crack in a DMW joint without RS deflects to the material of low yield strength. High residual stress urges the crack growing direction to deflect toward the material of high yield strength. Young’s modulus has little impact on the crack deflection paths. The distance between the specimen symmetric line and the boundary line has little effect on the crack initiation and propagation within the RS field. A long initial crack is more likely to initiate and propagate than a short crack. To a long crack and the crack that is far from the interface of two materials, the impact of residual stress on the crack propagation path is significant when it is located in a material with high yield strength, while when the initial crack is located in the material with low yield strength, RS has a great influence on the deflection of a short crack growth direction on the condition that the crack is adjacent to the interface.},

ABSTRACT = {This article presents a numerical and experimental investigation into the impact of can wall thickness and the internal varnish layer thickness on the results of an axial load force test. This study also shows the levels of thermal stresses that emerge after the drying of varnish coating, and how they affect the results of the axial load force test. This research involves the development of suitable numerical models and the experimental acquisition of stress–deformation relationships for the both can material, aluminum, and the varnish. The numerical simulation of the axial load force test has been verified through experimental tests, with a resulting difference of 8.9% between the two sets of results. The findings highlight that changes in the can wall thickness have a more pronounced effect on test outcomes compared to variations in the varnish thickness. Specifically, an increase in the can wall thickness from 90 µm to 100 µm results in a substantial 116 N increase in the force required for a can to collapse. Nevertheless, the presence of a 5 µm varnish layer also contributes measurably, increasing the can’s collapse force by 21 N. These results offer valuable practical insights for manufacturers, enabling them to effectively optimize can strength characteristics.},

ABSTRACT = {Understanding the infiltration and solidification processes of liquid 5083Al alloy into Al2O3 three-dimensional reticulated porous ceramic (Al2O3(3D) RPC) is essential for optimizing the microstructure and properties of Al2O3(3D)/5083Al interpenetrating phase composites (IPCs) prepared by low-pressure infiltration process (LPIP). This study employs ProCAST software to simulate the infiltration and solidification processes of liquid 5083Al with pouring velocities (PV) of 0.4 m/s infiltrating into Al2O3(3D) RPC preforms with varying porosities at different pouring temperatures (PT) to prepare Al2O3(3D)/5083Al IPCs using LPIP. The results demonstrate that pore diameter of Al2O3(3D) RPC preforms and PT of liquid 5083Al significantly influence the of the infiltration. Solidification process analysis reveals that the Al2O3(3D) RPC preform with smaller pore diameters allows the lower pouring velocity of 5083Al to solidify faster compared to the preform with larger pore diameters. Al2O3(3D)/5083Al IPCs were prepared successfully from Al2O3(3D) RPC porosity of 15 PPI with liquid 5083Al at PV 0.4 m/s and PT 800 °C using LPIP, resulting in nearly fully dense composites, where both Al2O3(3D) RPCs and 5083Al interpenetrate throughout the microstructure. The infiltration and solidification defects were reduced under air pressure of 0.3 MPa (corresponding to PV of 0.4 m/s) during LPIP. Finite volume method simulations are in good agreement with experimental data, validating the suitability of the simplified model for Al2O3(3D) RPCs in the infiltration simulation.},

ABSTRACT = {Many endothermic liquid–liquid transitions, occurring at a temperature Tn+ above the melting temperature Tm, are related to previous exothermic transitions, occurring at a temperature Tx after glass formation below Tg, with or without attached crystallization and predicted by the nonclassical homogenous nucleation equation. A new thermodynamic phase composed of broken bonds (configurons), driven by percolation thresholds, varying from ~0.145 to Δε, is formed at Tx, with a constant enthalpy up to Tn+. The liquid fraction Δε is a liquid glass up to Tn+. The solid phase contains glass and crystals. Molecular dynamics simulations are used to induce, in NiTi2, a reversible first-order transition by varying the temperature between 300 and 1000 K under a pressure of 1000 GPa. Cooling to 300 K, without applied pressure, shows the liquid glass presence with Δε = 0.22335 as memory effect and Tn+ = 2120 K for Tm = 1257 K.},

ABSTRACT = {Cylindrical specimens are of great interest in analyzing mechanical elements’ behavior and investigating phenomena with biaxial loads. It is necessary to identify the behavior of the crack front along the thickness to interpret these results, which are usually based on the hypothesis of a straight crack and the observation of the outer face of the crack front. Based on the work carried out on compact tension type specimens, this work proposes adapting this methodology to cylindrical specimens, adapting the previous finite element models. Cylindrical specimens provide an asymmetric behavior influenced by the radius, where the CT (compact tensile) specimen can be considered the extreme infinite radius case. Combinations of the load level and radius values help us simulate the crack’s behavior under intermediate hypotheses between a plane crack theory and a three-dimensional one. The plastic strain around the crack front will be analyzed as a function of the thickness and the load level applied. The results allow us to validate the numerical methodology and establish the differentiated behaviors of the plastic zones close to the outer and inner radii.},

ABSTRACT = {Mean-field models have the ability to predict the evolution of grain size distribution that occurs through thermomechanical solicitations. This article focuses on a comparison of mean-field models under grain-growth conditions. Different microstructure representations are considered and discussed, especially regarding the consideration of topology in the neighborhood construction. Experimental data obtained with a heat treatment campaign on 316L austenitic stainless steel are used for the identification of material parameters and as a reference for model comparisons. Mean-field models are also applied to both mono- and bimodal initial grain size distributions to investigate the potential benefits of introducing neighborhood topology in microstructure prediction models. This article demonstrates that improvements in the predictions can be obtained in monomodal cases for topological models. In the bimodal test, no comparison with experimental data was performed as no data were available. But relative comparisons between models indicated few differences in the predictions. Although of interest, the consideration of neighborhood topology in grain-growth mean-field models generally results in only small improvements compared to classical mean-field models, especially in terms of implementation complexity.},

ABSTRACT = {In view of the differences in the applicability and prediction ability of different creep rupture life prediction models, we propose a creep rupture life prediction method in this paper. Various time–temperature parametric models, machine learning models, and a new method combining time–temperature parametric models with machine learning models are used to predict the creep rupture life of a small-sample material. The prediction accuracy of each model is quantitatively compared using model evaluation indicators (RMSE, MAPE, R2), and the output values of the most accurate model are used as the output values of the prediction method. The prediction method not only improves the applicability and accuracy of creep rupture life predictions but also quantifies the influence of each input variable on creep rupture life through the machine learning model. A new method is proposed in order to effectively take advantage of both advanced machine learning models and classical time–temperature parametric models. Parametric equations of creep rupture life, stress, and temperature are obtained using different time–temperature parametric models; then, creep rupture life data, obtained via equations under other temperature and stress conditions, are used to expand the training set data of different machine learning models. By expanding the data of different intervals, the problem of the low accuracy of the machine learning model for the small-sample material is solved.},

ABSTRACT = {Two-phase lithium ceramic Li2TiO3-Li4SiO4 is considered as a tritium multiplier for use in the solid blanket of fusion reactors. To date, the most accurate understanding of the processes of tritium and helium production and release occurring in the breeder blanket materials under neutron irradiation can only be obtained from experiments in fission research reactors. At that, irradiations in vacuum give the possibility to register even very fast gas release processes (bursts) from the ceramics’ voids and pores, although it reduces the thermal conductivity of the pebble bed. The purpose of this work was to simulate the heating of mono-sized pebble bed (1 mm in diameter) of two-phase lithium ceramic 25 mol%Li2TiO3+75 mol%Li4SiO4 in an ampoule device during neutron irradiation at the WWR-K research reactor under vacuum conditions, and to determine experimental parameters in order to prevent heating of the lithium ceramics up to the Li4SiO4-Li2SiO3 phase transition temperatures (>900 °C). For the first time, it was obtained that the effective thermal conductivity of a 1 mm mono-sized pebble bed of 25 mol%Li2TiO3+75 mol%Li4SiO4 significantly decreases (four times) when it is irradiated with neutrons in a vacuum (at a helium pressure of approximately 10 Pa), compared to a similar calculation at 100 kPa of helium (when the He sweep is used). It was concluded that it is difficult to evaluate the maximal temperature of the ceramics in the capsule by measuring the temperature of its outer metal wall (according to thermocouple readings) without using the results of thermophysical calculations for each type of ceramic, taking into account its quantity, specific heat release and pebble size(s). To control the temperature of the ceramics during an irradiation experiment in a vacuum, an in-capsule thermocouple should be used, placed in the center of the pebble bed. Measuring the temperature of the pebble bed based on the capsule wall temperature can lead to overheating of the ceramics and phase changes.},

ABSTRACT = {Austenite–ferrite phase transformation is a crucial metallurgical tool to tailor the properties of steels required for particular applications. Extensive simulation and modeling studies have been conducted to evaluate the phase transformation behaviors; however, some fundamental physical parameters still need to be optimized for better understanding. In this study, the austenite–ferrite phase transformation was evaluated in carbon steels with three carbon concentrations during isothermal annealing at various temperatures using a developed cellular automaton simulation model combined with Bayesian optimization. The simulation results show that the incubation period for nucleation is an essential factor that needs to be considered during austenite–ferrite phase transformation simulation. The incubation period constant is mainly affected by carbon concentration and the optimized values have been obtained as 10−24, 10−19, and 10−21 corresponding to carbon concentrations of 0.2 wt%, 0.35 wt%, and 0.5 wt%, respectively. The average ferrite grain size after phase transformation completion could decrease with the decreasing initial austenite grain size. Some other parameters were also analyzed in detail. The developed cellular automaton simulation model combined with Bayesian optimization in this study could conduct an in-depth exploration of critical and optimal parameters and provide deeper insights into understanding the fundamental physical characteristics during austenite–ferrite phase transformation.},

ABSTRACT = {Selective laser melting (SLM) can effectively replace traditional processing methods to prepare parts with arbitrary complex shapes through layer-by-layer accumulation. However, SLM Ti-6Al-4V alloy typically exhibits low ductility and significant mechanical properties anisotropy due to the presence of acicular α′ martensite and columnar prior β grains. Post-heat treatment is frequently used to obtain superior mechanical properties by decomposing acicular α′ martensite into an equilibrium α + β phase. In this study, the microstructure and tensile properties of SLM Ti-6Al-4V alloy before and after various heat treatments were systematically investigated. The microstructure of the as-fabricated Ti-6Al-4V sample was composed of columnar prior β grains and acicular α′ martensite, which led to high strength (~1400 MPa) but low ductility (~5%) as well as significantly tensile anisotropy. The single heat treatment samples with lamellar α + β microstructure exhibited improved elongation to 6.8–13.1% with a sacrifice of strength of 100–200 MPa, while the tensile anisotropy was weakened. A trimodal microstructure was achieved through multi-step high-to-low-temperature (HLT) heat treatment, resulting in an excellent combination of strength (~1090 MPa) and ductility (~17%), while the tensile anisotropy was almost eliminated. The comprehensive mechanical properties of the HLT samples were superior to that of the conventional manufactured Ti-6Al-4V alloy.},

ABSTRACT = {The aim of this study is to comprehensively examine the structural composition and properties of the AgAlS2 crystal during its high-pressure phase. This analysis delves into the second coordination environment of the crystal structure and elucidates the distinct transformations it undergoes during the phase transition. The band energy structure was calculated, and the origin of electronic levels was clarified. It is shown that the crystal becomes non-stratified during the phase transition. This study also determined the values of the crystal’s carrier effective masses, underscoring its spatial anisotropy. It was found that the calculated optical functions are similar to the crystal in the chalcopyrite structure, and their differences are shown. Further, this study involved the calculation of the crystal’s phonon spectrum, revealing the spectrum’s transformation during the phase transition. The vibrational frequencies were also obtained, with a symmetrical classification of vibrational modes. Finally, this study derived the infrared and Raman spectra of the AgAlS2 crystal, thereby providing a comprehensive picture of the crystal during its high-pressure phase.},

ABSTRACT = {Rheological test standards require asphalt samples, both original and under ageing conditions. The most common laboratory equipment in specifications for short-term and long-term ageing simulation tests are the rolling thin film oven (RTFO) and the pressure ageing vessel (PAV). However, the cost of acquiring PAV and the duration of long-term ageing tests can be a limiting factor. This work aimed to establish the equivalent time of the long-term ageing test in the RTFO that corresponds to the PAV. For this, the Brazilian asphalt PEN 50/70, specified by penetration, was aged at different times (85, 170, 255, and 340 min) in the RTFO at the standard temperature (163 °C). For each time, using a dynamic shear rheometer (DSR), tests such as Multiple Stress Creep Recovery (MSCR) and Linear Amplitude Sweep (LAS) were performed, and the rheological properties (complex modulus (G*) and phase angle (δ)) were measured. The same tests were conducted on the samples aged in the long term and in the PAV. The test parameters obtained from applying different times while using the RTFO were compared with the PAV results, and the equivalent time was settled through linear regression, resulting in 300 min. In order to confirm the equivalent time, samples aged in the RTFO for 300 min were assessed using the same rheological tests, and the parameters were compared to those obtained after PAV ageing. At the equivalent time, the difference between RTFO and the PAV for the rutting parameter (G*/sinδ, 58 °C) was 6%, while for the fatigue parameter (G*.sinδ, 19 °C), the difference was 1.0%. The MSCR non-recoverable creep compliance parameter differences, considering stress levels of 0.1 kPa and 3.2 kPa, were 9.7% and 11.7%, respectively. For the fatigue life obtained in the LAS test at strain levels of 1.25% and 2.5%, the difference between RTFO and PAV, at the equivalent time, was 7.6% and 7.8%, respectively. For the Brazilian unmodified asphalt PEN 50/70 and parameters evaluated in this work, 300 min is the equivalent time that simulates long-term ageing in the RTFO.},

ABSTRACT = {This study focuses on Metal Additive Manufacturing (AM), an emerging method known for its ability to create lightweight components and intricate designs. However, Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF), a prominent AM technique, faces a major challenge due to the development of high residual stress, resulting in flawed parts and printing failures. The study’s goal was to assess the thermal behaviour of different support structures and optimised designs to reduce the support volume and residual stress while ensuring high-quality prints. To explore this, L-shaped specimens were printed using block-type support structures through an LPBF machine. This process was subsequently validated through numerical simulations, which were in alignment with experimental observations. In addition to block-type support structures, line, contour, and cone supports were examined numerically to identify the optimal solutions that minimise the support volume and residual stress while maintaining high-quality prints. The optimisation approach was based on the Design of Experiments (DOE) methodology and multi-objective optimisation. The findings revealed that block supports exhibited excellent thermal behaviour. High-density supports outperformed low-density alternatives in temperature distribution, while cone-type supports were more susceptible to warping. These insights provide valuable guidance for improving the metal AM and LPBF processes, enabling their broader use in industries like aerospace, medical, defence, and automotive.},

ABSTRACT = {Dilatometric experiments were conducted with the main purpose of measuring the transformation-induced coefficients of 13% chromium and 4% nickel, which are martensitic stainless steel base and filler materials used for hydraulic turbine manufacturing. To this end, a set of experiments was conducted in a quenching dilatometer equipped with loading capabilities. The measurement system was further improved by means of modified pushrods to allow for the use of specimens with geometries that are compliant with tensile test standards. This improvement allowed for the measurement of the materials’ phases and respective yield strengths. The dataset was further used to determine the relationship between the applied external stress and the martensitic start temperature (Ms) upon cooling. The TRIP coefficient’s K values for both the S41500 steel and E410NiMo filler material were measured at 8.12×10−5 and 7.11×10−5, respectively. Additionally, the solid phase transformation model parameters for both the austenitic and martensitic transformation of the filler material were measured. These parameters were then used to model austenitic-phase-transformation kinetics and martensite transformation, including transformation-induced plasticity effects. Good agreement was achieved between the calculation and the experiments.},

ABSTRACT = {A comprehensive study concerning the phase formation mechanism and growth/dissolution kinetics of sodium tungsten bronze crystals during the electrolysis of a 0.8Na2WO4–0.2WO3 melt was carried out. The regularities of deposit formation on a Pt(111) working electrode were investigated experimentally using cyclic voltammetry, chronoamperometry, scanning electron microscopy, and X-ray diffraction analysis. Models have been developed to calculate the current response during the formation, growth and dissolution of a two-phase deposit consisting of NaxWO3 and metallic tungsten or two oxide tungsten bronzes with different sodium content. These models consider mass transfer to the electrode and nuclei; chemical and electrochemical reactions with the participation of polytungstate ions, Na+, Na0, and O2−; as well as the ohmic drop effect. The approach was proposed to describe the dissolution of an NaxWO3 crystal with a nonuniform sodium distribution. The fitting of cyclic voltammograms was performed using the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm. The NaxWO3 formation/growth/dissolution mechanism was determined. Concentration profiles and diffusion coefficients of [WnO3n]−, reaction rate constants, number density of nuclei, and time dependencies of crystal size were calculated. The proposed approaches and models can be used in other systems for the cyclic voltammogram analysis and study of the mechanism and kinetics of electrode processes complicated by phase formation; parallel and sequential electrochemical and chemical reactions; as well as the formation of a deposit characterized by a nonuniform phase and/or chemical composition.},

ABSTRACT = {This work is focused on the development of creep and stress relaxation models on Inconel 625 and Stainless Steel 310 materials for additive manufacturing. At the end, the operational lifespan of an industrial-scale additive manufactured recuperator is evaluated. An industrial-scale recuperator for burners with a highly complex geometry is manufactured using Continuous Wave SLM and Pulsed Wave Selective Laser Melting techniques. The recuperator operates under steady but high thermal loads, reaching temperatures of up to 875 °C. Therefore, its service life is assessed, considering creep and stress relaxation phenomena. Two different materials are evaluated: Inconel 625 and Stainless Steel 310. Tensile testing has been conducted on samples at various temperatures to acquire material parameters, incorporating appropriately the anisotropic nature of the materials. Creep parameters were determined through creep experiments and data from the literature, and the recuperator response was simulated by FEA modelling. Analytical creep and stress relaxation models were proposed based on the simulation results for each material to predict their creep response. The service life was determined by applying a custom failure criterion based on the creep testing data. The Inconel 625 recuperator exhibits a service life that is significantly higher compared to any burner’s life, while the Stainless Steel 310 recuperator exhibits approximately 27 years of service life. Both materials are considered suitable; however, Inconel 625 offers higher resistance to creep according to creep tests, and due to its lower thermal expansion coefficient, the resulting thermal stresses are lower.},

We propose an automated segmentation technique for high-tensile strength alloy steel, where the complexity of microstructures presents considerable challenges. Our method leverages the UNet architecture, originally developed for biomedical image segmentation, and optimizes its performance via careful hyper-parameter selection and data augmentation. We employ Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD) imagery for complex-phase segmentation and utilize a combined loss function to capture both textural and structural characteristics of the microstructures. Additionally, this work is the first to examine the scalability of the model across varying magnifications and types of steel and achieves high accuracy in terms of dice scores demonstrating the adaptability and robustness of the model.},

ABSTRACT = {The scientific community has raised increasing apprehensions over the transparency and interpretability of machine learning models employed in various domains, particularly in the field of materials science. The intrinsic intricacy of these models frequently results in their characterization as “black boxes”, which poses a difficulty in emphasizing the significance of producing lucid and readily understandable model outputs. In addition, the assessment of model performance requires careful deliberation of several essential factors. The objective of this study is to utilize a deep learning framework called TabNet to predict lead zirconate titanate (PZT) ceramics’ dielectric constant property by employing their components and processes. By recognizing the crucial importance of predicting PZT properties, this research seeks to enhance the comprehension of the results generated by the model and gain insights into the association between the model and predictor variables using various input parameters. To achieve this, we undertake a thorough analysis with Shapley additive explanations (SHAP). In order to enhance the reliability of the prediction model, a variety of cross-validation procedures are utilized. The study demonstrates that the TabNet model significantly outperforms traditional machine learning models in predicting ceramic characteristics of PZT components, achieving a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.047 and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.042. Key contributing factors, such as d33, tangent loss, and chemical formula, are identified using SHAP plots, highlighting their importance in predictive analysis. Interestingly, process time is less effective in predicting the dielectric constant. This research holds considerable potential for advancing materials discovery and predictive systems in PZT ceramics, offering deep insights into the roles of various parameters.},

ABSTRACT = {We present an in-depth investigation into the Radiation-Induced Segregation (RIS) phenomenon in Ni-Cr alloys. All the pivotal factors affecting RIS such as surface’s absorption efficiency, grain size, production bias, dose rate, temperature, and sink density were systematically studied. Through comprehensive simulations, the individual and collective impacts of these factors were analyzed, enabling a refined understanding of RIS. A notable finding was the significant influence of production bias on point defects’ interactions with grain boundaries/surfaces, thereby playing a crucial role in RIS processes. Production bias alters the neutrality of these interactions, leading to a preferential absorption of one type of point defect by the boundary and consequent establishment of distinct surface-mediated patterns of point defects. These spatial patterns further result in non-monotonic spatial profiles of solute atoms near surfaces/grain boundaries, corroborated by experimental observations. In particular, a positive production bias, signifying a higher production rate of vacancies over interstitials, drives more Cr depletion at the grain boundary. Moreover, a temperature-dependent production bias must be considered to recover the experimentally reported dependence of RIS on temperature. The severity of radiation damage and RIS becomes more pronounced with increased production bias, dose rate, and grain size, while high temperatures or sink density suppress the RIS severity. Model predictions were validated against experimental data, showcasing robust qualitative and quantitative agreements. The findings pave the way for further exploration of these spatial dependencies in subsequent studies, aiming to augment the comprehension and predictability of RIS processes in alloys.},

ABSTRACT = {Locked-in stress refers to internal stress present within rock formations that can influence the failure process of rocks under specific conditions. A simplified mechanical model is applied, drawing on elasticity and the hypothesis of locked-in stress, to explore the influence of locked-in stress on the mechanical properties of loaded rocks. An analytical solution is obtained for the stress distribution in a failure model of rocks that include locked-in stress. The findings demonstrate that the geometry and orientation of stress inclusions within the rock influence the initiation and propagation of cracks under the combined influence of locked-in stress and high-stress conditions. Moreover, the presence of locked-in stress substantially reduces the rock’s capacity to withstand maximum stress, thereby increasing its susceptibility to reaching a state of failure. The increase in closure stress leads to a significant increase in the magnitude of the maximum stress drop and radial strain variation within the rock, resulting in reduced strength and a shortened life of the ageing failure of the rock. In addition, the influence of stress inclusions on energy dissipation is investigated, and a novel relationship is established between the roughness coefficient of the rock structure surface and the angle of the rock failure surface. This relationship serves to characterize the linear dynamic strength properties of rock materials containing locked-in stress. This investigation not only advances the comprehension of stress distribution patterns and the effects of locked-in stress on rock failure patterns but also facilitates a more precise portrayal of the nonlinear features of alterations in the rock stress-strain curve under the influence of confined stress. These findings provide a solid theoretical foundation for ensuring the safety of excavations in various deep engineering projects.},

ABSTRACT = {Dual-phase (DP) steel has been widely used in automotive steel plates with a balance of excellent strength and ductility. Grain refinement in DP steel is important to improve the properties further; however, the factors affecting grain growth need to be well understood. The remaining problem is that acquiring data through experiments is still time-consuming and difficult to evaluate quantitatively. With the development of materials informatics in recent years, material development time and costs are expected to be significantly reduced through experimentation, simulation, and machine learning. In this study, grain growth behavior in DP steel was studied using two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) Monte Carlo modeling and simulation to estimate the effect of some key parameters. Grain growth can be suppressed when the grain boundary energy is greater than the phase boundary energy. When the volume fractions of the matrix and the second phase were equal, the suppression of grain growth became obvious. The long-distance diffuse frequency can promote grain growth significantly. The simulation results allow us to better understand the factors affecting grain growth behavior in DP steel. Machine learning was performed to conduct a sensitivity analysis of the affecting parameters and estimate the magnitude of each parameter’s effects on grain growth in the model. Combining MC simulation and machine learning will provide one promising research strategy to gain deeper insights into grain growth behaviors in metallic materials and accelerate the research process.},

ABSTRACT = {Noise manipulation at the subwavelength scale remains a challenging problem. To obtain better broadband sound isolation within the subwavelength range, a class of asymmetric acoustic metamaterials (AAMs) based on rotation is proposed, and this class of AAMs can further improve subwavelength sound isolation performance by introducing multi-orders. The influences of changing the alternate propagation length of the coiled channel and the square cavity in the unit cell on the band frequency distribution and the omnidirectional band structure were investigated. The effective parameters are calculated with the S-parameter retrieval method, and the generation and change mechanisms of the bandgaps were elucidated. The calculation of sound transmission characteristics showed that, in the asymmetric mode, the overall sound isolation performance of the structure was greatly improved, and the relative bandwidth expanded as the alternate propagation length of the coiled channel and square cavity increased. The omnidirectional bandgaps from the first-order to the third-order AAMs occupied 63.6%, 75.96%, and 76.84% of the subwavelength range, respectively. In particular, the first bandgap moves to the low frequency and becomes wider. Both the experimental results and numerical analyses consistently showed that disrupting structural symmetry enhances acoustic metamaterials for superior broadband sound isolation, inspiring broader applications for asymmetry in this field.},

ABSTRACT = {In this study, the efficiency of mechanically alloyed Fe80Si10B10 in degrading basic red 46 azo dye is investigated. Moreover, the influences of different parameters, such as pH and time, on the elimination of the aromatic derivatives obtained as by-products of the fracture of the azo group are also analyzed. After beginning the reduction to the normal conditions of pH (4.6) and temperature, the experimental findings showed a discoloration of 97.87% after 20 min. The structure and morphology of the nanocrystalline Fe80Si10B10 powder were characterized by SEM and XRD before and after use in the degradation process. The XRD patterns of the Fe–Si–B powder after redox reaction suggest that the valent zero Fe of the alloy is the reducing agent. Powdered cork was then used as a biosorbent for the removal of the by-products generated, resulting in increasing removal percentages from pH 7 (26%) to pH 9 (62%) and a contact time of 120 min. The FTIR spectrum of the cork after adsorption shows a shift of the bands, confirming the interaction with the aromatic amines. The present findings show that metallic powders and natural cork perform well together in removing azo dye solutions and their degradation products.},

ABSTRACT = {Convection has a nonnegligible effect on the growth of the magnesium dendrite with six-primary-branch pattern. Most work, however, investigates the effect of the convection by simplifying the melt flow as a constant horizontal flow. In this work, four convection behaviors, including equally distributed convection, linearly distributed convection, sinusoidal-wave convection, and square-wave convection, are imposed and simulated through the phase-field lattice-Boltzmann schemes. The effects of constant (the former two) and altering (the latter two) flow fields are quantified by the length ratio of the upstream primary arm to the downstream one. The results show that the dendrite asymmetry increases under the constant forced convections but presents nonmonotonic change under the altering convections. A simple mathematical relation is fitted to summarize the dependence of the dendrite asymmetry on the input velocity, the undercooling, and the flow frequency. Deep understanding of the convection effects can guide the prediction and control of the magnesium dendrite under more complex situations.},

ABSTRACT = {Mastering the variations in the stability of a polarization vortex is fundamental for the development of ferroelectric devices based on polarization vortex domain structures. Some phase field simulations were conducted on PbTiO3 nanofilms with an initial polarization vortex under uniaxial tension or compression to investigate the conditions of vortex instability and the effects of aspect ratio of nanofilms and temperature on them. The instability of a polarization vortex is strongly dependent on aspect ratio and temperature. The critical compressive stress increases with decreasing aspect ratio under the action of compressive stress. However, the critical tensile stress first decreases and then increases with decreasing aspect ratio, then continues to decrease. There are two inflection points in the curve. In addition, an elevated temperature makes both the critical tensile and compressive stresses decline, and will also cause the aspect ratio corresponding to the inflection point to decrease. These are very important for the design of promising nano-ferroelectric devices based on polarization vortices to improve their performance while maintaining storage density.},

ABSTRACT = {The Qinghai–Tibet Plateau is the main permafrost area in China. Concrete structures constructed on permafrost are affected by the early negative-temperature environment. In particular, the negative-temperature environment seriously affects the strength growth process and the frost resistance of concrete (FRC). Therefore, this study considered the influence of the gas content, water–binder ratio (w/b), age, and other factors on the strength variation law and FRC under −3 °C curing conditions. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) was used to analyze the pore structure of concrete before and after freeze–thaw cycles (FTCs). The results showed that the compressive strength of the concrete (CSC) under −3 °C curing was only 57.8–86.4% of that cured under standard conditions. The CSC under −3 °C curing showed an obvious age-lag phenomenon. The FRC under −3 °C curing was much lower than that under standard curing. The porosity of the concrete under −3 °C curing was greater, with a higher percentage of harmful and multi-harmful pores than that under standard curing. The concrete properties deteriorated primarily because curing at −3 °C hindered the hydration reaction compared with standard methods. This hindrance resulted in diminished hydration development, weakening the concrete’s structural integrity. Under both curing conditions, when the gas content was between 3.2% and 3.8%, the frost resistance was the best. This is because a gas content within this range effectively enhances the internal pore structure, therefore relieving the swelling pressure caused by FTCs. Based on the freeze–thaw damage (FTD) model proposed by previous authors, a new model for the CSC under −3 °C curing reaching that of the concrete under standard curing for 28 d was established in this study. This advanced model was capable of accurately assessing the FTD of concrete structures in permafrost regions. Finally, the life expectancy of concrete in Northwest China was predicted. The life of the concrete reached 46.9 years under standard curing, while the longest life of the concrete under −3 °C curing was only 12.9 years. Therefore, attention should be paid to constructing and curing concrete structures in cold environments.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper presents a new anisotropic visco-hyperelastic constitutive model for finite bending of an incompressible rectangular elastomeric material. The proposed approach is based on the Mooney–Rivlin anisotropic strain energy function and non-linear visco-hyperelastic method. In this study, we aim to examine the mechanical response of a reinforced viscoelastic rectangular bar with a group of fibers under bending. Anisotropic materials are typically composed of one (or more) family of reinforcing fibers embedded within a soft matrix material. This operation may lead to an enhancement in the strength and stiffness of soft materials. In addition, a finite element simulation is carried out to validate the accuracy of the analytical solution. In this research, the well-known stress relaxation test, as well as the multi-step relaxation test, are examined both analytically and numerically. The results obtained from the analytical solution are found to be in good agreement with those from the finite element method. Therefore, it can be deduced that the proposed model is competent in describing the mechanical behavior of fiber-reinforced materials when subjected to finite bending deformations.},

ABSTRACT = {Polymer composites, hailed for their ultra-strength and lightweight attributes, stand out as promising materials for the upcoming era of space vehicles. The selection of the polymer matrix plays a pivotal role in material design, given its significant impact on bulk-level properties through the reinforcement/polymer interface. To aid in the systematic design of such composite systems, molecular-level calculations are employed to establish the relationship between interfacial characteristics and mechanical response, specifically stiffness. This study focuses on the interaction of fluorinated and non-fluorinated cyanate ester monomers with graphene or a BN monolayer, representing non-polymerized ester composites. Utilizing micromechanics and the density functional theory method to analyze interaction energy, charge density, and stiffness, our findings reveal that the fluorinated cyanate-ester monomer demonstrates lower interaction energy, reduced pull-apart force, and a higher separation point compared to the non-fluorinated counterpart. This behavior is attributed to the steric hindrance caused by fluorine atoms. Furthermore, the BN monolayer exhibits enhanced transverse stiffness due to increased interfacial strength, stemming from the polar nature of B–N bonds on the surface, as opposed to the C-C bonds of graphene. These molecular-level results are intended to inform the design of next-generation composites incorporating cyanate esters, specifically for structural applications.},

ABSTRACT = {The abnormal grain growth of steel, which is occurs during carburization, adversely affects properties such as heat treatment deformation and fatigue strength. This study aimed to control abnormal grain growth by controlling the materials and processes. Thus, it was necessary to investigate the effects of microstructure, precipitation, and heat treatment conditions on abnormal grain growth. We simulated abnormal grain growth using the cellular automaton (CA) method. The simulations focused on the grain boundary anisotropy and dispersion of precipitates. We considered the effect of grain boundary misorientation on boundary energy and mobility. The dispersion state of the precipitates and its pinning effect were considered, and grain growth simulations were performed. The results showed that the CA simulation reproduced abnormal grain growth by emphasizing the grain boundary mobility and the influence of the dispersion state of the precipitate on the occurrence of abnormal grain growth. The study findings show that the CA method is a potential technique for the prediction of abnormal grain growth.},

ABSTRACT = {Stainless steel is a cold-work-hardened material. The degree and mechanism of hardening depend on the grade and family of the steel. This characteristic has a direct effect on the mechanical behaviour of stainless steel when it is cold-formed. Since cold rolling is one of the most widespread processes for manufacturing flat stainless steel products, the prediction of their strain-hardening mechanical properties is of great importance to materials engineering. This work uses artificial neural networks (ANNs) to forecast the mechanical properties of the stainless steel as a function of the chemical composition and the applied cold thickness reduction. Multiple linear regression (MLR) is also used as a benchmark model. To achieve this, both traditional and new-generation austenitic, ferritic, and duplex stainless steel sheets are cold-rolled at a laboratory scale with different thickness reductions after the industrial intermediate annealing stage. Subsequently, the mechanical properties of the cold-rolled sheets are determined by tensile tests, and the experimental cold-rolling curves are drawn based on those results. A database is created from these curves to generate a model applying machine learning techniques to predict the values of the tensile strength (Rm), yield strength (Rp), hardness (H), and elongation (A) based on the chemical composition and the applied cold thickness reduction. These models can be used as supporting tools for designing and developing new stainless steel grades and/or adjusting cold-forming processes.},

ABSTRACT = {Interatomic potentials play a crucial role in the molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of silicon carbide (SiC). However, the ability of interatomic potentials to accurately describe certain physical properties of SiC has yet to be confirmed, particularly for hexagonal SiC. In this study, the mechanical, thermal, and defect properties of four SiC structures (3C-, 2H-, 4H-, and 6H-SiC) have been calculated with multiple interatomic potentials using the MD method, and then compared with the results obtained from density functional theory and experiments to assess the descriptive capabilities of these interatomic potentials. The results indicate that the T05 potential is suitable for describing the elastic constant and modulus of SiC. Thermal calculations show that the Vashishta, environment-dependent interatomic potential (EDIP), and modified embedded atom method (MEAM) potentials effectively describe the vibrational properties of SiC, and the T90 potential provides a better description of the thermal conductivity of SiC. The EDIP potential has a significant advantage in describing point defect formation energy in hexagonal SiC, and the GW potential is suitable for describing vacancy migration in hexagonal SiC. Furthermore, the T90 and T94 potentials can effectively predict the surface energies of the three low-index surfaces of 3C-SiC, and the Vashishta potential exhibits excellent capabilities in describing stacking fault properties in SiC. This work will be helpful for selecting a potential for SiC simulations.},

ABSTRACT = {Structures made of heterogeneous materials, such as composites, often require a multiscale approach when their behavior is simulated using the finite element method. By solving the boundary value problem of the macroscale model, for previously homogenized material properties, the resulting stress maps can be obtained. However, such stress results do not describe the actual behavior of the material and are often significantly different from the actual stresses in the heterogeneous microstructure. Finding high-accuracy stress results for such materials leads to time-consuming analyses in both scales. This paper focuses on the application of machine learning to multiscale analysis of structures made of composite materials, to substantially decrease the time of computations of such localization problems. The presented methodology was validated by a numerical example where a structure made of resin epoxy with randomly distributed short glass fibers was analyzed using a computational multiscale approach. Carefully prepared training data allowed artificial neural networks to learn relationships between two scales and significantly increased the efficiency of the multiscale approach.},

ABSTRACT = {The Ti-6Al-4V (TC4) alloy wheel hub has exhibited some defects that affect the properties during the vertical centrifugal casting process. Therefore, the analysis of the solidification process would contribute to solving the above-mentioned problems. In this study, an orthogonal experimental design was employed to optimize the process parameters (rotational speed, mold preheating temperature, and pouring temperature) of the vertical centrifugal casting method. The effects of process parameters on the velocity field, temperature field, and total shrinkage porosity during the solidification process were explored, and the microstructure and mechanical properties of the wheel hub prepared by the vertical centrifugal casting method were also investigated. The results showed that the rotational speed mainly induced the change of the velocity field. The pouring temperature and mold preheating temperature affected the temperature field and solidification time. Based on the analysis of the orthogonal experiment, the optimal parameters were confirmed as a rotational speed of 225 rpm, mold preheating temperature of 400 °C, and pouring temperature of 1750 °C, respectively. The simulation results of total shrinkage porosity were in agreement with the experiment results. The wheel hub was composed of nonuniform α and β phases. The lath α phase precipitated from larger β grains with different orientations. Compared with the other samples at different locations, the α phase in the PM sample (middle of the TC4 wheel hub) displayed high peak intensity and uniformly distributed β phase along the radial direction of the wheel hub. Moreover, the PM sample revealed a higher tensile strength of 820 MPa and similar Vickers hardness of 318 HV compared with the other samples at different locations, which were higher than those of rolling and extrusion molding. This experiment design would provide a good reference for the vertical centrifugal casting of the TC4 alloy.},

ABSTRACT = {The aim of this study is to solve a practical problem encountered in the automotive industry, especially the failure of a cracked lower control arm made of al 6062 T6 material during static and crash physical tests, and to characterize the behavior of cracked parts made of aluminum materials using the fracture mechanics parameters. As a first step, we carried out a numerical study and simulation using Abaqus/CAE 2020 software and the finite element method to determine the stress concentration and load limit capacity for different car weight cases. The von Mises stress variation shows crack initiation and propagation to be in the area of the lower control arm’s attachment to the vehicle platform, where stress is concentrated. These numerical results are consistent with the experimental test results found by automotive manufacturers. Also, we find that the mechanical load that can support this part is below 4900 N for good performance. In the second step, we use the results of the first section to simulate the failure of a lower control arm with a crack defect. This paper investigates the stress intensity factor KI in mode I for different lengths (L) and depths (a) of the crack in the lower control arm using the extended finite element method (XFEM) under Abaqus/CAE. For crack failure initiation and progression, we relied on the traction separation law, specifically the maximum principal stress (MAXPS) criterion. The KI factor was evaluated for the materials steel and Al 6062 T6. The results obtained from the variation of the KI coefficient as a function of crack depth (a) and the thickness (t) show that the crack remains stable even when a depth ratio (a/t = 0.8) is reached for the steel material. However, the crack in the Aluminum 6062 T6 material becomes unstable at depth (a/t = 0.6), with a high risk of total failure of the lower control arm.},

ABSTRACT = {The mechanical properties of a defect-free laser melting (PBF-LB) deposit of an AISI 316L steel alloy were assessed by means of an instrumented indentation test (IIT), at both the macro- and nano-scales. The inherent non-equilibrium microstructure of the alloy was chemically homogenous and consisted of equiaxed grains and large-elongated grains (under the optical microscope) with irregular outlines composed of a much finer internal cell structure (under the scanning electron microscope). Berkovich and Vickers indenters were used to assess the indentation properties across individual grains (nano) and over multiple grains (macro), respectively. The nano-indentation over the X-Y plane revealed nearly constant indentation modulus across an individual grain but variable on average within different grains whose value depended on the relative orientation of the individual grain. The macro-indentation test was conducted to analyze the tensile-like properties of the polycrystalline SS 316L alloy over the X-Y and Y-Z planes. The macro-indentation test provided a reliable estimate of the ultimate tensile strength (UTS-like) of the alloy. Other indentation properties gave inconsistent results, and a post factum analysis was, therefore, conducted, by means of a new approach, to account for the presence of residual stresses. The already existing indentation data were supplemented with new repeated indentation tests to conduct a detailed analysis of the relaxation ability of compressive and tensile residual stresses. The developed methodology allows the effect of residual stresses and the reliability of measured macro-indentation properties to be examined as a function of a small group of indentation parameters.},

ABSTRACT = {The manufacturing processes and design of metal and alloy products can be performed over a wide range of strain rates and temperatures. To design and optimize these processes using computational mechanics tools, the selection and calibration of the constitutive models is critical. In the case of hazardous and explosive impact loads, it is not always possible to test material properties. For this purpose, this paper assesses the efficiency and the accuracy of different architectures of ANNs for the identification of the Johnson–Cook material model parameters. The implemented computational tool of an ANN-based parameter identification strategy provides adequate results in a range of strain rates required for general manufacturing and product design applications. Four ANN architectures are studied to find the most suitable configuration for a reduced amount of experimental data, particularly for cases where high-impact testing is constrained. The different ANN structures are evaluated based on the model’s predictive capability, revealing that the perceptron-based network of 66 inputs and one hidden layer of 30 neurons provides the highest prediction accuracy of the effective flow stress–strain behavior of Ti64 alloy and three virtual materials.},

ABSTRACT = {This study aims to enhance the productivity of high-voltage transmission line insulators and their operational safety by investigating their failure mechanisms under ultimate load conditions. Destructive tests were conducted on a specific type of insulator under ultimate load conditions. A high-speed camera was used to document the insulator’s failure process and collect strain data from designated points. A simulation model of the insulator was established to predict the effects of ultimate loads. The simulation results identified a maximum first principal stress of 94.549 MPa in the porcelain shell, with stress distribution characteristics resembling a cantilever beam subjected to bending. This implied that the insulator failure occurred when the stress reached the bending strength of the porcelain shell. To validate the simulation’s accuracy, bending and tensile strength tests were conducted on the ceramic materials constituting the insulator. The bending strength of the porcelain shell was 100.52 MPa, showing a 5.6% variation from the simulation results, which indicated the reliability of the simulation model. Finally, optimization designs on the design parameters P1 and P2 of the insulator were conducted. The results indicated that setting P1 to 8° and P2 to 90.062 mm decreased the first principal stress of the porcelain shell by 47.6% and Von Mises stress by 31.6% under ultimate load conditions, significantly enhancing the load-bearing capacity. This research contributed to improving the production yield and safety performance of insulators.},

ABSTRACT = {Before a new type of engine is introduced into civil aviation, it must comply with various safety regulations. These regulations include the analysis of secondary damage caused by the re-ingestion of a tooth fragment. The purpose is to prevent crack propagation through the gear rim, which would lead to catastrophic failure. In this context, identification of the initial crack location is crucial to determine the crack propagation path. Therefore, this paper presents a technique to determine and validate a constitutive material model and fracture locus for case-hardened spur gears. As the modelling of the surface-hardened layer is computationally intensive, it is necessary to homogenise the model. This paper comprehensively reviews and discusses the associated effects and errors. To determine the plastic behaviour of the case-hardened external gear (30CrNiMo8) and the nitrided internal gear (35CrAlNi7-10), the widely acknowledged Johnson–Cook material model is implemented using compression and Vickers indenter tests to define the necessary parameters. The fracture locus implementation is also based on the Johnson–Cook method and an axial shift of the fracture locus based on the hardness profile of the spur gears is determined by quasi-static pulsator tests. For validation, a project-specific gearbox test rig is used, enabling consistent ingestion of defined fragments. In addition, to check the likelihood of a tooth flank crack and to validate the results, a simplified ingestion experiment is performed.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper deals with the analysis of TRIP steel HCT690 deformation behaviour. The mechanical properties and deformation characteristics of the tested material are determined using selected material tests and tests that consider the required stress states used to define the yield criterion boundary condition and subsequent deformation behaviour in the region of severe plastic deformation. The measured data are subsequently implemented in the numerical simulation of sheet metal forming, where they are used as input data for the computational process in the form of a selected material model defining the yield criterion boundary and, furthermore, the material hardening law during deformation of the material. The chosen numerical simulation process corresponds to the sheet metal forming process, including the subsequent spring-back of the material, when the force does not affect the material. Furthermore, the influence of the chosen computational model and selected process parameters on the deformation and spring-back process of the material is evaluated. In addition to that, at the end of the paper, the results from the numerical simulation are compared with experimentally produced sheet stamping.},

ABSTRACT = {We investigate the transmittance spectrum of a multichannel filter composed of dielectric (A) and plasma (P) materials in the microwave region within the transfer matrix formalism. Two configurations of the proposed filter are studied under the influence of an applied magnetic field: (1) a periodic structure containing (A/P)N unit cells surrounded by air and (2) the introduction of a second dielectric material (D) acting as a defect layer to produce an (AP)N/2/D/(AP)N/2 structure. Our findings reveal that in the periodic case, the number of resonant states of the transmittance increases with number N; however, the observed blue and red shifts depend on the intensity and orientation of the applied magnetic field. We present contour plots of the transmission coefficients that show the effect of the incident angle on the shifts of the photonic band gaps. Furthermore, we find that the introduction of a defect layer generates additional resonant states and merges the central resonant peak into a miniband of resonances. Moreover, we show that the number of resonant peaks and their locations can be modulated by increasing the unit cell number, N, as well as increasing the width of the inserted defect layer. Our proposed structures enable the design of novel photonic filters using magnetized plasma materials operating in the microwave region.},

ABSTRACT = {The manuscript presents an efficient semi-analytical solution with three-dimensional capabilities for the evaluation of the static response of laminated curved structures subjected to general external loads. A two-dimensional model is presented based on the Equivalent Single Layer (ESL) approach, where the displacement field components are described with a generalized formulation based on a higher-order expansion along the thickness direction. The fundamental equations are derived from the Hamiltonian principle, and the solution is found by means of Navier’s approach. Then, an efficient recovery procedure, derived from the three-dimensional elasticity equations and based on the Generalized Differential Quadrature (GDQ) method, is adopted for the derivation of the three-dimensional solution. Some examples of investigation are presented, where the numerical predictions of refined three-dimensional Finite-Element-based models are matched with a high level of accuracy. The model is validated for both straight and curved panels, taking into account different lamination schemes and load shapes. Furthermore, it is shown that the numerical solution to the elasticity problem in the recovery procedure is determining and accurately predicting the three-dimensional static response of the doubly-curved shell solid.},

ABSTRACT = {In natural kaolinite lattices, Al3+ can potentially be substituted by cations such as Mg2+, Ca2+, and Fe3+, thereby influencing its adsorption characteristics towards rare earth elements like Sc3+. Density functional theory (DFT) has emerged as a crucial tool in the study of adsorption phenomena, particularly for understanding the complex interactions of rare earth elements with clay minerals. This study employed DFT to investigate the impact of these three dopant elements on the adsorption of hydrated Sc3+ on the kaolinite (001) Al-OH surface. We discerned that the optimal adsorption configuration for hydrated Sc3+ is Sc(H2O)83+, with a preference for adsorption at the deprotonated Ou sites. Among the dopants, Mg doping exhibited superior stability with a binding energy of −4.311 eV and the most negative adsorption energy of −1104.16 kJ/mol. Both Mg and Ca doping enhanced the covalency of the Al-O bond, leading to a subtle shift in the overall density of states towards higher energies, thereby augmenting the reactivity of the O atoms. In contrast, Fe doping caused a pronounced shift in the density of states towards lower energies. Compared to the undoped kaolinite, Mg and Ca doping further diminished the adsorption energy of hydrated Sc3+ and increased its coordination number, while Fe doping elevated the adsorption energy. This study offers profound insights into understanding the role of dopant elements in the adsorption of hydrated Sc3+ on kaolinite.},

ABSTRACT = {Fatigue life testing is a complex and costly matter, especially in the case of fibre-reinforced thermoplastics, where other parameters in addition to force alone must be taken into account. The number of tests required therefore increases significantly, especially if the influence of different fibre orientations is to be taken into account. It is therefore important to gain the greatest possible amount of knowledge from the limited number of available tests. In order to achieve this, this study aims to utilise adaptive sampling, which is used in numerous areas of computational engineering, for the design of experiments on fatigue life testing. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are therefore trained on data for the short-fibre-reinforced material PBT GF30, and their areas of greatest model uncertainty are queried. This was undertaken with ANNs from various numbers of hidden layers, which were analysed for their performance. The ideal case turned out to be four hidden layers, for which a squared error as small as 1 × 10−3 was recorded. Locally resolved, the ANN was used to identify the region of greatest uncertainty for samples of vertical orientation and small numbers of cycles. With information such as this, additional data can be obtained in such uncertain regions in order to improve the model prediction—almost halving the recorded error to only 0.55 × 10−3. In this way, a model of comparable value can be found with less experimental effort, or a model of better quality can be set up with the same experimental effort.},

ABSTRACT = {A method of internal pressure–temperature coupling analysis for the thermal decomposition of GFRP composites under high-temperature conditions was established, which incorporates coupled calculations of heat transfer equations, the Arrhenius equation, Darcy’s law, and the ideal gas state equation. Using the overlapping mesh method, the coupling calculation of temperature and internal pressure is realized based on the UMATHT and USDFLD user subroutines developed. Specifically, two user subroutines, UMATHT-1 and UMATHT-2, are used to define the heat transfer equation and gas diffusion equation separately. Numerical simulations are conducted to simulate the polymers’ thermal decomposition in high-temperature environments. For glass fiber/vinyl ester composites and glass fiber/phenolic composites, the predicted temperature and pressure values are in good agreement with experimental measurements, and porosity and permeability are then analyzed. Due to the accumulation of thermal decomposition gases, inter-pressure within the material surged and reached a peak value. After that, it began to decrease, but the factors affecting the pressure decrease vary at different positions. Specifically, the pressure closest to the heating surface is influenced by the combined effects of decomposition rate, permeability, and porosity, while the pressure far away from the heating surface is only affected by the initial permeability. The pressure in the intermediate region may be influenced by both increased porosity and initial permeability.},

ABSTRACT = {Fatigue fractures in materials are the main cause of approximately 80% of all material failures, and it is believed that such failures can be predicted and mathematically calculated in a reliable manner. It is possible to establish prediction modalities in cases of fatigue fractures according to three fundamental variables in fatigue, such as volume, number of fracture cycles, as well as applied stress, with the integration of Weibull constants (length characteristic). In this investigation, mechanical fatigue tests were carried out on specimens smaller than 4 mm2, made of different industrial materials. Their subsequent analysis was performed through precision computed tomography, in search for microfractures. The measurement of these microfractures, along with their metrics and classifications, was recorded. A convolutional neural network trained with deep learning was used to achieve the detection of microfractures in image processing. The detection of microfractures in images with resolutions of 480 × 854 or 960 × 960 pixels is the primary objective of this network, and its accuracy is above 95%. Images that have microfractures and those without are classified using the network. Subsequently, by means of image processing, the microfracture is isolated. Finally, the images containing this feature are interpreted using image processing to obtain their area, perimeter, characteristic length, circularity, orientation, and microfracture-type metrics. All values are obtained in pixels and converted to metric units (μm) through a conversion factor based on image resolution. The growth of microfractures will be used to define trends in the development of fatigue fractures through the studies presented.},

ABSTRACT = {Rotary friction welding is one of the most crucial techniques for joining different parts in advanced industries. Experimentally measuring the history of thermomechanical and microstructural parameters of this process can be a significant challenge and incurs high costs. To address these challenges, the finite element method was used to simulate thermomechanical and microstructural aspects of the welding of identical superalloy Inconel 718 tubes. Numerical simulation results were used to compute essential mechanical and metallurgical parameters such as temperature, strain, strain rate, volume fraction of dynamic recrystallization, and grain size distribution. These parameters were subsequently verified using experimental test results. The Johnson–Avrami model was utilized in the microstructural simulation to convert thermomechanical parameters into metallurgical factors, employing a FORTRAN subroutine. The calculated thickness of the recrystallization zone in the wall was 480 and 850 μm at the tube wall’s center and edge, respectively. These values were reported from experimental measurements as 500 and 800 μm, respectively. The predicted grain size changes from the center to the edge of the wall thickness, near the weld interface, ranged from 2.07 to 2.15 μm, comparable to the experimental measurements ranging from 1.9 to 2.2 μm. Various curves are also presented to explore the correlation between thermomechanical and microstructural parameters, with the experimental results revealing predictable microstructure evolutions correlated with thermomechanical changes.},

ABSTRACT = {This study aims to investigate the effect of hot deformation on commercially available Ti-6246 alloy below its β-transus transition temperature at 900 °C, knowing that the α → β transition temperature of Ti-6246 alloy is about 935 °C. The study systematically applies a thermomechanical processing cycle, including hot rolling at 900 °C and solution and ageing treatments at various temperatures, to investigate microstructural and mechanical alterations. The solution treatments are performed at temperatures of 800 °C, 900 °C and 1000 °C, i.e., below and above the β-transus transition temperature, for 9 min, followed by oil quenching. The ageing treatment is performed at 600 °C for 6 h, followed by air quenching. Employing various techniques, such as X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, optical microscopy, tensile strength and microhardness testing, the research identifies crucial changes in the alloy’s constituent phases and morphology during thermomechanical processing. In solution treatment conditions, it was found that at temperatures of 800 °C and 900 °C, the α′-Ti martensite phase was generated in the primary α-Ti phase according to Burger’s relation, but the recrystallization process was preferred at a temperature of 900 °C, while at a temperature of 1000 °C, the α″-Ti martensite phase was generated in the primary β-Ti phase according to Burger’s relation. The ageing treatment conditions cause the α′-Ti/α″-Ti martensite phases to revert to their α-Ti/β-Ti primary phases. The mechanical properties, in terms of strength and ductility, underwent an important beneficial evolution when applying solution treatment, followed by ageing treatment, which provided an optimal mixture of strength and ductility. This paper provides engineers with the opportunity to understand the mechanical performance of Ti-6246 alloy under applied stresses and to improve its applications by designing highly efficient components, particularly military engine components, ultimately contributing to advances in technology and materials science.},

ABSTRACT = {Fine-grained soils present engineering challenges. Stabilization with marble powder has shown promise for improving engineering properties. Understanding the temporal evolution of Unconfined Compressive Strength (UCS) and geotechnical properties in stabilized soils could aid strength assessment. This study investigates the stabilization of fine-grained clayey soils using waste marble powder as an alternative binder. Laboratory experiments were conducted to evaluate the geotechnical properties of soil–marble powder mixtures, including Atterberg’s limits, compaction characteristics, California Bearing Ratio (CBR), Indirect Tensile Strength (ITS), and Unconfined Compressive Strength (UCS). The effects of various factors, such as curing time, molding water content, and composition ratios, on UCS, were analyzed using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques, including histograms, box plots, and statistical modeling. The results show that the CBR increased from 10.43 to 22.94% for unsoaked and 4.68 to 12.46% for soaked conditions with 60% marble powder, ITS rose from 100 to 208 kN/m2 with 60–75% marble powder, and UCS rose from 170 to 661 kN/m2 after 28 days of curing, molding water content (optimum at 22.5%), and composition ratios (optimum at 60% marble powder). Complex modeling yielded R2 (0.954) and RMSE (29.82 kN/m2) between predicted and experimental values. This study demonstrates the potential of utilizing waste marble powder as a sustainable and cost-effective binder for soil stabilization, transforming weak soils into viable construction materials.},

ABSTRACT = {An additional crossover of viscous flow in liquids occurs at a temperature Tvm above the known non-Arrhenius to Arrhenius crossover temperature (TA). Tvm is the temperature when the minimum possible viscosity value ηmin is attained, and the flow becomes non-activated with a further increase in temperature. Explicit equations are proposed for the assessments of both Tvm and ηmin, which are shown to provide data that are close to those experimentally measured. Numerical estimations reveal that the new crossover temperature is very high and can barely be achieved in practical uses, although at temperatures close to it, the contribution of the non-activated regime of the flow can be accounted for.},

ABSTRACT = {The initial melting quality of a high-speed laser cladding layer has an important impact on its post-treatment and practical application. In this study, based on the repair of hydraulic support columns of coal mining machines, the influence of high-speed laser cladding process parameters on the quality of Fe-Cr-Ni alloy coatings was investigated to realize the accurate prediction of coating quality. The Taguchi orthogonal method was used to design the L25(56) test. The prediction models of the relationship between the cladding process and the coating quality were established using the Random Forest (RF) and AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting, AB) algorithms, respectively. Then, the prediction accuracy of the two models was compared, and the process parameter features were screened for importance evaluation. The results show that the AB prediction model is more accurate than the RF prediction model and more sensitive to abnormal data. The importance evaluation based on the AdaBoost model shows that the scanning speed has a great influence on the height and surface roughness of the coating. On the other hand, the overlap rate is the most important factor in controlling the dilution ratio and near-surface grain size of high-speed laser melting coatings. In addition, the micro-hardness of the coating and the thermal effect of the substrate can be effectively enhanced by adjusting the laser power and scanning speed. Finally, it was verified that the AB prediction model could accurately estimate the quality indexes of the coating with a prediction error less than 6%. The results show that it is feasible to predict the quality of high-speed laser cladding with the AB algorithm. It provides a basis for the adjustment of process parameters in the subsequent quality control process of cladding.},

ABSTRACT = {The elasticity matrix and the coefficients of thermal expansion (CTEs) of 8-harness satin-woven (8HS) carbon-fiber-reinforced carbon matrix (C/C) composites at high temperatures were obtained by the asymptotic homogenization method (AHM) and finite element method (FEM). By analyzing the microstructure of the 8HS C/C composites, a representative volume element (RVE) model considering a braided structure was established. The effects of the temperature and component volume fraction on the elasticity matrix and CTEs of the composites were investigated. The sensitivity of model parameters, including the size of RVE model and mesh sensitivity, were studied. The optimal calculation model was employed. In addition, the effects of the 4HS methods and 8HS methods on the elastic constants of the composites were compared. The temperature and variation in the carbon fiber volume fraction were found to have a significant impact on the elasticity matrix and CTEs of composite materials. At the same volume fraction of carbon fibers, some elastic coefficients of the 4HS composite material were slightly lower than those of 8HS composite material. This research affords a computational strategy for the accurate prediction of the themo-mechanical properties of satin-woven C/C composites.},

ABSTRACT = {This work presents a test rig developed for testing the lifetime of electrically and cyclically activated shape memory alloy wires. This test rig is developed to provide information on the functional and structural fatigue of the wires. Therefore, electrical activation on the test rig can be carried out using different activation profiles, because it is of great research interest to determine whether those profiles have a significant influence on the wire’s lifetime and functional behavior. The test rig monitors the process parameters such as stroke, current, voltage, and force. After presenting the electrical and mechanical design of the test rig, this publication evaluates an initial series of tests to demonstrate its functionality. Three different activation profiles are run in parallel on four identical test rig setups and are then evaluated. The functionality of the test rig is verified by a detailed evaluation of the process data on the one hand, and by comparing the results with existing literature on the other. The functionality of the test rig can thus be verified. At the same time, the strong influence of the different activation profiles on both the lifetime and the functional properties of the shape memory alloy wires becomes clear.},

ABSTRACT = {Changing the metallic card clothing on a carding machine is costly when the spinning mills want to card different fibers from cotton to terylene or vice versa. This article proposes a newly developed cylinder card clothing compatible with cotton and terylene fibers by Nb alloying of AISI 1090 steel so that the spinning mills can change the type of fiber without changing the card clothing. Based on an idea developed from classical carding balance theory to study the adaptability of the cylinder card clothing for cotton and terylene fibers, the wall shear stress was used as the basis for compatibility analysis of carding behavior and bearing capacity with cotton and terylene fibers and as the focus of this study. Nb alloying of AISI 1090 steel showed good wear resistance in carding areas after heat treatment with high hardness above 840 Hv0.2 and extremely fine grain grade of 13.5 class, which increased about 25% compared to conventional 80 WV. The testing results in the spinning mills, including one cotton and two terylene fibers, showed good performance with this newly developed card clothing. In conclusion, the card clothing made of Nb alloying of AISI 1090 steel can handle different fibers with acceptable carding performance.},

ABSTRACT = {The goal of this paper is to improve the mechanical strength-to-weight ratios of metal cubic lattice structures using unit cells with fillet shapes inspired by triply periodic minimal surfaces (TPMS). The lattice structures here presented were fabricated from AA6082 aluminum alloy using lost-PLA processing. Static and dynamic flat and wedge compression tests were conducted on samples with varying fillet shapes and fill factors. Finite element method simulations followed the static tests to compare numerical predictions with experimental outcomes, revealing a good agreement. The TPSM-type fillet shape induces a triaxial stress state that significantly improves the mechanical strength-to-weight ratio compared to fillet radius-free lattices, which was also confirmed by analytical considerations. Dynamic tests exhibited high resistance to flat impacts, while wedge impacts, involving a high concentrated-load, brought out an increased sensitivity to strain rates with a short plastic deformation followed by abrupt fragmentation, indicating a shift towards brittle behavior.},

ABSTRACT = {The aim of the current study was to determine the load capacity of composite columns subjected to axial compressive load. The subjects of the study were two types of columns with a rectangular cross-section, with different edge lengths. The tested columns had a closed cross-section. Four different fiber arrangements were analyzed for both cross-sections studied. The research was realized using interdisciplinary methods to determine the mechanism of damage to the composite material, with particular emphasis on damage initiation and propagation. Experimental tests were realized on a testing machine, the analysis was carried out with an acoustic emission system, and image analysis using visual assessment system of deflections of the walls of the structure. In addition, a number of numerical analyses were realized based on advanced modeling techniques for fiber-reinforced composites. A comparative analysis of both quantitative and qualitative results is presented for both analyses. The innovation of the presented research lies in the development of a custom method for modeling structures made of composite material with special emphasis on the failure phase. This will allow to accurately reflect the modeling of thin-walled structures with closed cross-section subjected to loading in a complex stress state.},

ABSTRACT = {The aggregation-induced emission (AIE) effect exhibits a significant influence on the development of luminescent materials and has made remarkable progress over the past decades. The advancement of high-performance AIE materials requires fast and accurate predictions of their photophysical properties, which is impeded by the inherent limitations of quantum chemical calculations. In this work, we present an accurate machine learning approach for the fast predictions of quantum yields and wavelengths to screen out AIE molecules. A database of about 563 organic luminescent molecules with quantum yields and wavelengths in the monomeric/aggregated states was established. Individual/combined molecular fingerprints were selected and compared elaborately to attain appropriate molecular descriptors. Different machine learning algorithms combined with favorable molecular fingerprints were further screened to achieve more accurate prediction models. The simulation results indicate that combined molecular fingerprints yield more accurate predictions in the aggregated states, and random forest and gradient boosting regression algorithms show the best predictions in quantum yields and wavelengths, respectively. Given the successful applications of machine learning in quantum yields and wavelengths, it is reasonable to anticipate that machine learning can serve as a complementary strategy to traditional experimental/theoretical methods in the investigation of aggregation-induced luminescent molecules to facilitate the discovery of luminescent materials.},

ABSTRACT = {Advances in high-pressure grinding roll (HGPR) technology since its first commercial application in the cement industry include new roll wear protection techniques and new confinement systems. The latter contribute to reductions in the edge effects in an attempt to reach a more homogenous product size along the rolls. Additional advances in this technology have been made in recent years, while modeling and simulation tools are also reaching maturity and can now be used to subject such novel developments to detailed scrutiny. This work applies a hybrid approach combining advanced simulations using the discrete element method, the particle replacement model and multibody dynamics to a phenomenological population balance model to critically assess two recent advances in HPGR technology: spring-loaded cheek plates and the offset roller press. Force and torque controllers, included in the EDEM 2022.1 software, were used to describe the responses of the geometries in contact with the granular material processed. Simulations showed that while the former successfully reduced the lateral bypass of the material by as much as 65% when cheek plates became severely worn, the latter demonstrated lower throughput and higher potential wear but an ability to generate a finer product than the traditional design.},

ABSTRACT = {Recently, researchers have focused on improving motor performance and efficiency. To manufacture motors with performance and efficiency higher than those of motors manufactured through the additive process, compressibility verification through the parameter control of soft magnetic composites (SMCs) is essential. To this end, this study aims to select suitable powders for manufacturing high-performance, high-efficiency motors by exploring powder mixing ratios and milling times. Through physical property tests, the optimal mixing ratio is predicted using the Multi-Particle Finite Element Method (MPFEM) and powder compression molding analysis, and compressibility is predicted in view of the influence of a change in particle size as a function of the powder mixing ratio and milling time. In addition, based on the result of a comparative analysis of density through experiments and an analysis of internal defects through SEM, a 50:50 mixing ratio of hybrid atomizing and gas atomizing powders milled for 3 h provided the best compressibility. Therefore, the use of SMC cores fabricated using powder compression molding is expected to improve motor performance and efficiency.},

Furthermore, new examples are discussed in order to illustrate that significant differences exist in the responses predicted by boundary tractions with and without acceleration terms.},

ABSTRACT = {Selective laser sintering (SLS) is one of the most well-regarded additive manufacturing (AM) sub-processes, whose popularity has been increasing among numerous critical and demanding industries due to its capabilities, mainly manufacturing parts with highly complex geometries and desirable mechanical properties, with potential to replace other, more expensive, conventional processes. However, due to its various underlying multi-physics phenomena, the intrinsic complexity of the SLS process often hampers its industrial implementation. Such limitation has motivated academic interest in obtaining better insights into the process to optimize it and attain the required standards. In that regard, the usual experimental optimization methods are time-consuming and expensive and can fail to provide the optimal configurations, leading researchers to resort to computational modeling to better understand the process. The main objective of the present work is to develop a computational model capable of simulating the SLS process for polymeric applications, within an open-source framework, at a particle-length scale to assess the main process parameters’ impact. Following previous developments, virgin and used polymer granules with different viscosities are implemented to better represent the actual process feedstock. The results obtained agree with the available experimental data, leading to a powerful tool to study, in greater detail, the SLS process and its physical parameters and material properties, contributing to its optimization.},

ABSTRACT = {The Hazelett continuous casting and rolling process represents a leading-edge production method for cold-rolled aluminum sheet and strip billets in the world. Its solidification microstructure significantly influences the quality of billets produced for cold rolling of aluminum sheets and strips. In this study, employing the CAFE (Cellular Automaton—Finite Element) method, we developed a coupled computational model to simulate the solidification microstructure in the Hazelett continuous casting process. We investigated the impact of nucleation parameters, casting temperature, and continuous casting speed on the microstructural evolution of the continuous casting billet. Through integrated metallographic analyses, we aimed to elucidate the controlling mechanisms underlying the Hazelett continuous casting process and its resultant microstructure. The results demonstrate that the equiaxed rate of grains increases with an increase in nucleation density, and the grain size decreases under constant cooling strength. With other nucleation parameters held constant, the grain size decreases as undercooling increases, and the columnar crystal zone expands. The nucleation density of the Hazelett continuous casting aluminum alloy has been determined to range between 1011 m−3 and 1013 m−3, and the undercooling ranges between 1 °C and 2.5 °C. The solidified grain structure can be controlled between 35 μm and 72 μm. The grain size of the continuous casting billet increases with an increase in pouring temperature and decreases as the casting speed increases. Elevating the pouring temperature positively impacts the fraction of high-angle grain boundaries and promotes the dendritic to equiaxed grain transition. Moreover, there exists potential for further optimization of continuous casting process parameters.},

ABSTRACT = {This study investigates the thermal stress and bolt load distribution in a hybrid panel structure of an aircraft mechanical joint under extreme temperatures. The hybrid panel structure comprises two aluminum alloy splices, six T-shaped composite stringers, and two composite skins, secured together with 96 bolts. This study analyzed the strain induced by thermal stress on composite materials and metals within the structure across temperatures, employing temperature environment tests ranging from room temperature to −54 °C, alongside a carrying capacity test at −54 °C. Furthermore, a three-dimensional simulation model of the panel structure was developed, incorporating considerations for contact, metal elastoplasticity, and the progressive damage failure of composite materials. This model facilitated the determination of thermal stress and bolt load distribution patterns. The results indicate a strong consistency between the finite element analysis outcomes and the experimental data. Temperature variations exacerbate the uneven distribution of bolt loads, concentrating the load near the edges of the hybrid structure while diminishing it in the center. The bolt load distribution parallel to the mechanical load direction forms an “M” shape, with a maximum load magnitude of approximately 31 kN. Perpendicular to the mechanical load, the bolt load undergoes significant changes, especially at the edges, reaching a maximum of about 20 kN, which warrants attention. The bolt-load distribution of the structure with the increase in mechanical load at −54 °C tends to be consistent with that at room temperature.},

ABSTRACT = {Selective laser melting (SLM) forms specimens that often exhibit anisotropic mechanical properties. Most existing research only explains that the mechanical properties of specimens perpendicular to the build direction are superior to those parallel to the build direction. In this paper, the mechanical properties of SLM 316L SS specimens with different surfaces and different directions are compared. Finally, it was found that the mechanical properties of specimens on Face 3 are stronger than those on Face 1 and Face 2, while the mechanical properties of specimens on Face 1 and Face 2 are similar. For specimens in different directions on the same surface, the mechanical properties of Face 1 and Face 2 exhibit clear anisotropy, while the mechanical properties of Face 3 tend to be isotropic. In this paper, the EBSD technique was used to analyze the specimens. It was found that the anisotropy of the mechanical properties of Face 1 and Face 2 are attributed to the presence of texture and columnar crystals in the sample. This paper can provide accurate and reliable material performance data for the practical application of SLM 316L SS, thereby guiding the optimization of engineering design and manufacturing processes.},

ABSTRACT = {Modular hobs are tools with very complex geometry. Regardless of the material of the gear wheels, they determine the accuracy of the gears made in the hobbing machining process. Gears are made of various, often innovative materials depending on the requirements. Sometimes, the materials are characterised by very high hardness (over 65 HRC). The mathematical basis for describing the faces of a hob presented in the article allows for modifying the rack profile shaping the gear wheel’s teeth. The model’s universality makes it possible to perform numerical simulations of the influence of individual parameters of the hob creation process (geometry of the grinding wheels and their setting in the shaping process) on the profile of the rake and flank surfaces. The cutting edge (rack edge) is the locus of points belonging to both of these surfaces and thus directly impacts the accuracy of the gear wheel that is shaped in the hobbing process. The article summarises the authors’ long-term cooperation with the industry, resulting in a series of articles devoted to hobs. The issues presented in the article are significant to the machinery industry and hob manufacturers.},

ABSTRACT = {With the rapid development of the new energy vehicle market, the demand for extruded profiles for battery trays, mainly characterized by significant wall thickness differences in multiple chambers, is increasing, posing new challenges to production and quality control. This study examines the multi-objective optimization problem in the design process of aluminum profile dies with multi-cavity profiles and significant wall thickness differences. Using QFORM-extrusion professional aluminum extrusion finite element analysis software and the response surface analysis method, the standard deviation of the velocity (SDV), standard deviation of the pressure (SDP), and thick wall hydrostatic pressure (TWHP) on the profile section at the die exit are optimized. By analyzing the functional relationship between the key die structure parameters (the height of the baffle plates, the length of the bearing, and the height of the false mandrel) and the optimization objective, the optimal combination scheme of die structure parameters was obtained using the NSGA2 (non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-2) multi-objective genetic optimization algorithm. The results show that, compared with the initial design scheme, the standard deviation of profile section velocity was reduced by 5.33%, the standard deviation of pressure was reduced by 11.16%, and the thick wall hydrostatic pressure was increased by 26.47%. The die designed and manufactured using this scheme successfully completed the hot extrusion production task, and the profile quality met the predetermined requirements, thus verifying the effectiveness of this study in optimizing the design of a multi-cavity aluminum profile die with significant differences in wall thickness for complex structures.},

ABSTRACT = {The rapid development of additive manufacturing (AM) has facilitated the creation of bionic lightweight, energy-absorbing structures, enabling the implementation of more sophisticated internal structural designs. For protective structures, the utilization of artificially controlled deformation patterns can effectively reduce uncertainties arising from random structural damage and enhance deformation stability. This paper proposed a bionic corrugated lightweight honeycomb structure with controllable deformation. The force on the onset state of deformation of the overall structure was investigated, and the possibility of controlled deformation in the homogeneous structure was compared with that in the corrugated structure. The corrugated structures exhibited a second load-bearing capacity wave peak, with the load-bearing capacity reaching 60.7% to 117.29% of the first load-bearing peak. The damage morphology of the corrugated structure still maintained relative integrity. In terms of energy absorption capacity, the corrugated lightweight structure has a much stronger energy absorption capacity than the homogeneous structure due to the second peak of the load carrying capacity. The findings of this study suggested that the combination of geometric customization and longitudinal corrugation through additive manufacturing offers a promising approach for the development of high-performance energy-absorbing structures.},

ABSTRACT = {The primary focus of the current paper centers on the microstructures and mechanical properties exhibited by a Ti-30Nb-12Zr-5Ta-2Sn-1.25Fe (wt. %) (TNZTSF) alloy that has been produced through an intricate synthesis process comprising cold-crucible induction in levitation, carried out in an atmosphere controlled by argon, and cold-rolling deformation (CR), applying systematic adjustments in the total deformation degree (total applied thickness reduction), spanning from 10% to 60%. The microstructural characteristics of the processed specimens were investigated by SEM and XRD techniques, and the mechanical properties by tensile and microhardness testing. The collected data indicate that the TNZTSF alloy’s microstructure, in the as-received condition, consists of a β-Ti phase, which shows polyhedral equiaxed grains with an average grain size close to 82.5 µm. During the cold-deformation processing, the microstructure accommodates the increased applied deformation degree by increasing crystal defects such as sub-grain boundaries, dislocation cells, dislocation lines, and other crystal defects, powerfully affecting the morphological characteristics. The as-received TNZTSF alloy showed both high strength (i.e., ultimate tensile strength close to σUTS = 705.6 MPa) and high ductility (i.e., elongation to fracture close to εf = 11.1%) properties, and the computed β-Ti phase had the lattice parameter a = 3.304(7) Å and the average lattice microstrain ε = 0.101(3)%, which are drastically influenced by the applied cold deformation, increasing the strength properties and decreasing the ductility properties due to the increased crystal defects density. Applying a deformation degree close to 60% leads to an ultimate tensile strength close to σUTS = 1192.1 MPa, an elongation to fracture close to εf = 7.9%, and an elastic modulus close to 54.9 GPa, while the computed β-Ti phase lattice parameter becomes a = 3.302(1) Å.},

ABSTRACT = {Cavitation in micro-scale lubricating film could be determined by the fluid’s thermal properties, which impacts the hydrodynamic lubrication capacity dramatically. This study aimed to novelly investigate the impact of the thermal cavitation effect on the hydrodynamic performance of liquid face seals, employing the compressible cavitation model, viscosity–temperature effect, and energy equation. The finite difference method was adopted to analyze the thermal cavitation by calculating the pressure and temperature profiles of the lubricating film. The working conditions and geometric configuration of liquid face seals under different thermal cases were further studied to explore their effects on sealing performance. The results showed that thermal cavitation could reduce the temperature difference of liquid film at high speeds, and cavitation would be weakened under temperature gradients, which further dropped off the hydrodynamic performance. Contrary to the leakage rate, the opening forces tended to be lower with the increasing seal pressure and film thickness under high-temperature gradients. Furthermore, apart from the spiral angle of grooves, the hydrodynamic performance exhibited significant variation with increasing groove depth, number, and radius at high-temperature gradients, which meant that the thermal cavitation effect should be considered in the design of geometric grooves to obtain better hydrodynamic performance.},

ABSTRACT = {With additive manufacturing (AM) processes such as Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing (WAAM), components with complex shapes or with functional properties can be produced, with advantages in the areas of resource conservation, lightweight construction, and load-optimized production. However, proving component quality is a challenge because it is not possible to produce 100% defect-free components. In addition to this, statistically determined fluctuations in the wire quality, gas flow, and their interaction with process parameters result in a quality of the components that is not 100% reproducible. Complex testing procedures are therefore required to demonstrate the quality of the components, which are not cost-effective and lead to less efficiency. As part of the project “3DPrintFEM”, a sound emission analysis is used to evaluate the quality of AM components. Within the scope of the project, an approach was being developed to determine the quality of an AM part dependent not necessarily on its geometry. Samples were produced from WAAM, which were later cut and milled to precision. To determine the frequencies, the samples were put through a resonant frequency test (RFM). The unwanted modes were then removed from the spectrum produced by the experiments by comparing it with FEM simulations. Later, defects were introduced in experimental samples in compliance with the ISO 5817 guidelines. In order to create a database of frequencies related to the degree of the sample defect, they were subjected to RFM. The database was further augmented through frequencies from simulations performed on samples with similar geometries, and, hence, a training set was generated for an algorithm. A machine-learning algorithm based on regression modelling was trained based on the database to sort samples according to the degree of flaws in them. The algorithm’s detectability was evaluated using samples that had a known level of flaws which forms the test dataset. Based on the outcome, the algorithm will be integrated into an equipment developed in-house to monitor the quality of samples produced, thereby having an in-house quality assessment routine. The equipment shall be less expensive than conventional acoustic equipment, thus helping the industry cut costs when validating the quality of their components.},
