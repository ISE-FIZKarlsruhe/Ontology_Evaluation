Tribological properties of engineering components are a key issue due to their effect on the operational performance factors such as wear, surface characteristics, service life and in situ behavior. Thus, for better component quality, process parameters have major importance, especially for metal matrix composites (MMCs), which are a special class of materials used in a wide range of engineering applications including but not limited to structural, automotive and aeronautics. This paper deals with the tribological behavior of Cu-B-CrC composites (Cu-main matrix, B-CrC-reinforcement by 0, 2.5, 5 and 7.5 wt.%). The tribological characteristics investigated in this study are the coefficient of friction, wear rate and weight loss. For this purpose, four levels of sliding distance (1000, 1500, 2000 and 2500 m) and four levels of applied load (10, 15, 20 and 25 N) were used. In addition, two levels of sliding velocity (1 and 1.5 m/s), two levels of sintering time (1 and 2 h) and two sintering temperatures (1000 and 1050 °C) were used. Taguchi’s L16 orthogonal array was used to statistically analyze the aforementioned input parameters and to determine their best levels which give the desired values for the analyzed tribological characteristics. The results were analyzed by statistical analysis, optimization and 3D surface plots. Accordingly, it was determined that the most effective factor for wear rate, weight loss and friction coefficients is the contribution rate. According to signal-to-noise ratios, optimum solutions can be sorted as: the highest levels of parameters except for applied load and reinforcement ratio (2500 m, 10 N, 1.5 m/s, 2 h, 1050 °C and 0 wt.%) for wear rate, certain levels of all parameters (1000 m, 10 N, 1.5 m/s, 2 h, 1050 °C and 2.5 wt.%) for weight loss and 1000 m, 15 N, 1 m/s, 1 h, 1000 °C and 0 wt.% for the coefficient of friction. The comprehensive analysis of findings has practical significance and provides valuable information for a composite material from the production phase to the actual working conditions.
