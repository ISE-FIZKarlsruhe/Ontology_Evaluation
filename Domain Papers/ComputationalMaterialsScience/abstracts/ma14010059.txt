Sulfuric acid under different concentrations and with the addition of SO3 (fuming sulfuric acid) was studied as a reducing agent for the production of reduced graphene oxide (RGO). Three concentrations of sulfuric acid (1.5, 5, and 12 M), as well as 12 M with 30% SO3, were used. The reduction of graphene oxide increased with H2SO4 concentration as observed by Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. It was observed that GO lost primarily epoxide functional groups from 40.4 to 9.7% and obtaining 69.8% carbon when using 12 M H2SO4, without leaving sulfur doping. Additionally, the appearance of hexagonal domain structures observed in transmission electron microscopy and analyzed by selected area electron diffraction patterns confirmed the improvement in graphitization. Although the addition of SO3 in H2SO4 improved the GO reduction with 74% carbon, as measured by XPS, the use of SO3 introduced sulfur doping of 1.3%. RGO produced with sulfuric acid was compared with a sample obtained via ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, a very common reduction route, by observing that the RGO produced with sulfuric acid had a higher C/O ratio than the material reduced by UV irradiation. This work showed that sulfuric acid can be used as a single-step reducing agent for RGO without sulfur contamination.
