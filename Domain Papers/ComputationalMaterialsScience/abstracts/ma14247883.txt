This article studied the effects of pin angle on heat generation and temperature distribution during friction stir welding (FSW) of AA1100 aluminum alloy and St-14 low carbon steel. A validated computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model was implemented to simulate the FSW process. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was employed in order to investigate internal materialsâ€™ flow. Simulation results revealed that the mechanical work on the joint line increased with the pin angle and larger stir zone forms. The simulation results show that in the angled pin tool, more than 26% of the total heat is produced by the pin. Meanwhile, in other cases, the total heat produced by the pin was near 15% of the total generated heat. The thermo-mechanical cycle in the steel zone increased, and consequently, mechanical interlock between base metals increased. The simulation output demonstrated that the frictional heat generation with a tool without a pin angle is higher than an angled pin. The calculation result also shows that the maximum heat was generated on the steel side.
