Recently, researchers have focused on improving motor performance and efficiency. To manufacture motors with performance and efficiency higher than those of motors manufactured through the additive process, compressibility verification through the parameter control of soft magnetic composites (SMCs) is essential. To this end, this study aims to select suitable powders for manufacturing high-performance, high-efficiency motors by exploring powder mixing ratios and milling times. Through physical property tests, the optimal mixing ratio is predicted using the Multi-Particle Finite Element Method (MPFEM) and powder compression molding analysis, and compressibility is predicted in view of the influence of a change in particle size as a function of the powder mixing ratio and milling time. In addition, based on the result of a comparative analysis of density through experiments and an analysis of internal defects through SEM, a 50:50 mixing ratio of hybrid atomizing and gas atomizing powders milled for 3 h provided the best compressibility. Therefore, the use of SMC cores fabricated using powder compression molding is expected to improve motor performance and efficiency.
