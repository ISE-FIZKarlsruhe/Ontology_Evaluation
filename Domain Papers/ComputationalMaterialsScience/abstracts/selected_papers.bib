 abstract = {We investigate 29Si nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) chemical shifts, δiso, of silicon nitride. Our goal is to relate the local structure to the NMR signal and, thus, provide the means to extract more information from the experimental 29Si NMR spectra in this family of compounds. We apply structural modeling and the gauge-included projector augmented wave (GIPAW) method within density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Our models comprise known and hypothetical crystalline Si3N4, as well as amorphous Si3N4 structures. We find good agreement with available experimental 29Si NMR data for tetrahedral Si[4] and octahedral Si[6] in crystalline Si3N4, predict the chemical shift of a trigonal-bipyramidal Si[5] to be about −120 ppm, and quantify the impact of Si-N bond lengths on 29Si δiso. We show through computations that experimental 29Si NMR data indicates that silicon dicarbodiimide, Si(NCN)2 exhibits bent Si-N-C units with angles of about 143° in its structure. A detailed investigation of amorphous silicon nitride shows that an observed peak asymmetry relates to the proximity of a fifth N neighbor in non-bonding distance between 2.5 and 2.8 Å to Si. We reveal the impact of both Si-N(H)-Si bond angle and Si-N bond length on 29Si δiso in hydrogenated silicon nitride structure, silicon diimide Si(NH)2.},

 abstract = {The behavior of nap-core sandwiches was investigated with a special focus on the effect of symmetry in nap cores. A nap-core is, in general terms, a 3D-formed hollow structure made of knitted textile impregnated by a thermosetting resin. The molding process determines if the nap-core is double-sided (symmetric) or single-sided. The sandwich with nap-core owns various remarkable properties of a novel lightweight material, but the nap-core’s complex structure makes the prediction of these properties a difficult task. While the analysis of a single-sided nap-core sandwich has been presented by the authors before, this study is focused on the simulation of symmetric nap-core sandwich. Overall, performance of the structure is examined with respect to several loading conditions. The simulation approach invokes a typical homogenization scheme to find the engineering properties of the nap-core’s fabric with least computational time and memory resources. Results from experiments and simulations exhibit a good compatibility, which prove the fitness of the modeling method.},

 abstract = {In the example of oxygen diffusion in dilute ferritic iron alloys it is shown that the calculation of the diffusion coefficient can be separated into a contribution related to the migration in the interaction region between oxygen and the substitutional solute and a part related to diffusion in pure body centered cubic (bcc) Fe. The corresponding diffusion times are determined by analytical expressions using Density-Functional-Theory (DFT) data for the respective binding energies. The diffusion coefficient in the interaction region must be determined by atomistic kinetic Monte Carlo (AKMC) simulations with DFT values for the migration barriers as input data. In contrast to previous calculations, AKMC simulation must only be performed for one concentration of the substitutional solute, and the obtained results can be employed to obtain data for other concentrations in a very efficient manner. This leads to a tremendous decrease of computational efforts. Under certain conditions it is even possible to use analytical expressions where merely DFT data for the binding energies are needed. The limits of applicability of the presented calculation procedures are discussed in detail. The methods presented in this work can be generalized to interstitial diffusion in other host materials with small concentrations of substitutional solutes.},

The implementation of mesoscale models is complex and usually involves long computation time, in contrast to the practical industry needs to obtain accurate results rapidly. In addition, when the simulation includes more than one layer of composite ply, the computational time increases even in the case of hybrid models. With the goal of providing useful and rapid prediction tools to the industry, a simplified model has been developed in this work. The model offers an advantage in the reduced computational time compared to a full 3D model (around a 90% faster). The proposed model has been validated against equivalent experimental and numerical results reported in the literature with acceptable deviations and accuracies for design requirements. The proposed numerical model allows the study of the influence of the geometry on the impact response of the composite. Finally, after a parametric study related to the number of layers and angle of impact, using a response surface methodology, a mechanistic model and a surface diagram have been presented in order to help with the calculation of the ballistic limit.},

 abstract = {Coal contains a large number of fractures, whose characteristics are difficult to describe in detail, while their spatial distribution patterns may follow some macroscopic statistical laws. In this paper, several fracture geometric parameters (FGPs) were used to describe a fracture, and the coal seam was represented by a two-dimensional stochastic fracture network (SFN) which was generated and processed through a series of methods in MATLAB. Then, the processed SFN image was able to be imported into COMSOL Multiphysics and converted to a computational domain through the image function. In this way, the influences of different FGPs and their distribution patterns on the permeability of the coal seam were studied, and a finite element model to investigate gas flow properties in the coal seam was carried out. The results show that the permeability of the coal seam increased with the rising of fracture density, length, aperture, and with the decrease of the angle between the fracture orientation and the gas pressure gradient. It has also been found that large-sized fractures have a more significant contribution to coal reservoir permeability. Additionally, a numerical simulation of CBM extraction was carried out to show the potential of the proposed approach in the application of tackling practical engineering problems. According to the results, not only the connectivity of fractures but also variations of gas pressure and velocity can be displayed explicitly, which is consistent well with the actual situation.},

In order to reduce the thermal deformation of ball screws and improve the accuracy, a new adaptive method based on carbon fiber reinforced plastics (CFRP) was proposed in this study and the thermal deformation of ball screws was determined. By using the sequential coupling method, the thermal–structural coupling analysis of a ball screw was conducted based on the finite element method (FEM). The analysis results were verified through a comparison with the experimental results. Based on the verification, an FE model of the improved ball screw was established to study its thermal characteristics. The key design parameters of the improved ball screw were optimized based on the Kriging model and genetic algorithm (GA). The thermal reduction effect of the improved ball screw was validated through the experimental results. The results indicate that the adaptive method proposed in this research is effective in reducing the thermal deformation of ball screws.},

Wrinkling is one of the most critical defects in composite manufacturing. Numerical simulation of the onset and growth of such wrinkles is an important tool for defining optimal process parameters. Herein, several bending experiments of thick laminates are presented. They were found to lead to severe wrinkling and delamination of different kinds. It is shown that the history of loading changed the developed wrinkles. Stress resultant shell finite elements specific to textile reinforcement forming show their relevance to provide, for these wrinkles induced by bending, results in good agreement with the experiments, both with regard to the onset of the wrinkles and to their development.

Experimental tests were carried out to measure the migration of chloride ions in concrete, the tightness of concrete exposed to water under pressure, and the compressive strength and tensile strength of concrete during splitting. Six series of concrete mixes made with CEM IIIA 42.5 and 32.5 cement were tested. The base concrete mix was modified by adding fly ash as a partial cement substitute in the amounts of 25% and 33%. A comparative analysis of the obtained results indicates a significant improvement in tightness, especially in concrete based on CEM IIIA 32.5 cement and resistance to chloride ion penetration for the concretes containing fly ash additive. In the concretes containing fly ash additive, a slower rate of initial strength increase and high strength over a long period of maturation are shown. In accordance with the presented research results, it is suggested that changes to the European standardization system be considered, to allow the use of fly ash additive in concrete made with CEM IIIA 42.5 or 32.5 cement classes. Such a solution is not currently acceptable in standards in some European Countries.},

Four types of structures (Cartesian, Octagonal, Rhomboid, and Starlit) were evaluated in this work, and every structure was prepared in three different volume ratios of the porosity and three different thicknesses. The sound absorption properties of the investigated ABS specimens were examined utilizing the normal incidence sound absorption and noise reduction coefficients, which were experimentally determined by the transfer function method using a two-microphone acoustic impedance tube. This work deals with various factors that influence the sound absorption performance of four different types of investigated ABS material’s structures.

 abstract = {Fibre reinforced plastics have tailorable and superior mechanical characteristics compared to metals and can be used to construct relevant components such as primary crash structures for automobiles. However, the absence of standardized methodologies to predict component level damage has led to their underutilization as compared to their metallic counterparts, which are used extensively to manufacture primary crash structures. This paper presents a methodology that uses crashworthiness results from in-plane impact tests, conducted on carbon-fibre reinforced epoxy flat plates, to tune the related material card in Radioss using two different parametric identification techniques: global and adaptive response search methods. The resulting virtual material model was then successfully validated by comparing the crushing behavior with results obtained from experiments that were conducted by impacting a Formula SAE (Society of Automotive Engineers) crash box. Use of automated identification techniques significantly reduces the development time of composite crash structures, whilst the predictive capability reduces the need for component level tests, thereby making the development process more efficient, automated and economical, thereby reducing the cost of development using composite materials. This in turn promotes the development of vehicles that meet safety standards with lower mass and noxious gas emissions.},

 abstract = {The prediction of springback angle for ultra-thin metallic sheets becomes extremely difficult with the existence of size effects. In this study, size effects on the springback behavior of CuZn20 foils are investigated by experiments and analytical methods. The experimental results reveal that the springback angle first decreases gradually and then increases markedly with the decrease of foil thickness, which cannot be analyzed by current theoretical models. Then, an analytical model based on the Taylor-based nonlocal theory of plasticity is developed, in which the drastic increases of both the proportion of surface grains and the strain gradient are taken into account. Moreover, the influence of strain gradient is modified by the grain-boundary blocking factor. The calculation results show that the springback angle of foils is determined by the intrinsic competition between the decrement angle caused by surface grains and the increment angle caused by the strain gradient. Besides, the relative error of predicted springback angle by the model is less than 15%, which means that the developed model is very useful for improving the quality of micro sheet parts with high accuracy of springback prediction.},

Three concentrations of sulfuric acid (1.5, 5, and 12 M), as well as 12 M with 30% SO3, were used. The reduction of graphene oxide increased with H2SO4 concentration as observed by Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. It was observed that GO lost primarily epoxide functional groups from 40.4 to 9.7% and obtaining 69.8% carbon when using 12 M H2SO4, without leaving sulfur doping. Additionally, the appearance of hexagonal domain structures observed in transmission electron microscopy and analyzed by selected area electron diffraction patterns confirmed the improvement in graphitization. Although the addition of SO3 in H2SO4 improved the GO reduction with 74% carbon, as measured by XPS, the use of SO3 introduced sulfur doping of 1.3%. RGO produced with sulfuric acid was compared with a sample obtained via ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, a very common reduction route, by observing that the RGO produced with sulfuric acid had a higher C/O ratio than the material reduced by UV irradiation. This work showed that sulfuric acid can be used as a single-step reducing agent for RGO without sulfur contamination.},

 abstract = {Nonlinear finite element (FE) analysis of reinforced concrete (RC) structures is characterized by numerous modeling options and input parameters. To accurately model the nonlinear RC behavior involving concrete cracking in tension and crushing in compression, practitioners make different choices regarding the critical modeling issues, e.g., defining the concrete constitutive relations, assigning the bond between the concrete and the steel reinforcement, and solving problems related to convergence difficulties and mesh sensitivities. Thus, it is imperative to review the common modeling choices critically and develop a robust modeling strategy with consistency, reliability, and comparability. This paper proposes a modeling strategy and practical recommendations for the nonlinear FE analysis of RC structures based on parametric studies of critical modeling choices. The proposed modeling strategy aims at providing reliable predictions of flexural responses of RC members with a focus on concrete cracking behavior and crushing failure, which serve as the foundation for more complex modeling cases, e.g., RC beams bonded with fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) laminates. Additionally, herein, the implementation procedure for the proposed modeling strategy is comprehensively described with a focus on the critical modeling issues for RC structures. The proposed strategy is demonstrated through FE analyses of RC beams tested in four-point bending—one RC beam as reference and one beam externally bonded with a carbon-FRP (CFRP) laminate in its soffit. The simulated results agree well with experimental measurements regarding load-deformation relationship, cracking, flexural failure due to concrete crushing, and CFRP debonding initiated by intermediate cracks. The modeling strategy and recommendations presented herein are applicable to the nonlinear FE analysis of RC structures in general.},

High fidelity multi-dendrite simulations were achieved and the results were compared directly with the time-evolved tomography datasets to quantify the relative importance of multi-dendritic growth and coarsening. Coarsening mechanisms under different solidification conditions were further elucidated. The dominant coarsening mechanisms change from small arm melting and interdendritic groove advancement to coalescence when the solid volume fraction approaches ~0.70.

 abstract = {Tribological properties of engineering components are a key issue due to their effect on the operational performance factors such as wear, surface characteristics, service life and in situ behavior. Thus, for better component quality, process parameters have major importance, especially for metal matrix composites (MMCs), which are a special class of materials used in a wide range of engineering applications including but not limited to structural, automotive and aeronautics. This paper deals with the tribological behavior of Cu-B-CrC composites (Cu-main matrix, B-CrC-reinforcement by 0, 2.5, 5 and 7.5 wt.%). The tribological characteristics investigated in this study are the coefficient of friction, wear rate and weight loss. For this purpose, four levels of sliding distance (1000, 1500, 2000 and 2500 m) and four levels of applied load (10, 15, 20 and 25 N) were used. In addition, two levels of sliding velocity (1 and 1.5 m/s), two levels of sintering time (1 and 2 h) and two sintering temperatures (1000 and 1050 °C) were used. Taguchi’s L16 orthogonal array was used to statistically analyze the aforementioned input parameters and to determine their best levels which give the desired values for the analyzed tribological characteristics. The results were analyzed by statistical analysis, optimization and 3D surface plots. Accordingly, it was determined that the most effective factor for wear rate, weight loss and friction coefficients is the contribution rate. According to signal-to-noise ratios, optimum solutions can be sorted as: the highest levels of parameters except for applied load and reinforcement ratio (2500 m, 10 N, 1.5 m/s, 2 h, 1050 °C and 0 wt.%) for wear rate, certain levels of all parameters (1000 m, 10 N, 1.5 m/s, 2 h, 1050 °C and 2.5 wt.%) for weight loss and 1000 m, 15 N, 1 m/s, 1 h, 1000 °C and 0 wt.% for the coefficient of friction. The comprehensive analysis of findings has practical significance and provides valuable information for a composite material from the production phase to the actual working conditions.},

A validated computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model was implemented to simulate the FSW process. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was employed in order to investigate internal materials’ flow. Simulation results revealed that the mechanical work on the joint line increased with the pin angle and larger stir zone forms. The simulation results show that in the angled pin tool, more than 26% of the total heat is produced by the pin. Meanwhile, in other cases, the total heat produced by the pin was near 15% of the total generated heat. The thermo-mechanical cycle in the steel zone increased, and consequently, mechanical interlock between base metals increased. The simulation output demonstrated that the frictional heat generation with a tool without a pin angle is higher than an angled pin. The calculation result also shows that the maximum heat was generated on the steel side.},

@article{ma16176048,
 abstract = {Fibre-reinforced concrete (FRC) has been used for decades in certain applications in the construction industry, such as tunnel linings and precast elements, but has experienced important progress in recent times, boosted by the inclusion of guidelines for its use in some national and international standards. Traditional steel fibres have been studied in depth and their performance is well-known, although in recent years new materials have been proposed as possible alternatives. Polyolefin macro-fibres, for instance, have been proven to enhance the mechanical properties of concrete and the parameters that define their behaviour (fibre length, fibre proportion or casting method, for instance) have been identified. These fibres overcome certain traditional problems related to steel fibres, such as corrosion or their interaction with magnetic fields, which can limit the use of steel in some applications. The behaviour of polyolefin fibre-reinforced concrete (PFRC) has been numerically reproduced with success through an embedded cohesive crack formulation that uses a trilinear softening diagram to describe the fracture behaviour of the material. Furthermore, concrete behaves well under high temperatures or fire events, especially when it is compared with other construction materials, but the behaviour of PFRC must be analysed if the use of these fibres is to be extended. To this end, the degradation of PFRC fracture properties has been recently experimentally analysed under a temperature range between 20 °C and 200 °C. As temperature increases, polyolefin fibres modify their mechanical properties and their shape, which reduce their performance as reinforcements of concrete. In this work, those experimental results, which include results of low (3 kg/m3) and high (10 kg/m3) proportion PFRC specimens, are used as reference to study the fracture behaviour of PFRC exposed to high temperatures from a numerical point of view. The experimental load-deflection diagrams are reproduced by modifying the trilinear diagram used in the cohesive model, which helps to understand how the trilinear diagram parameters are affected by high temperature exposure. Finally, some expressions are proposed to adapt the initial trilinear diagram (obtained with specimens not exposed to high temperature) in order to numerically reproduce the fracture behaviour of PFRC affected by high temperature exposure.},

@article{ma16237322,
 abstract = {The scientific community has raised increasing apprehensions over the transparency and interpretability of machine learning models employed in various domains, particularly in the field of materials science. The intrinsic intricacy of these models frequently results in their characterization as “black boxes”, which poses a difficulty in emphasizing the significance of producing lucid and readily understandable model outputs. In addition, the assessment of model performance requires careful deliberation of several essential factors. The objective of this study is to utilize a deep learning framework called TabNet to predict lead zirconate titanate (PZT) ceramics’ dielectric constant property by employing their components and processes. By recognizing the crucial importance of predicting PZT properties, this research seeks to enhance the comprehension of the results generated by the model and gain insights into the association between the model and predictor variables using various input parameters. To achieve this, we undertake a thorough analysis with Shapley additive explanations (SHAP). In order to enhance the reliability of the prediction model, a variety of cross-validation procedures are utilized. The study demonstrates that the TabNet model significantly outperforms traditional machine learning models in predicting ceramic characteristics of PZT components, achieving a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.047 and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.042. Key contributing factors, such as d33, tangent loss, and chemical formula, are identified using SHAP plots, highlighting their importance in predictive analysis. Interestingly, process time is less effective in predicting the dielectric constant. This research holds considerable potential for advancing materials discovery and predictive systems in PZT ceramics, offering deep insights into the roles of various parameters.},

@article{ma17081723,
 abstract = {Recently, researchers have focused on improving motor performance and efficiency. To manufacture motors with performance and efficiency higher than those of motors manufactured through the additive process, compressibility verification through the parameter control of soft magnetic composites (SMCs) is essential. To this end, this study aims to select suitable powders for manufacturing high-performance, high-efficiency motors by exploring powder mixing ratios and milling times. Through physical property tests, the optimal mixing ratio is predicted using the Multi-Particle Finite Element Method (MPFEM) and powder compression molding analysis, and compressibility is predicted in view of the influence of a change in particle size as a function of the powder mixing ratio and milling time. In addition, based on the result of a comparative analysis of density through experiments and an analysis of internal defects through SEM, a 50:50 mixing ratio of hybrid atomizing and gas atomizing powders milled for 3 h provided the best compressibility. Therefore, the use of SMC cores fabricated using powder compression molding is expected to improve motor performance and efficiency.},

@article{ma17081760,
 abstract = {The paper is concerned with the boundary conditions of explicit gradient elasticity of Mindlin’s type in dynamics. It has been argued in an earlier paper that acceleration terms should not be present in the boundary tractions because of objectivity arguments. This is discussed in the present paper in more detail, and it is supplemented by assuming the validity of the principle of material frame indifference. Furthermore, new examples are discussed in order to illustrate that significant differences exist in the responses predicted by boundary tractions with and without acceleration terms.},
