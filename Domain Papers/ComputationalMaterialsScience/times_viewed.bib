ABSTRACT = {We investigate 29Si nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) chemical shifts, δiso, of silicon nitride. Our goal is to relate the local structure to the NMR signal and, thus, provide the means to extract more information from the experimental 29Si NMR spectra in this family of compounds. We apply structural modeling and the gauge-included projector augmented wave (GIPAW) method within density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Our models comprise known and hypothetical crystalline Si3N4, as well as amorphous Si3N4 structures. We find good agreement with available experimental 29Si NMR data for tetrahedral Si[4] and octahedral Si[6] in crystalline Si3N4, predict the chemical shift of a trigonal-bipyramidal Si[5] to be about −120 ppm, and quantify the impact of Si-N bond lengths on 29Si δiso. We show through computations that experimental 29Si NMR data indicates that silicon dicarbodiimide, Si(NCN)2 exhibits bent Si-N-C units with angles of about 143° in its structure. A detailed investigation of amorphous silicon nitride shows that an observed peak asymmetry relates to the proximity of a fifth N neighbor in non-bonding distance between 2.5 and 2.8 Å to Si. We reveal the impact of both Si-N(H)-Si bond angle and Si-N bond length on 29Si δiso in hydrogenated silicon nitride structure, silicon diimide Si(NH)2.},

ABSTRACT = {We proposed and fabricated a flexible, planar, U-shape-modified structure metamaterial (MM) that was composed of two metallic pattern layers separated by a polyimide layer, where each metallic pattern layer consists of two U-shaped split ring resonators (USRRs). The coupling effect between the two USRRs in the same metallic layer was vital to the formation of dual toroidal dipole (TD) resonances. The measured and simulated results showed that both low quality factor (Q) (~1.82) and high Q (~10.31) TD resonances were acquired synchronously at two different frequencies in the MMs by adjusting the distance between the two coplanar USRRs. With the interaction of the USRRs, the energy levels of the USRRs were split into inductance-capacitance (LC)-induced TD resonance at low frequency and dipole-induced TD resonance at high frequency. Thus, the electric multipole interaction played an important role in determining the energy level of the TD resonance. The better strength of the high frequency TD resonance can be confined to an electromagnetic field inside a smaller circular region, and thus, a higher Q was obtained. In order to investigate the TD mechanism more in depth, the power of the electric dipole, magnetic dipole, electric circular dipole, and TD were quantitatively calculated. Dual TD MMs on a freestanding substrate will have potential applications in functional terahertz devices for practical applications.},

ABSTRACT = {In this work, we assess the effects of sterilization in materials manufactured using additive manufacturing by employing a sterilization technique used in the food industry. To estimate the feasibility of the hydrostatic high-pressure (HHP) sterilization of biomedical devices, we have evaluated the mechanical properties of specimens produced by commercial 3D printers. Evaluations of the potential advantages and drawbacks of Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM), Digital Light Processing (DLP) technology, and Stereolithography (SLA) were considered for this study due to their widespread availability. Changes in mechanical properties due to the proposed sterilization technique were compared to values derived from the standardized autoclaving methodology. Enhancement of the mechanical properties of samples treated with Hydrostatic high-pressure processing enhanced mechanical properties, with a 30.30% increase in the tensile modulus and a 26.36% increase in the ultimate tensile strength. While traditional autoclaving was shown to systematically reduce the mechanical properties of the materials employed and damages and deformation on the surfaces were observed, HHP offered an alternative for sterilization without employing heat. These results suggest that while forgoing high-temperature for sanitization, HHP processing can be employed to take advantage of the flexibility of additive manufacturing technologies for manufacturing implants, instruments, and other devices.},

ABSTRACT = {The cohesive zone model (CZM) has found wide acceptance as a tool for the simulation of delamination in composites and debonding in bonded joints and various implementations of the cohesive zone model dedicated to fatigue problems have been proposed in the past decade. In previous works, the authors have developed a model based on cohesive zone to simulate the propagation of fatigue defects where damage acts on cohesive stiffness, with an initial (undamaged) stiffness representative of that of the entire thickness of an adhesive layer. In the case of a stiffness that is order of magnitude higher than the previous one (for instance, in the simulation of the ply-to-ply interface in composites), the model prediction becomes inaccurate. In this work, a new formulation of the model that overcomes this limitation is developed. Finite element simulations have been conducted on a mode I, constant bending (constant G)-loaded double cantilever beam (DCB) joint to assess the response of the new model with respect to the original one for varying initial stiffness K0 and cohesive strength σ0. The results showed that the modified model is robust with respect to changes of two orders of magnitude in initial stiffness and of a factor of two in σ0.},

ABSTRACT = {The diffusion of composite materials in aeronautical and aerospace applications is attributable to the high specific mechanical properties they offer. In particular, the recent use of Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) materials is highly increased. The main disadvantage in using this kind of material is related to the possibility of including damages or defects not visible on the surface that compromise their behavior and make their use extremely unsafe if not properly supervised. The most conventional nondestructive techniques allow the detection of damages when they already compromise the life of these materials. The use of the same techniques makes it harder to monitor in-situ of the progress of damages, especially if they occur inside the materials. The implementation of the innovative strain analysis method, like those based on full-field measurements, could provide additional information about the damage mechanisms by supplying the complete strain distribution of the surface of the sample. The present paper examines the mechanical behavior of two different CFRP specimens, with and without damage, subjected to compressive load in an anti-buckling fixture by using the Digital Image Correlation (DIC). The purpose is to measure the out-of-plane displacements, characteristics of the compression tests, in all the points of the ROI (Region of Interest), using a full-field and noncontact technique. The innovative aspect of this work is therefore to solve this problem through an experimental approach with DIC 3D technique.},

ABSTRACT = {Ab initio calculations were conducted to assist the construction of the n-body potential of the Ti-Nb-Al ternary metal system. Applying the constructed Ti-Nb-Al interatomic potential, molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations were performed to predict a quadrilateral composition region, within which metallic glass was energetically favored to be formed. In addition, the amorphous driving force of those predicted possible glassy alloys was derived and an optimized composition around Ti15Nb45Al40 was pinpointed, implying that this alloy was easier to be obtained. The atomic structure of Ti-Nb-Al metallic glasses was identified by short-, medium-, and extended-range analysis/calculations, and their hierarchical structures were responsible to the formation ability and unique properties in many aspects.},

ABSTRACT = {In the last decades, the increasing use of laminate materials, such as carbon fibre reinforced plastics, in several engineering applications has pushed researchers to deeply investigate their mechanical behavior, especially in consideration of the delamination process, which could affect their performance. The need for improving the capability of the current instruments in predicting some collapse or strength reduction due to hidden damages leads to the necessity to combine numerical models with experimental campaigns. The validation of the numerical models could give useful information about the mechanical response of the materials, providing predictive data about their lifetime. The purpose of the delamination tests is to collect reliable results by monitoring the delamination growth of the simulated in situ cracking and use them to validate the numerical models. In this work, an experimental campaign was carried out on high performance composite laminates with respect to the delamination mode I; subsequently, a numerical model representative of the experimental setup was built. The ANSYS Workbench Suite was used to simulate the delamination phenomena and modeFRONTIER was applied for the numerical/experimental calibration of the constitutive relationship on the basis of the delamination process, whose mechanism was implemented by means of the cohesive zone material (CZM) model.},

ABSTRACT = {Triple-layered composite plates are created by joining three composite layers using shear connectors. These layers, which are assumed to be always in contact and able to move relatively to each other during deformation, could be the same or different in geometric dimensions and material. They are applied in various engineering fields such as ship-building, aircraft wing manufacturing, etc. However, there are only a few publications regarding the calculation of this kind of plate. This paper proposes novel equations, which utilize Mindlin’s theory and finite element modelling to simulate the forced vibration of triple-layered composite plates with layers connected by shear connectors subjected to a moving load. Moreover, a Matlab computation program is introduced to verify the reliability of the proposed equations, as well as the influence of some parameters, such as boundary conditions, the rigidity of the shear connector, thickness-to-length ratio, and the moving load velocity on the dynamic response of the composite plate.},

ABSTRACT = {The shrinkage of reinforced polymer composites in injection molding varies, depending on the properties of the reinforcing agent. Therefore, the study of optimal reinforcement conditions, to minimize shrinkage when talc and glass fibers (GF) (which are commonly used as reinforcements) are incorporated into polypropylene (PP), is required. In this study, we investigated the effect of reinforcement factors, such as reinforcement type, reinforcement content, and reinforcement particle size, on the shrinkage, and optimized these factors to minimize the shrinkage of the PP composites. We measured the shrinkage of injection-molded samples, and, based on the measured values, the optimal conditions were obtained through analysis of variance (ANOVA), the Taguchi method, and regression analysis. It was found that reinforcement type had the largest influence on shrinkage among the three factors, followed by reinforcement content. In contrast, the reinforcement size was not significant, compared to the other two factors. If the reinforcement size was set as an uncontrollable factor, the optimum condition for minimizing directional shrinkage was the incorporation of 20 wt % GF and that for differential shrinkage was the incorporation of 20 wt % talc. In addition, a shrinkage prediction method was proposed, in which two reinforcing agents were incorporated into PP, for the optimization of various dependent variables. The results of this study are expected to provide answers about which reinforcement agent should be selected and incorporated to minimize the shrinkage of PP composites.},

ABSTRACT = {The mechanical characterization of textile composites is a challenging task, due to their nonuniform deformation and complicated failure phenomena. This article introduces a three-dimensional mesoscale finite element model to investigate the progressive damage behavior of a notched single-layer triaxially-braided composite subjected to axial tension. The damage initiation and propagation in fiber bundles are simulated using three-dimensional failure criteria and damage evolution law. A traction–separation law has been applied to predict the interfacial damage of fiber bundles. The proposed model is correlated and validated by the experimentally measured full field strain distributions and effective strength of the notched specimen. The progressive damage behavior of the fiber bundles is studied by examining the damage and stress contours at different loading stages. Parametric numerical studies are conducted to explore the role of modeling parameters and geometric characteristics on the internal damage behavior and global measured properties of the notched specimen. Moreover, the correlations of damage behavior, global stress–strain response, and the efficiency of the notched specimen are discussed in detail. The results of this paper deliver a throughout understanding of the damage behavior of braided composites and can help the specimen design of textile composites.},

ABSTRACT = {Accelerated construction in the form of steel–concrete composite beams is among the most efficient methods to construct highway bridges. One of the main problems with this type of composite structures, which has not yet been fully clarified in the case of continuous beam, is the crack zone initiation that gradually expands through the beam width. In the current study, a semi-empirical model was proposed to predict the size of cracks in terms of small box girder deflection and intensity of load applied on the structure. To this end, a set of steel–concrete composite small box girders were constructed by the use of steel fibrous concrete and experimentally tested under different caseloads. The results were then used to create a dataset of the box girder response in terms of beam deflection and crack width. The obtained dataset was then utilized to develop a simplified formula providing the maximum width of cracks. The results showed that the cracks initiated in the hogging moment region when the load exceeded 80 kN. Additionally, it was observed that the maximum cracked zone occurred in the center of the beam due to the maximum negative moment. Moreover, the crack width of the box girder at different loading cases was compared with the test results obtained from the literature. A good agreement has been found between the proposed model and experiment results.},

ABSTRACT = {The performance characterization of the manufacturing processes for additive manufacturing (AM) systems is a significant task for their standardization and implementation in the industry. Also, there is a large diversity of materials used in different AM processes. In the present paper, a methodology is proposed to evaluate, in different directions, the performance of an AM process and material characterization in terms of surface quality. This methodology consists of eight steps, based on a new surface inspection artifact and basic artifact orientations. The proposed artifact with several design configurations fits different AM systems sizes and meets the needs of customers. The effects of main factors on the surface roughness of up-facing platens of the artifacts are investigated using the statistical design of experiments. The proposed methodology is validated by a case study focused on PolyJet material jetting technology. Samples are manufactured of photopolymer resins and post-processed. Three factors (i.e., artifact orientation, platen orientation, and finish type) are considered for the investigation. The case study results show that the platen orientation, finish type, and their interaction have a significant influence on the surface roughness (Ra). The best Ra roughness results were obtained for the glossy finish type in the range of 0.5–4 μm.},

ABSTRACT = {This research concerning the topic, pursues the design, manufacturing, analysis and testing of the manhole cover that may be used in pedestrian networks. Although there are certain commercially available manhole covers made of glass-reinforced composites, there are a few papers published related to the modelling, simulation and mechanical testing of such parts. Herein, the manhole cover is made of the sandwich composite. The novelty of this kind of cover is to use an oriented strand board (OSB) as the core between two sides containing layers, which are reinforced with glass fibers. The OSB core leads to the increase of the stiffness-weight ratio. The paper describes the materials corresponding to the layers of the composite cover, geometry of the cover, technology used to manufacture the bending specimens and cover tested. Specimens made of materials that correspond to each layer of the cover, are tested in bending in order to determine their mechanical properties (flexural strength and flexural modulus). Bending tests and testing of the cover are also described. The composite manhole cover is also analysed by the finite element method to obtain the state of stresses and strains. The strains of the manhole cover are experimentally measured by using the tensometric method. Finally, comparing the strains with the strains experimentally measured validates the numerical simulation model.},

ABSTRACT = {Smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) and the finite element method (FEM) are often combined with the scope to model the interaction between structures and the surrounding fluids (FSI). There is the case, for instance, of aircrafts crashing on water or speedboats slamming into waves. Due to the high computational complexity, the influence of air is often neglected, limiting the analysis to the interaction between structure and water. On the contrary, this work aims to specifically investigate the effect of air when merged inside the fluid–structure interaction (FSI) computational models. Measures from experiments were used as a basis to validate estimations comparing results from models that include or exclude the presence of air. Outcomes generally showed a great correlation between simulation and experiments, with marginal differences in terms of accelerations, especially during the first phase of impact and considering the presence of air in the model.},

ABSTRACT = {Elevated temperature exposure has a negative effect on the performance of the matrix resin in Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastics (CFRP) plates, whereas limited quantitative research focuses on the deteriorations. Therefore, 30 CFRP specimens were designed and tested under elevated temperatures (10, 30, 50, 70, and 90 °C) to explore the degradations in tensile properties. The effect of temperature on the failure mode, stress-strain curve, tensile strength, elastic modulus and elongation of CFRP plates were investigated. The results showed that elevated temperature exposure significantly changed the failure characteristics. When the exposed temperature increased from 10 °C to 90 °C, the failure mode changed from the global factures in the whole CFRP plate to the successive fractures in carbon fibers. Moreover, with temperatures increasing, tensile strength and elongation of CFRP plates decreases gradually while the elastic modulus shows negligible change. Finally, the results of One-Way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) show that the degradation of the tensile strength of CFRP plates was due to the impact of elevated temperature exposure, rather than the test error.},

ABSTRACT = {The effect of the Ni/Si mass ratio and combined thermomechanical treatment on the microstructure and properties of ternary Cu-Ni-Si alloys is discussed systematically. The Cu-Ni-Si alloy with a Ni/Si mass ratio of 4–5 showed good comprehensive properties. Precipitates with disc-like shapes were confirmed as the Ni2Si phase with orthorhombic structure through transmission electron microscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, and 3D atom probe characterization. After the appropriate thermomechanical treatment, the studied alloy with a Ni/Si mass ratio of 4.2 exhibited excellent mechanical properties: a hardness of 290 HV, tensile strength of 855 MPa, yield strength of 782 MPa, and elongation of 4.5%. Compared with other approaches, the thermomechanical treatment increased the hardness and strength without sacrificing electrical conductivity. Theoretical calculations indicated that the high strength was primarily attributed to the Orowan precipitation strengthening and secondarily ascribed to the work hardening, which were highly consistent with the experimental results. The appropriate Ni/Si mass ratio with a low content of Ni and Si atoms shows high strength and excellent electrical conductivity through combined thermomechanical treatment. This work provides a guideline for the design and preparation of multicomponent Cu-Ni-Si-X alloys with ultrahigh strength and excellent electrical conductivity.},

ABSTRACT = {In this study, the effect of the impact angle of a projectile during low-velocity impact on Kevlar fabrics has been investigated using a simplified numerical model. The implementation of mesoscale models is complex and usually involves long computation time, in contrast to the practical industry needs to obtain accurate results rapidly. In addition, when the simulation includes more than one layer of composite ply, the computational time increases even in the case of hybrid models. With the goal of providing useful and rapid prediction tools to the industry, a simplified model has been developed in this work. The model offers an advantage in the reduced computational time compared to a full 3D model (around a 90% faster). The proposed model has been validated against equivalent experimental and numerical results reported in the literature with acceptable deviations and accuracies for design requirements. The proposed numerical model allows the study of the influence of the geometry on the impact response of the composite. Finally, after a parametric study related to the number of layers and angle of impact, using a response surface methodology, a mechanistic model and a surface diagram have been presented in order to help with the calculation of the ballistic limit.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, a 2-node beam element is developed based on Quasi-3D beam theory and mixed formulation for static bending of functionally graded (FG) beams. The transverse shear strains and stresses of the proposed beam element are parabolic distributions through the thickness of the beam and the transverse shear stresses on the top and bottom surfaces of the beam vanish. The proposed beam element is free of shear-looking without selective or reduced integration. The material properties of the functionally graded beam are assumed to vary according to the power-law index of the volume fraction of the constituents through the thickness of the beam. The numerical results of this study are compared with published results to illustrate the accuracy and convenience rate of the new beam element. The influence of some parametrics on the bending behavior of FGM beams is investigated.},

ABSTRACT = {Metal additive manufacturing can produce geometrically complex parts with effective cost. The high thermal gradients due to the repeatedly rapid heat and solidification cause defects in the produced parts, such as cracks, porosity, undesired residual stress, and part distortion. Different techniques were employed for temperature investigation. Experimental measurement and finite element method-based numerical models are limited by the restricted accessibility and expensive computational cost, respectively. The available physics-based analytical model has promising short computational efficiency without resorting to finite element method or any iteration-based simulations. However, the heat transfer boundary condition cannot be considered without the involvement of finite element method or iteration-based simulations, which significantly reduces the computational efficiency, and thus the usefulness of the developed model. This work presents an explicit and closed-form solution, namely heat sink solution, to consider the heat transfer boundary condition. The heat sink solution was developed from the moving point heat source solution based on heat transfer of convection and radiation. The part boundary is mathematically discretized into many heats sinks due to the non-uniform temperature distribution, which causes non-uniform heat loss. The temperature profiles, thermal gradients, and temperature-affected material properties are calculated and presented. Good agreements were observed upon validation against experimental molten pool measurements.},

ABSTRACT = {Plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition (PEALD) is a widely used, powerful layer-by-layer coating technology. Here, we present an atomistic simulation scheme for PEALD processes, combining the Monte Carlo deposition algorithm and structure relaxation using molecular dynamics. In contrast to previous implementations, our approach employs a real, atomistic model of the precursor. This allows us to account for steric hindrance and overlap restrictions at the surface corresponding to the real precursor deposition step. In addition, our scheme takes various process parameters into account, employing predefined probabilities for precursor products at each Monte Carlo deposition step. The new simulation protocol was applied to investigate PEALD synthesis of SiO2 thin films using the bis-diethylaminosilane precursor. It revealed that increasing the probability for precursor binding to one surface oxygen atom favors amorphous layer growth, a large number of –OH impurities, and the formation of voids. In contrast, a higher probability for precursor binding to two surface oxygen atoms leads to dense SiO2 film growth and a reduction of –OH impurities. Increasing the probability for the formation of doubly bonded precursor sites is therefore the key factor for the formation of dense SiO2 PEALD thin films with reduced amounts of voids and –OH impurities.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper presents a radar cross-section (RCS) reduction technique by using the coding diffusion metasurface, which is optimised through a random optimization algorithm. The design consists of two unit cells, which are elements ‘1’ and ‘0’. The reflection phase between the two-unit cells has a 180° ± 37° phase difference. It has a working frequency band from 8.6 GHz to 22.5 GHz, with more than 9 dB RCS reduction. The monostatic RCS reduction has a wider bandwidth of coding diffusion metasurface as compared to the traditional chessboard metasurface. In addition, the bistatic performance of the designed metasurfaces is observed at 15.4 GHz, which shows obvious RCS reduction when compared to a metallic plate of the same size. The simulated and measured result shows the proficiency of the designed metasurface.},

ABSTRACT = {The initial stability of a dental implant is known to be an indicator of osseointegration at immediate loading upon insertion. Implant designs have a fundamental role in the initial stability. Although new designs with advanced surface technology have been suggested for the initial stability of implant systems, verification is not simple because of various assessment factors. Our study focused on comparing the initial stability between two different implant systems via design aspects. A simulated model corresponding to the first molar derived from the mandibular bone was constructed. Biomechanical characteristics between the two models were compared by finite element analysis (FEA). Mechanical testing was also performed to derive the maximum loads for the two implant systems. CMI IS-III active (IS-III) had a more desirable stress distribution than CMI IS-II active (IS-II) in the surrounding bone region. Moreover, IS-III decreased the stress transfer to the nerve under the axial loading direction more than IS-II. Changes of implant design did not affect the maximum load. Our analyses suggest that the optimized design (IS-III), which has a bigger bone volume without loss of initial fixation, may minimize the bone damage during fixture insertion and we expect greater effectiveness in older patients.},

ABSTRACT = {The penetration enhancement behaviors of a reactive material double-layered liner (RM-DLL) shaped charge against thick steel targets are investigated. The RM-DLL comprises an inner copper liner, coupled with an outer PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene)/Al reactive material liner, fabricated via a cold pressing/sintering process. This RM-DLL shaped charge presents a novel defeat mechanism that incorporates the penetration capability of a precursor copper jet and the chemical energy release of a follow-thru reactive material penetrator. Experimental results showed that, compared with the single reactive liner shaped charge jet, a deeper penetration depth was produced by the reactive material-copper jet, whereas the penetration performance and reactive material mass entering the penetrated target strongly depended on the reactive liner thickness and standoff. To further illustrate the penetration enhancement mechanism, numerical simulations based on AUTODYN-2D code were conducted. Numerical results indicated that, with increasing reactive liner thickness, the initiation delay time of the reactive materials increased significantly, which caused the penetration depth and the follow-thru reactive material mass to increase for a given standoff. This new RM-DLL shaped charge configuration provides an extremely efficient method to enhance the penetration damage to various potential targets, such as armored fighting vehicles, naval vessels, and concrete targets.},

ABSTRACT = {Micromechanical fatigue lifetime predictions, in particular for the high cycle fatigue regime, require an appropriate modelling of mean stress effects in order to account for lifetime reducing positive mean stresses. Focus of this micromechanical study is the comparison of three selected fatigue indicator parameters (FIPs), with respect to their applicability to different total strain ratios. In this work, investigations are performed on the modelling and prediction of the fatigue crack initiation life of the martensitic high-strength steel SAE 4150 for two different total strain ratios. First, multiple martensitic statistical volume elements (SVEs) are generated by multiscale Voronoi tessellations. Micromechanical fatigue simulations are then performed on these SVEs by means of a crystal plasticity model to obtain microstructure dependent fatigue responses. In order to account for the material specific fatigue damage zone, a non-local homogenisation scheme for the FIPs is introduced for lath martensitic microstructures. The numerical results of the different non-local FIPs are compared with experimental fatigue crack initiation results for two different total strain ratios. It is concluded that the multiaxial fatigue criteria proposed by Fatemi-Socie is superior for predicting fatigue crack initiation life to the energy dissipation criteria and the accumulated plastic slip criteria for the investigated total strain ratios.},

ABSTRACT = {To fabricate large-scale or unusually shaped composite structures, pieces of fabric plies can be spliced to match size and shape requirements, forming ply splice structures. The junction of different plies can be considered as a defect in the resulting composite material, affecting the overall mechanical properties. In this paper, unidirectional carbon fiber-reinforced plastic (CFRP) with ply splices was used as a research object to study these potential material defects. The effects of ply splices at different positions on the tensile properties of CFRP and the coupling between position of ply splicing were analyzed. Simultaneously, a finite element model was established to analyze the damage evolution, in which a continuous damage model and a cohesive zone model were used to describe the damage of the composite and interface layers, respectively. The model results were in good agreement with observed experimental results. Our results showed that there were three main factors for this failure mechanism: boundary effects, whether the ply splices were independent, or whether they were close to each other. In short, when two ply splices were located at the edge or independent of each other, the failure mode was first delamination and then fiber fracture, and the tensile strength was high. However, when the two ply splices were close to the edge or close to each other, the failure mode was first local fiber fracture and then delamination damage, and the resulting tensile strength was low. Finally, different reinforcement methods to improve the tensile properties of composites were adopted for the splicing layers at different positions through the analysis via model simulation. The two-side patch repair method was used to reinforce the ply splices on or near the edge. Additionally, increasing the toughness of the adhesive layer was used to reinforce the ply splices that were inside the material. These results showed that the tensile strength was enhanced by these two methods of reinforcement, and the initial damage load was especially increased.},

ABSTRACT = {One ambitious objective of Integrated Computational Materials Engineering (ICME) is to shorten the materials development cycle by using computational materials simulation techniques at different length scales. In this regard, the most important aspects are the prediction of the microstructural evolution during material processing and the understanding of the contributions of microstructural features to the mechanical response of the materials. One possible solution to such a challenge is to apply the Phase Field (PF) method because it can predict the microstructural evolution under the influence of different internal or external stimuli, including deformation. To accomplish this, it is necessary to take into account plasticity or, specifically, non-homogeneous plastic deformation, which is particularly important for investigating the size effects in materials emerging at the micron length scale. In this work, we present quasi-2D simulations of plastic deformation in a face centred cubic system using a finite strain formulation. Our model consists of dislocation-based strain gradient crystal plasticity implemented into a PF code. We apply this model to study the influence of grain size on the mechanical behavior of polycrystals, which includes dislocation storage and annihilation. Furthermore, the initial state of the material before deformation is also considered. The results show that a dislocation-based strain gradient crystal plasticity model can capture the Hall-Petch effect in many aspects. The model reproduced the correct functional dependence of the flow stress of the polycrystal on grain size without assigning any special properties to the grain boundaries. However, the predicted Hall-Petch coefficients are significantly smaller than those found typically in experiments. In any case, we found a good qualitative agreement between our findings and experimental results.},

ABSTRACT = {We have calculated that with the world population projected to increase from 7.5 billion in 2017 to 9.8 in 2050, the next generation (within 33 years) will produce 12,000–13,000 Mt of plastic, and that the yearly consumption will reach 37–40 kilos of plastic per person worldwide. One of the branches of the plastics industry is the production of plastics for agriculture e.g., seed trays and pots. In this paper, novel metakaolin-based geopolymer composites reinforced with cellulosic fibres are presented as an alternative to plastic pots. Materials can be dedicated to agricultural applications, provided they have neutral properties, however, geopolymer paste and its final products have high pH. Therefore, a two-step protocol of neutralisation of the geopolymer foam pots was optimised and implemented. The strength of the geopolymer samples was lower when foams were neutralised. The reinforcement of geopolymers with cellulose clearly prevented the reduction of mechanical properties after neutralisation, which was correlated with the lower volume of pores in the foam and with the cellulose chemical properties. Both, neutralisation and reinforcement with cellulose can also eliminate an efflorescence. Significantly increased plant growth was found in geopolymer pots in comparison to plastic pots. The cellulose in geopolymers resulted in better adsorption and slower desorption of minerals during fertilisation. This effect could also be associated with a lower number of large pores in the presence of cellulose fibres in pots, and thus more stable pore filling and better protection of internal surface interactions.},

ABSTRACT = {The continuous drive towards higher specific power and lower displacement engines in recent years place increasingly higher loads on the internal combustion engine materials. This necessitates a more robust collection of reliable material data for computational fatigue life prediction to develop reliable engines and reduce developmental costs. Monotonic tensile testing and cyclic stress and strain-controlled testing of A356-T7 + 0.5 wt.% Cu cast aluminium alloys have been performed. The uniaxial tests were performed on polished test bars extracted from highly loaded areas of cast cylinder heads. The monotonic deformation tests indicate that the material has an elastic-plastic monotonic response with plastic hardening. The strain controlled uniaxial low cycle fatigue tests were run at multiple load levels to capture the cyclic deformation behaviour and the corresponding fatigue lives. The equivalent stress-controlled fatigue tests were performed to study the influence of the loading mode on the cyclic deformation and fatigue lives. The two types of tests exhibit similar fatigue lives and stress-strain responses indicating minimal influence of the mode of loading in fatigue testing of A356 + T7 alloys. The material exhibits a non-linear deformation behaviour with a mixed isotropic and kinematic hardening behaviour that saturates after the initial few cycles. There exists significant scatter in the tested replicas for both monotonic and cyclic loading.},

ABSTRACT = {The present study aimed to optimize the phase constituents and mechanical properties of the spark plasma sintered (SPS) Inconel 718 (IN718) alloy. A series of heat treatment routes were designed based on the phase relations in IN718 and performed for the optimization. The microstructure and phase compositions of the SPS IN718 alloys were examined by using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy disperse spectroscopy (EDS), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The mechanical properties of the samples were characterized at room temperature and at 650 °C. The results showed that large amounts of γ” (Ni3Nb) and γ’ (Ni3(Al, Ti)) strengthening phases precipitated in the IN718 alloy after direct aging (DA) of the as-fabricated sample. Moreover, the mechanical properties of the DA sample were comparable to that of the best one of the solution-treated and aged counterparts. The analysis showed that the rapid sintering and solid solution treatment of the IN718 alloy were achieved simultaneously by SPS. In the case of the SPS IN718 material, the direct aging regime had the same heat treatment effect as the conventional solid solution and aging treatment. This contributes toward improving the production efficiency and reduces manufacturing costs in the actual production process.},

ABSTRACT = {A microstructure finite element method combining the cohesive zone model (CZM) is used to simulate the mechanical behavior, deformation, and failure of polymer-bonded explosive (PBX) 9501 under quasi-static loading. PBX 9501 consists of Cyclotetramethylene tetranitramine (HMX) filler particles with a random distribution packaged in a polymeric binder. The particle is treated as elastic and the binder as viscoelastic. Cohesive elements with a bilinear softening law are inserted into the particle/binder interface, the HMX particle, and the binder to study the interface’s debonding and failure evolution. Macroscopic stress–strain curves homogenized across the microstructure under tension and compression with different strain rates are basically consistent with the experimental data. The interface debonding approximately vertical to the loading direction is the primary failure mechanism under tension, while shear failure along the interfaces and particle fracture plays a significant role under compression. The effects of interface strengths and strain rates on the performance of PBX 9501 are also evaluated. The tensile and compressive strengths are dependent on the interface strength and strain rate, but the failure paths are insensitive. This model is shown to accurately predict macroscopic responses and improve our understanding of the relationship between the mechanical behavior and microstructure of PBX 9501.},

ABSTRACT = {Magnesium is one of the lightest metals for structural components. It has been used for producing various lightweight cast components, but the application of magnesium sheet plates is less widespread. There are two reasons for this: (i) its poor formability at ambient temperatures; and (ii) insufficient data on its durability, especially for dynamic loading. In this article, an innovative approach to predicting the fatigue life of the AZ31 magnesium alloy is presented. It is based on an energy approach that links the strain–energy density with the fatigue life. The core of the presented methodology is a comprehensive new model for tensile and compressive loading paths, which makes it possible to calculate the strain–energy density of closed hysteresis loops. The model is universal for arbitrary strain amplitudes. The material parameters are determined from several low-cycle fatigue tests. The presented approach was validated with examples of variable strain histories.},

ABSTRACT = {Weft-knitted fabrics offer an excellent formability into complex shapes for composite application. In biaxial weft-knitted fabric, additional yarns are inserted in the warp (wale-wise) and weft (course-wise) directions as a reinforcement. Due to these straight yarns, the mechanical properties of such fabrics are better than those of unreinforced weft-knitted fabrics. The forming process of flat fabrics into 3D preforms is challenging and requires numerical simulation. In this paper, the mechanical behavior of biaxial weft-knitted fabrics is simulated by means of macro- and meso-scale finite element method (FEM) models. The macro-scale modelling approach is based on a shell element formulation and offers reasonable computational costs but has some limitations by the description of fabric mechanical characteristics and forming behavior. The meso-scale modelling approach based on beam elements can describe the fabric’s mechanical and forming characteristics better at a higher computational cost. The FEM models were validated by comparing the results of various simulations with the equivalent experiments. With the help of the parametric models, the forming of biaxial weft-knitted fabrics into complex shapes can be simulated. These models help to predict material and process parameters for optimized forming conditions without the necessity of costly experimental trials.},

ABSTRACT = {Interaction between dislocations and grain boundaries (GBs) in the forms of dislocation absorption, emission, and slip transmission at GBs significantly affects size-dependent plasticity in fine-grained polycrystals. Thus, it is vital to consider those GB mechanisms in continuum plasticity theories. In the present paper, a new GB model is proposed by considering slip transmission at GBs within the framework of gradient polycrystal plasticity. The GB model consists of the GB kinematic relations and governing equations for slip transmission, by which the influence of geometric factors including the misorientation between the incoming and outgoing slip systems and GB orientation, GB defects, and stress state at GBs are captured. The model is numerically implemented to study a benchmark problem of a bicrystal thin film under plane constrained shear. It is found that GB parameters, grain size, grain misorientation, and GB orientation significantly affect slip transmission and plastic behaviors in fine-grained polycrystals. Model prediction qualitatively agrees with experimental observations and results of discrete dislocation dynamics simulations.},

ABSTRACT = {Skid resistance is an important surface characteristic that influences roadway safety. Various studies have been performed to understand the interaction between pavement and tires through numerical simulation for skid resistance prediction. However, the friction parameters required for simulation inputs are generally determined by objective assumptions. This paper develops a finite element method (FEM)-based skid resistance simulation framework using in-situ 3D pavement surface texture and skid resistance data. A 3D areal pavement model is reconstructed from high resolution asphalt pavement surface texture data. The exponential decay friction model is implemented in the simulation and the interface friction parameters required for the simulation are determined using the binary search back-calculation approach based on a trial process with the desired level of differences between simulated and observed skid numbers. To understand the influence of texture characteristics on interface friction parameters, the high-resolution 3D texture data is separated into macro- and micro-scales through Butterworth filtering and various areal texture indicators are calculated at both levels. Principal component analysis (PCA) regression analysis is conducted to quantify the relationship between various texture characteristics and the interface friction parameters. The results from this study can be used to better prepare the inputs of friction parameters for FEM simulation.},

As a starting point, the influence of Young’s modulus (E), the cohesion energy density (CED), and the diameter of the Al2O3 particles (D) on the results was analyzed. This analysis allowed to distinguish that E and CED were the most influential factors. Therefore, a more extensive examination of these two factors was performed afterward, using a fixed value of D. The analysis of the combined effect of these factors made it possible to calibrate the DEM models, and consequently, after this calibration, the compacts had an adequate final shape quality and the maximum force applied in the simulations matched with the experimental one. However, the porosity of the simulated compacts was higher than that of the real ones. To reduce the porosity of the compacts, lower values of D were also modeled. Consequently, the relative deviation of the porosity was reduced from 40–50% to 20%, using a value of D equal to 0.15 mm.},

ABSTRACT = {Steel corrosion is considered as the main factor for the insufficient durability of concrete structures, especially in the marine environment. In this paper, to further inhibit steel corrosion in a high chloride environment and take advantage of the dual-functional carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP), the impressed current cathodic protection (ICCP) technique was applied to the hybrid-reinforced concrete beam with internally embedded CFRP bars and steel fiber reinforced polymer composite bar (SFCB) as the anode material while the steel bar was compelled to the cathode. The effect of the new ICCP system on the flexural performance of the hybrid-reinforced concrete beam subjected to corrosion was verified experimentally. First, the electricity-accelerated precorrosion test was performed for the steel bar in the hybrid-reinforced beams with a target corrosion ratio of 5%. Then, the dry–wet cycles corrosion was conducted and the ICCP system was activated simultaneously for the hybrid-reinforced concrete beam for 180 days. Finally, the three-point bending experiment was carried out for the hybrid-reinforced concrete beams. The steel bars were taken out from the concrete to quantitatively measure the corrosion ratio after flexural tests. Results showed that the further corrosion of steel bars could be inhibited effectively by the ICCP treatment with the CFRP bar and the SFCB as the anode. Additionally, the ICCP system showed an obvious effect on the flexural behavior of the hybrid-reinforced concrete beams: The crack load and ultimate load, as well as the stiffness, were enhanced notably compared with the beam without ICCP treatment. Compared with the SFCB anode, the ICCP system with the CFRP bar as the anode material was more effective for the hybrid-reinforced concrete beam to prevent the steel corrosion.},

ABSTRACT = {Fused filament fabrication (FFF) is one of the most popular additive manufacturing (AM) techniques used to fabricate polymeric structures. However, these polymeric structures suffer from an inherent deficiency of weak inter-laminar tensile strength. Because of this weak inter-laminar strength, these parts fail prematurely and exhibit only a fraction of the mechanical properties of those fabricated using conventional means. In this paper, we study the effect of thermal annealing in the presence of an initially applied static uniaxial load on the ultimate tensile strength of parts fabricated using FFF. Tensile specimens or dogbones were fabricated from an acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) filament with a glass transition temperature (Tg) of 105 °C; these specimens were then isothermally annealed, post manufacture, in a fixture across a given range of temperatures and static loads. Tensile testing was then performed on these specimens to gauge the effect of the thermal annealing and static loading on inter-laminar tensile strength by measuring the ultimate tensile strength of the specimens. A design of experiments (DOE) approach was followed to calculate the main and interaction effects of the two factors (temperature and static loading) on the ultimate tensile strength, and an analysis of variance was conducted. Cross-sectional images of the specimens were studied to observe the changes in the mesostructure of the specimens that led to the increase in inter-laminar strength of the parts. The results show that temperature plays a dominant role in increasing the ultimate tensile strength and an 89% increase in the average ultimate tensile strength was seen corresponding to an annealing temperature of 160 °C. A change in the mesostructure of the parts is seen, which is characterized by an increase in bond length and void coalescence. These results can be helpful in studying the structural strength of 3D printed parts, and thus could eventually guide the fabrication of components with strength comparable to those of conventional manufacturing techniques.},

ABSTRACT = {A 3D thermal response model is developed to evaluate the thermal behavior of glass fiber/phenolic composite exposed to heat flux on one side. The model is built upon heat transfer and energy conservation equations in which the heat transfer is in the form of anisotropic heat conduction, absorption by matrix decomposition, and diffusion of gas. Arrhenius equation is used to characterize the pyrolysis reaction of the materials. The diffusion equation for the decomposition gas is included for mass conservation. The temperature, density, decomposition degree, and rate are extracted to analyze the process of material decomposition, which is implemented by using the UMATHT (User subroutine to define a material’s thermal behavior) and USDFLD (User subroutine to redefine field variables) subroutines via ABAQUS code. By comparing the analysis results with experimental data, it is found that the model is valid to simulate the evolution of a glass fiber/phenolic composite exposed to heat flux from one side. The comparison also shows that longer time is taken to complete the pyrolysis reaction with increasing depth for materials from the numerical simulation, and the char region and the pyrolysis reaction region enlarge further with increasing time. Furthermore, the decomposition degree and temperature are correlated with depths, as well as the peak value of decomposition rate and the time to reach the peak value.},

ABSTRACT = {The design of advanced nanostructured materials with predetermined physical properties requires knowledge of the relationship between these properties and the internal structure of the material at the nanoscale, as well as the dependence of the internal structure on the production (synthesis) parameters. This work is the first report of computer-aided analysis of high pressure consolidation (cold sintering) of bimetallic nanoparticles of two immiscible (Fe and Cu) metals using the embedded atom method (EAM). A detailed study of the effect of cold sintering parameters on the internal structure and properties of bulk Fe–Cu nanocomposites was conducted within the limitations of the numerical model. The variation of estimated density and bulk porosity as a function of Fe-to-Cu ratio and consolidation pressure was found in good agreement with the experimental data. For the first time, topological analysis using Minkowski functionals was applied to characterize the internal structure of a bimetallic nanocomposite. The dependence of topological invariants on input processing parameters was described for various components and structural phases. The model presented allows formalizing the relationship between the internal structure and properties of the studied nanocomposites. Based on the obtained topological invariants and Hadwiger’s theorem we propose a new tool for computer-aided design of bimetallic Fe–Cu nanocomposites.},

ABSTRACT = {Cellulose nanofiber (CNF) exhibits excellent mechanical properties, which has been extensively proven through experimental techniques. However, understanding the mechanisms and the inherent structural behavior of cellulose is important in its vastly growing research areas of applications. This study focuses on taking a look into what happens to the atomic molecular interactions of CNF, mainly hydrogen bond, in the presence of external force. This paper investigates the hydrogen bond disparity within CNF structure. To achieve this, molecular dynamics simulations of cellulose I β nanofibers are carried out in equilibrated conditions in water using GROMACS software in conjunction with OPLS-AA force field. It is noted that the hydrogen bonds within the CNF are disrupted when a pulling force is applied. The simulated Young’s modulus of CNF is found to be 161 GPa. A simulated shear within the cellulose chains presents a trend with more hydrogen bond disruptions at higher forces.},

ABSTRACT = {A four-noded finite element of a moderately thick plate made of functionally graded material (FGM) is presented. The base element is rectangular and can be extended to any shape using a transformation based on NURBS functions. The proposed 2D shape functions are consistent with the physical interpretation and describe the states of element displacement caused by unit displacements of nodes. These functions depend on the FGM’s material parameters and are called material-oriented. The shape function matrix is based on a superposition displacement field of two plate strips with 1D exact shape functions. A characteristic feature of the proposed formulation is full coupling of the membrane and bending states in the plate. The analytical form of the stiffness matrix and the nodal load vector was obtained, which leads to the numerical efficiency of the formulation. The element has been incorporated into Abaqus software with the use of Maple program. The finite element shows good convergence properties for different FGM models in the transverse direction to the middle plane of the plate. During derivation of the 2D plate element the formally exact 1D finite element for transverse nonhomogeneous FGM plate strip was developed.},

ABSTRACT = {A spatial computational model of a motor vehicle disc brake, based on the system of equations of heat dynamics of friction and wear (HDFW), was developed. The interrelations of temperature-dependent coefficient of friction and coefficient of intensity of wear through the contact temperature and vehicle velocity were taken into account. The solution of the system of equations of HDFW was obtained by the finite element method (FEM) for six different brake pad materials associated with the cast-iron disc during a single braking. Changes in the braking time, coefficient of friction, braking torque, vehicle velocity, mean temperature of the contact area of the pads with the disc and wear of the friction surfaces were determined. Then, the obtained calculation results were evaluated in terms of stabilization of the coefficient of friction (braking torque), as well as minimization of the maximum temperature, wear, braking time and pads mass. As a result, recommendations were given to select optimum brake pad material in combination with a cast-iron disc.},

ABSTRACT = {To manufacture custom medical parts or scaffolds with reduced defects and high mechanical characteristics, new research on optimizing the selective laser melting (SLM) parameters are needed. In this work, a biocompatible powder, 316L stainless steel, is characterized to understand the particle size, distribution, shape and flowability. Examination revealed that the 316L particles are smooth, nearly spherical, their mean diameter is 39.09 μm and just 10% of them hold a diameter less than 21.18 μm. SLM parameters under consideration include laser power up to 200 W, 250–1500 mm/s scanning speed, 80 μm hatch spacing, 35 μm layer thickness and a preheated platform. The effect of these on processability is evaluated. More than 100 samples are SLM-manufactured with different process parameters. The tensile results show that is possible to raise the ultimate tensile strength up to 840 MPa, adapting the SLM parameters for a stable processability, avoiding the technological defects caused by residual stress. Correlating with other recent studies on SLM technology, the tensile strength is 20% improved. To validate the SLM parameters and conditions established, complex bioengineering applications such as dental bridges and macro-porous grafts are SLM-processed, demonstrating the potential to manufacture medical products with increased mechanical resistance made of 316L.},

ABSTRACT = {Starch agglomerates are widely applied in the pharmaceutical, agricultural, and food industries. The formation of potato starch tablets and their diametral compression were simulated numerically and verified in a laboratory experiment to analyse the microscopic mechanisms of the compaction and the origins of their breakage strength. Discrete element method (DEM) simulations were performed using EDEM software. Samples comprised of 120,000 spherical particles with radii normally distributed in the range of 5–36 μm were compacted in a cylindrical die with a diameter of 2.5 cm. The linear elastic–plastic constitutive contact model with a parallel bonded-particle model (BPM) was used to model the diametral compression. DEM simulations indicated that the BPM, together with the linear elastic–plastic contact model, could describe the brittle, semi-brittle, or ductile breakage mode, depending on the ratio of the strength to Young’s modulus of the bond and the bond-to-contact elasticity ratio. Experiments confirmed the findings of the DEM simulations and indicated that potato starch (PS) agglomerates can behave as a brittle, semi-brittle, or ductile material, depending on the applied binder. The PS agglomerates without any additives behaved as a semi-brittle material. The addition of 5% of ground sugar resulted in the brittle breakage mode. The addition of 5% gluten resulted in the ductile breakage mode.},

ABSTRACT = {Additive manufacturing (AM) is today in the main focus—and not only in commercial production. Products with complex geometry can be built using various AM techniques, which include laser sintering of metal powder. Although the technique has been known for a quite long time, the impact of the morphology of individual powder particles on the process has not yet been adequately documented. This article presents a detailed microscopic analysis of virgin and reused powder particles of MS1 maraging steel. The metallographic observation was performed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The particle size of the individual powder particles was measured in the SEM and the particle surface morphology and its change in the reused powder were observed. Individual particles were analyzed in detail using an SEM with a focused ion beam (FIB) milling capability. The powder particles were gradually cut off in thin layers so that their internal structure, chemical element distribution, possible internal defects, and shape could be monitored. Elemental distribution and phase distribution were analyzed using EDS and EBSD, respectively. Our findings lead to a better understanding and prediction of defects in additive-manufactured products. This could be helpful not just in the AM field, but in any metal powder-based processes, such as metal injection molding, powder metallurgy, spray deposition processes, and others.},

ABSTRACT = {Concrete filled steel tubes (CFSTs) show advantageous applications in the field of construction, especially for a high axial load capacity. The challenge in using such structure lies in the selection of many parameters constituting CFST, which necessitates defining complex relationships between the components and the corresponding properties. The axial capacity (Pu) of CFST is among the most important mechanical properties. In this study, the possibility of using a feedforward neural network (FNN) to predict Pu was investigated. Furthermore, an evolutionary optimization algorithm, namely invasive weed optimization (IWO), was used for tuning and optimizing the FNN weights and biases to construct a hybrid FNN–IWO model and improve its prediction performance. The results showed that the FNN–IWO algorithm is an excellent predictor of Pu, with a value of R2 of up to 0.979. The advantage of FNN–IWO was also pointed out with the gains in accuracy of 47.9%, 49.2%, and 6.5% for root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and R2, respectively, compared with simulation using the single FNN. Finally, the performance in predicting the Pu in the function of structural parameters such as depth/width ratio, thickness of steel tube, yield stress of steel, concrete compressive strength, and slenderness ratio was investigated and discussed.},

For the evaluation of the adhesive strength of the free-standing Ti3C2Tz-based film, the model comprised single-layered MXene nanosheets with a specific number of individual flakes, and the reverse engineering method with a curve fitting approach was used. The interlaminar shear strength, in-plane stiffness, and shear energy release rate of MXene film were predicted using this approach. The results of the sensitivity analysis showed that interlaminar shear strength and in-plane stiffness have the largest influence on the mechanical behavior of MXene film under tension, while the shear energy release rate mainly affects the interlaminar damage properties of nanosheets.},

ABSTRACT = {Constitutive models for plastic deformation of metals are typically based on flow rules determining the transition from elastic to plastic response of a material as function of the applied mechanical load. These flow rules are commonly formulated as a yield function, based on the equivalent stress and the yield strength of the material, and its derivatives. In this work, a novel mathematical formulation is developed that allows the efficient use of machine learning algorithms describing the elastic-plastic deformation of a solid under arbitrary mechanical loads and that can replace the standard yield functions with more flexible algorithms. By exploiting basic physical principles of elastic-plastic deformation, the dimensionality of the problem is reduced without loss of generality. The data-oriented approach inherently offers a great flexibility to handle different kinds of material anisotropy without the need for explicitly calculating a large number of model parameters. The applicability of this formulation in finite element analysis is demonstrated, and the results are compared to formulations based on Hill-like anisotropic plasticity as reference model. In future applications, the machine learning algorithm can be trained by hybrid experimental and numerical data, as for example obtained from fundamental micromechanical simulations based on crystal plasticity models. In this way, data-oriented constitutive modeling will also provide a new way to homogenize numerical results in a scale-bridging approach.},

ABSTRACT = {Machining of metals is an essential operation in the manufacturing industry. Chip formation in metal cutting is associated with large plastic strains, large deformations, high strain rates and high temperatures, mainly located in the primary and in the secondary shear zones. During the last decades, there has been significant progress in numerical methods and constitutive modeling for machining operations. In this work, the Particle Finite Element Method (PFEM) together with a dislocation density (DD) constitutive model are introduced to simulate the machining of Ti-6Al-4V. The work includes a study of two constitutive models for the titanium material, the physically based plasticity DD model and the phenomenology based Johnson–Cook model. Both constitutive models were implemented into an in-house PFEM software and setup to simulate deformation behaviour of titanium Ti6Al4V during an orthogonal cutting process. Validation show that numerical and experimental results are in agreement for different cutting speeds and feeds. The dislocation density model, although it needs more thorough calibration, shows an excellent match with the results. This paper shows that the combination of PFEM together with a dislocation density constitutive model is an excellent candidate for future numerical simulations of mechanical cutting.},

ABSTRACT = {Blast resistant gates/doors are essential for sensitive infrastructure, such as embassies, ministries, or parliaments. Lightweight gates equipped with ‘energy absorbing systems’ have better operational performance than the traditional costly and bulky design. Graded auxetic structures have not yet been used as potential passive damping systems in the supporting frame of blast resistant gates. Consequently, this study tries to test if a uniaxial graded auxetic damper (UGAD) proposed by the authors in a recent article, namely the development of a new shock absorbing UGAD, could maintain a 3000 mm × 4500 mm steel gate operable after high blast peak reflected overpressure of 6.6 MPa, from 100 kg TNT at 5 m stand-off distance. The blast-induced response of the gate was assessed, with and without the proposed UGAD, using Abaqus/Explicit solver. Results showed that the attachment of the proposed UGAD to the gate led to a dramatic decrease in permanent deformations (a critical factor for gate operability after a blast event). Hence, a lighter, more economical gate (with 50% reduction in mass) was required to satisfy the operability condition. In addition, 49% of peak reaction forces were diminished, that have a direct impact on the supporting frame. Moreover, the results revealed that, in the numerical model, 56% of the achieved plastic dissipation energy was from the UGADs, and 44% from the gate. The outcomes of this research may have a positive impact on other sectors beyond academia, such as industry, economy, and public safety.},

ABSTRACT = {Tungsten carbide-cobalt (WC-Co) composites are a class of advanced materials that have unique properties, such as wear resistance, hardness, strength, fracture-toughness and both high temperature and chemical stability. It is well known that the local indentation properties (i.e., nano- and micro-hardness) of the single crystal WC particles dispersed in such composite materials are highly anisotropic. In this paper, the nanoindentation response of the WC grains of a compact, full-density, sintered WC-10Co composite material has been investigated as a function of the crystal orientation. Our nanoindentation survey has shown that the nanohardness was distributed according to a bimodal function. This function was post-processed using the unique features of the finite mixture modelling theory. The combination of electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) and statistical analysis has made it possible to identify the orientation of the WC crystal and the distinct association of the inherent nanoindentation properties, even for a small set (67) of nanoindentations. The proposed approach has proved to be faster than the already existing ones and just as reliable, and it has confirmed the previous findings concerning the relationship between crystal orientation and indentation properties, but with a significant reduction of the experimental data.},

ABSTRACT = {Laser beam-based deposition methods such as laser cladding or additive manufacturing of metals promises improved properties, performance, and reliability of the materials and therefore rely heavily on understanding the relationship between chemical composition, rapid solidification processing conditions, and resulting microstructural features. In this work, the phase formation of four Ni-Cr-Si alloys was studied as a function of cooling rate and chemical composition using a liquid droplet rapid solidification technique. Post mortem x-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and in situ synchrotron microbeam X-ray diffraction shows the present and evolution of the rapidly solidified microstructures. Furthermore, the obtained results were compared to standard laser deposition tests. In situ microbeam diffraction revealed that due to rapid cooling and an increasing amount of Cr and Si, metastable high-temperature silicides remain in the final microstructure. Due to more sluggish interface kinetics of intermetallic compounds than that of disorder solid solution, an anomalous eutectic structure becomes dominant over the regular lamellar microstructure at high cooling rates. The rapid solidification experiments produced a microstructure similar to the one generated in laser coating thus confirming that this rapid solidification test allows a rapid pre-screening of alloys suitable for laser beam-based processing techniques.},

ABSTRACT = {When a thick laminate is subjected to bending, under certain boundary conditions, wrinkles may appear and develop due to the inextensibility of the fibers. Wrinkling is one of the most critical defects in composite manufacturing. Numerical simulation of the onset and growth of such wrinkles is an important tool for defining optimal process parameters. Herein, several bending experiments of thick laminates are presented. They were found to lead to severe wrinkling and delamination of different kinds. It is shown that the history of loading changed the developed wrinkles. Stress resultant shell finite elements specific to textile reinforcement forming show their relevance to provide, for these wrinkles induced by bending, results in good agreement with the experiments, both with regard to the onset of the wrinkles and to their development. This numerical approach was used to improve the understanding of the phenomena involved in wrinkling and to define the conditions required to avoid it in a given process.},

ABSTRACT = {The rapid growth of Additive Manufacturing (AM) in the past decade has demonstrated a significant potential in cost-effective production with a superior quality product. A numerical simulation is a steep way to learn and improve the product quality, life cycle, and production cost. To cope with the growing AM field, researchers are exploring different techniques, methods, models to simulate the AM process efficiently. The goal is to develop a thermo-mechanical weld model for the Directed Energy Deposition (DED) process for 316L stainless steel at an efficient computational cost targeting to model large AM parts in residual stress calculation. To adapt the weld model to the DED simulation, single and multi-track thermal simulations were carried out. Numerical results were validated by the DED experiment. A good agreement was found between predicted temperature trends for numerical simulation and experimental results. A large number of weld tracks in the 3D solid AM parts make the finite element process simulation challenging in terms of computational time and large amounts of data management. The method of activating elements layer by layer and introducing heat in a cyclic manner called a thermal cycle heat input was applied. Thermal cycle heat input reduces the computational time considerably. The numerical results were compared to the experimental data for thermal and residual stress analyses. A lumping of layers strategy was implemented to reduce further computational time. The different number of lumping layers was analyzed to define the limit of lumping to retain accuracy in the residual stress calculation. The lumped layers residual stress calculation was validated by the contour cut method in the deposited sample. Thermal behavior and residual stress prediction for the different numbers of a lumped layer were examined and reported computational time reduction.},

ABSTRACT = {The effect of Nb content on microstructure, mechanical properties and superelasticity was investigated for a series of Ti-xNb alloys, fabricated by the laser engineered net shaping method, using elemental Ti and Nb powders. The microstructure of as-deposited materials consisted of columnar β-phase grains, elongated in the built direction. However, due to the presence of undissolved Nb particles during the deposition process, an additional heat treatment was necessary. The observed changes in mechanical properties were explained in relation to the phase constituents and deformation mechanisms. Due to the elevated oxygen content in the investigated materials (2 at.%), the specific deformation mechanisms were observed at lower Nb content in comparison to the conventionally fabricated materials. This made it possible to conclude that oxygen increases the stability of the β phase in β–Ti alloys. For the first time, superelasticity was observed in Ti–Nb-based alloys fabricated by the additive manufacturing method. The highest recoverable strain of 3% was observed in Ti–19Nb alloy as a result of high elasticity and reverse martensitic transformation stress-induced during the loading.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, the effects of different hydrophobic coatings on the surface of covered electrodes on the quality of wet welded carbon steel joints were discussed. Commonly available hydrophobic substances used in industrial applications were selected for the research. The aim of using waterproof coatings was to check the possibility to decreasing the susceptibility of high-strength low-alloy S460N steel to cold cracking. During experiments diffusible hydrogen content in deposited metal determination by mercury method, metallographic macro- and microscopic testing and hardness measurements were performed. Investigations showed that waterproof coatings laid on covered electrodes can improve the quality of wet welded joints, by decreasing the Vickers HV10 hardness in heat-affected zone and decreasing the diffusible hydrogen content in deposited metal, which minimalize possibility of cold cracking.},

ABSTRACT = {The contour scan strategies in laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) of Ti-6Al-4V were studied at the coupon level. These scan strategies determined the surface qualities and subsurface residual stresses. The correlations to these properties were identified for an optimization of the LPBF processing. The surface roughness and the residual stresses in build direction were linked: combining high laser power and high scan velocities with at least two contour lines substantially reduced the surface roughness, expressed by the arithmetic mean height, from values as high as 30 µm to 13 µm, while the residual stresses rose from ~340 to about 800 MPa. At this stress level, manufactured rocket fuel injector components evidenced macroscopic cracking. A scan strategy completing the contour region at 100 W and 1050 mm/s is recommended as a compromise between residual stresses (625 MPa) and surface quality (14.2 µm). The LPBF builds were monitored with an in-line twin-photodiode-based melt pool monitoring (MPM) system, which revealed a correlation between the intensity quotient I2/I1, the surface roughness, and the residual stresses. Thus, this MPM system can provide a predictive estimate of the surface quality of the samples and resulting residual stresses in the material generated during LPBF.},

ABSTRACT = {Three-dimensional (3D) printing continuous carbon fiber-reinforced polylactic acid (PLA) composites offer excellent tensile mechanical properties. The present study aimed to research the effect of process parameters on the tensile mechanical properties of 3D printing composite specimens through a series of mechanical experiments. The main printing parameters, including layer height, extrusion width, printing temperature, and printing speed are changed to manufacture specimens based on the modified fused filament fabrication 3D printer, and the tensile mechanical properties of 3D printing continuous carbon fiber-reinforced PLA composites are presented. By comparing the outcomes of experiments, the results show that relative fiber content has a significant impact on mechanical properties and the ratio of carbon fibers in composites is influenced by layer height and extrusion width. The tensile mechanical properties of continuous carbon fiber-reinforced composites gradually decrease with an increase of layer height and extrusion width. In addition, printing temperature and speed also affect the fiber matrix interface, i.e., tensile mechanical properties increase as the printing temperature rises, while the tensile mechanical properties decrease when the printing speed increases. Furthermore, the strengthening mechanism on the tensile mechanical properties is that external loads subjected to the components can be transferred to the carbon fibers through the fiber-matrix interface. Additionally, SEM images suggest that the main weakness of continuous carbon fiber-reinforced 3D printing composites exists in the fiber-matrix interface, and the main failure is the pull-out of the fiber caused by the interface destruction.},

ABSTRACT = {The design of advanced alloys specifically tailored to additive manufacturing processes is a research field that is attracting ever-increasing attention. Laser powder-bed fusion (LPBF) commonly uses pre-alloyed, fine powders (diameter usually 15–45 µm) to produce fully dense metallic parts. The availability of such fine, pre-alloyed powders reduces the iteration speed of alloy development for LPBF and renders it quite costly. Here, we overcome these drawbacks by performing in-situ alloying in LPBF starting with pure elemental powder mixtures avoiding the use of costly pre-alloyed powders. Pure iron, chromium, and nickel powder mixtures were used to perform in-situ alloying to manufacture 304 L stainless steel cube-shaped samples. Process parameters including scanning speed, laser power, beam diameter, and layer thickness were varied aiming at obtaining a chemically homogeneous alloy. The scientific questions focused on in this work are: which process parameters are required for producing such samples (in part already known in the state of the art), and why are these parameters conducive to homogeneity? Analytical modelling of the melt pool geometry and temperature field suggests that the residence time in the liquid state is the most important parameter controlling the chemical homogeneity of the parts. Results show that in-situ alloying can be successfully employed to enable faster and cost-efficient rapid alloy development.},

ABSTRACT = {In this study, a computational procedure for the investigation of the vibration behavior of laminated composite structures, including graphene inclusions in the matrix, is developed. Concerning the size-dependent behavior of graphene, its mechanical properties are derived using nanoscopic empiric equations. Using the appropriate Halpin-Tsai models, the equivalent elastic constants of the graphene reinforced matrix are obtained. Then, the orthotropic mechanical properties of a composite lamina of carbon fibers and hybrid matrix can be evaluated. Considering a specific stacking sequence and various geometric configurations, carbon fiber-graphene-reinforced hybrid composite plates are modeled using conventional finite element techniques. Applying simply support or clamped boundary conditions, the vibrational behavior of the composite structures are finally extracted. Specifically, the modes of vibration for every configuration are derived, as well as the effect of graphene inclusions in the natural frequencies, is calculated. The higher the volume fraction of graphene in the matrix, the higher the natural frequency for every mode. Comparisons with other methods, where it is possible, are performed for the validation of the proposed method.},

ABSTRACT = {While repair is mainly used to restore the original part geometry and properties, hybrid manufacturing aims to exploit the benefits of each respective manufacturing process regarding either processing itself or resulting part characteristics. Especially with the current implementation of additive manufacturing in the production of TiAl, turbine blades for both hybrid manufacturing and repair new opportunities are enabled. One main issue is the compatibility of the two or more material types involved, which either differ regarding composition or microstructure or both. In this study, a TNMTM-alloy (Ti-Nb-Mo) was manufactured by different processes (casting, forging, laser additive manufacturing) and identically heat-treated at 1290 °C. Chemical compositions, especially aluminum and oxygen contents, were measured, and the resulting microstructures were analyzed with Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and High-energy X-ray diffraction (HEXRD). The properties were determined by hardness measurements and high-temperature compression tests. The comparison led to an overall assessment of the theoretical compatibility. Experiments to combine several processes were performed to evaluate the practical feasibility. Despite obvious differences in the final phase distribution caused by deviations in the chemical composition, the measured properties of the samples did not differ significantly. The feasibility of combining direct energy deposition (DED) with either casting or laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) was demonstrated by the successful build of the dense, crack-free hybrid material.},

ABSTRACT = {It is widely known that the printing quality of fused filament fabrication (FFF) is heavily affected by environmental temperature and humidity, taking the form of warping and porosity. However, there is little understanding about the quantitative relations between environmental conditions, geometry, and the mechanical properties of printed parts. In this study, we systematically investigated those relations using bisphenol A polycarbonate as a model material system. For the environmental temperature, an in-situ infrared imaging analysis revealed the presence of an up to 5.4 °C/mm thermal gradient when printing using an open-chamber printer and a heated build plate. For the environmental humidity, an analysis of X-ray micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) scans showed an up to 11.7% porosity that was brought by polymer water content absorbed from environmental moisture. Meanwhile, tensile tests showed a mechanical performance loss associated with those defects, but, surprisingly, the transverse direction ductility had the potential to increase at a higher porosity. Furthermore, the experimental results were combined with analytical and parametrical studies to elucidate quantitative relations between environmental conditions and printing quality. Based on the results, quantitative guidelines for the estimation of printing quality based on environmental conditions are provided that would also help users to obtain desired printing results with a better understanding of the effects of environmental conditions.},

ABSTRACT = {Noise has a negative impact on our environment and human health. For this reason, it is necessary to eliminate excessive noise levels. This paper is focused on the study of the sound absorption properties of materials with open-porous structures, which were made of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) material using additive technology. Four types of structures (Cartesian, Octagonal, Rhomboid, and Starlit) were evaluated in this work, and every structure was prepared in three different volume ratios of the porosity and three different thicknesses. The sound absorption properties of the investigated ABS specimens were examined utilizing the normal incidence sound absorption and noise reduction coefficients, which were experimentally determined by the transfer function method using a two-microphone acoustic impedance tube. This work deals with various factors that influence the sound absorption performance of four different types of investigated ABS material’s structures. It was found, in this study, that the sound absorption performance of the investigated ABS specimens is strongly affected by different factors, specifically by the structure geometry, material volume ratio, excitation frequency of an acoustic wave, material’s thickness, and air space size behind the tested sound-absorbing materials.},

ABSTRACT = {Herein, an approach is proposed to analyze the tortuosity of porous electrodes using the radical Voronoi tessellation. For this purpose, a series of particle compacts geometrically similar to the actual porous electrode were generated using discrete element method; the radical Voronoi tessellation was constructed for each compact to characterize the structural properties; the tortuosity of compact porous structure was simulated by applying the Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm on radical Voronoi tessellation. Finally, the relationships were established between the tortuosity and the composition of the ternary particle mixture, and between the tortuosity and the radical Voronoi cell parameters. The following correlations between tortuosity values and radical Voronoi cell parameters were found: larger faces and longer edges of radical Voronoi cell leads to the increased fraction of larger values of tortuosity in the distribution, while smaller faces and shorter edges of radical Voronoi cell contribute to the increased fraction of smaller tortuosity values, being the tortuosity values more uniform with narrower distribution. Thus, the compacts with enhanced diffusion properties are expected to be obtained by packing particle mixtures with high volume fraction of small and medium particles. These results will help to design the well-packed particle compacts having improved diffusion properties for various applications including porous electrodes.},

ABSTRACT = {Fibre reinforced plastics have tailorable and superior mechanical characteristics compared to metals and can be used to construct relevant components such as primary crash structures for automobiles. However, the absence of standardized methodologies to predict component level damage has led to their underutilization as compared to their metallic counterparts, which are used extensively to manufacture primary crash structures. This paper presents a methodology that uses crashworthiness results from in-plane impact tests, conducted on carbon-fibre reinforced epoxy flat plates, to tune the related material card in Radioss using two different parametric identification techniques: global and adaptive response search methods. The resulting virtual material model was then successfully validated by comparing the crushing behavior with results obtained from experiments that were conducted by impacting a Formula SAE (Society of Automotive Engineers) crash box. Use of automated identification techniques significantly reduces the development time of composite crash structures, whilst the predictive capability reduces the need for component level tests, thereby making the development process more efficient, automated and economical, thereby reducing the cost of development using composite materials. This in turn promotes the development of vehicles that meet safety standards with lower mass and noxious gas emissions.},

ABSTRACT = {Compositionally graded cylinders of Ti–Mn alloys were produced using the Laser Engineered Net Shaping (LENS™) technique, with Mn content varying from 0 to 12 wt.% along the cylinder axis. The cylinders were subjected to different post-build heat treatments to produce a large sample library of α–β microstructures. The microstructures in the sample library were studied using back-scattered electron (BSE) imaging in a scanning electron microscope (SEM), and their mechanical properties were evaluated using spherical indentation stress–strain protocols. These protocols revealed that the microstructures exhibited features with averaged chord lengths in the range of 0.17–1.78 μm, and beta content in the range of 20–83 vol.%. The estimated values of the Young’s moduli and tensile yield strengths from spherical indentation were found to vary in the ranges of 97–130 GPa and 828–1864 MPa, respectively. The combined use of the LENS technique along with the spherical indentation protocols was found to facilitate the rapid exploration of material and process spaces. Analyses of the correlations between the process conditions, several key microstructural features, and the measured material properties were performed via Gaussian process regression (GPR). These data-driven statistical models provided valuable insights into the underlying correlations between these variables.},

Theoretical X-ray diffraction analyses showed that the peak (at 2θ = 30.4°) shifts to a larger angle (at 2θ = 31.9°) when the average fraction of the incorporated Cl increased. The energy bandgap (Eg) was observed to increase with the increase in Cl concentration. For x = 0.00, 0.25, 0.33, 0.50, 0.66, 0.75, and 1.00, the Eg values calculated using the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof potential were between 1.53 and 1.93 eV, while those calculated using the modified Becke−Johnson generalized gradient approximation (mBJ–GGA) potential were between 2.23 and 2.90 eV. The Eg calculated using the mBJ–GGA method best matched the experimental values reported. The effective masses decreased with a concentration increase of Cl to 0.33 and then increased with a further increase in the concentration of Cl. Calculated photoabsorption coefficients show a blue shift of absorption at higher Cl content. The calculations indicate that CsPb(Br1−xClx)3 perovskite could be used in optical and optoelectronic devices by partly replacing bromide with chloride.},

ABSTRACT = {The material properties of thermoplastic polymer parts manufactured by the extrusion-based additive manufacturing process are highly dependent on the thermal history. Different numerical models have been proposed to simulate the thermal history of a 3D-printed part. However, they are limited due to limited geometric applicability; low accuracy; or high computational demand. Can the time–temperature history of a 3D-printed part be simulated by a computationally less demanding, fast numerical model without losing accuracy? This paper describes the numerical implementation of a simplified discrete-event simulation model that offers accuracy comparable to a finite element model but is faster by two orders of magnitude. Two polymer systems with distinct thermal properties were selected to highlight differences in the simulation of the orthotropic response and the temperature-dependent material properties. The time–temperature histories from the numerical model were compared to the time–temperature histories from a conventional finite element model and were found to match closely. The proposed highly parallel numerical model was approximately 300–500 times faster in simulating thermal history compared to the conventional finite element model. The model would enable designers to compare the effects of several printing parameters for specific 3D-printed parts and select the most suitable parameters for the part.},

ABSTRACT = {The aim of this work is to simulate the fragmentation of bullets impacted through granular media, in this case, sand. In order to validate the simulation, a group of experiments were conducted with the sand contained in two different box prototypes. The walls of the first box were constructed with fiberglass and the second with plywood. The prototypes were subjected to the impact force of bullets fired 15 m away from the box. After the shots, X-ray photographs were taken to observe the penetration depth. Transient numerical analyses were conducted to simulate these physical phenomena by using the smooth particle hydrodynamics (SPH) module of ANSYS® 2019 AUTODYN software. Advantageously, this module considers the granular media as a group of uniform particles capable of transferring kinetic energy during the elastic collision component of an impact. The experimental results demonstrated a reduction in the maximum bullet kinetic energy of 2750 J to 100 J in 0.8 ms. The numerical results compared with the X-ray photographs showed similar results demonstrating the capability of sand to dissipate kinetic energy and the fragmentation of the bullet caused at the moment of impact.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, a comparison of the mechanical properties of high-strength low-alloy S460N steel welded joints is presented. The welded joints were made by the gas metal arc welding (GMAW) process in the air environment and water, by the local cavity welding method. Welded joints were tested following the EN ISO 15614-1:2017 standard. After welding, the non-destructive—visual, penetrant, radiographic, and ultrasonic (phased array) tests were performed. In the next step, the destructive tests, as static tensile-, bending-, impact- metallographic (macroscopic and microscopic) tests, and Vickers HV10 measurements were made. The influence of weld porosity on the mechanical properties of the tested joints was also assessed. The performed tests showed that the tensile strength of the joints manufactured in water (567 MPa) could be similar to the air welded joint (570 MPa). The standard deviations from the measurements were—47 MPa in water and 33 MPa in the air. However, it was also stated that in the case of a complex state of stress, for example, bending, torsional and tensile stresses, the welding imperfections (e.g., pores) significantly decrease the properties of the welded joint. In areas characterized by porosity the tensile strength decreased to 503 MPa. Significant differences were observed for bending tests. During the bending of the underwater welded joint, a smaller bending angle broke the specimen than was the case during the air welded joint bending. Also, the toughness and hardness of joints obtained in both environments were different. The minimum toughness for specimens welded in water was 49 J (in the area characterized by high porosity) and in the air it was 125 J (with a standard deviation of 23 J). The hardness in the heat-affected zone (HAZ) for the underwater joint in the non-tempered area was above 400 HV10 (with a standard deviation of 37 HV10) and for the air joint below 300 HV10 (with a standard deviation of 17 HV10). The performed investigations showed the behavior of S460N steel, which is characterized by a high value of carbon equivalent (CeIIW) 0.464%, during local cavity welding.},

ABSTRACT = {Nonlinear finite element (FE) analysis of reinforced concrete (RC) structures is characterized by numerous modeling options and input parameters. To accurately model the nonlinear RC behavior involving concrete cracking in tension and crushing in compression, practitioners make different choices regarding the critical modeling issues, e.g., defining the concrete constitutive relations, assigning the bond between the concrete and the steel reinforcement, and solving problems related to convergence difficulties and mesh sensitivities. Thus, it is imperative to review the common modeling choices critically and develop a robust modeling strategy with consistency, reliability, and comparability. This paper proposes a modeling strategy and practical recommendations for the nonlinear FE analysis of RC structures based on parametric studies of critical modeling choices. The proposed modeling strategy aims at providing reliable predictions of flexural responses of RC members with a focus on concrete cracking behavior and crushing failure, which serve as the foundation for more complex modeling cases, e.g., RC beams bonded with fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) laminates. Additionally, herein, the implementation procedure for the proposed modeling strategy is comprehensively described with a focus on the critical modeling issues for RC structures. The proposed strategy is demonstrated through FE analyses of RC beams tested in four-point bending—one RC beam as reference and one beam externally bonded with a carbon-FRP (CFRP) laminate in its soffit. The simulated results agree well with experimental measurements regarding load-deformation relationship, cracking, flexural failure due to concrete crushing, and CFRP debonding initiated by intermediate cracks. The modeling strategy and recommendations presented herein are applicable to the nonlinear FE analysis of RC structures in general.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, the dynamics of multi-dendrite concurrent growth and coarsening of an Al-15 wt.% Cu alloy was studied using a highly computationally efficient 3D phase field model and real-time synchrotron X-ray micro-tomography. High fidelity multi-dendrite simulations were achieved and the results were compared directly with the time-evolved tomography datasets to quantify the relative importance of multi-dendritic growth and coarsening. Coarsening mechanisms under different solidification conditions were further elucidated. The dominant coarsening mechanisms change from small arm melting and interdendritic groove advancement to coalescence when the solid volume fraction approaches ~0.70. Both tomography experiments and phase field simulations indicated that multi-dendrite coarsening obeys the classical Lifshitz–Slyozov–Wagner theory Rn−R0n = kc(t−t0), but with a higher constant of n = 4.3.},

ABSTRACT = {Lath martensite is a complex hierarchical compound structure that forms during rapid cooling of carbon steels from the austenitic phase. At the smallest, i.e., ‘single crystal’ scale, individual, elongated domains, form the elemental microstructural building blocks: the name-giving laths. Several laths of nearly identical crystallographic orientation are grouped together to blocks, in which–depending on the exact material characteristics–clearly distinguishable subblocks might be observed. Several blocks with the same habit plane together form a packet of which typically three to four together finally make up the former parent austenitic grain. Here, a fully parametrized approach is presented which converts an austenitic polycrystal representation into martensitic microstructures incorporating all these details. Two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) Representative Volume Elements (RVEs) are generated based on prior austenite microstructure reconstructed from a 2D experimental martensitic microstructure. The RVEs are used for high-resolution crystal plasticity simulations with a fast spectral method-based solver and a phenomenological constitutive description. The comparison of the results obtained from the 2D experimental microstructure and the 2D RVEs reveals a high quantitative agreement. The stress and strain distributions and their characteristics change significantly if 3D microstructures are used. Further simulations are conducted to systematically investigate the influence of microstructural parameters, such as lath aspect ratio, lath volume, subblock thickness, orientation scatter, and prior austenitic grain shape on the global and local mechanical behavior. These microstructural features happen to change the local mechanical behavior, whereas the average stress–strain response is not significantly altered. Correlations between the microstructure and the plastic behavior are established.},

ABSTRACT = {Herein, the influence of the substrate in the formation of zirconium oxide monolayer, from an aqueous hexafluorozirconic acid solution, by chemical conversion and by electro-assisted deposition, has been approached. The nanoscale dimensions of the ZrO2 film is affected by the substrate nature and roughness. This study evidenced that the mechanism of Zr-EAD is dependent on the potential applied and on the substrate composition, whereas conversion coating is uniquely dependent on the adsorption reaction time. The zirconium oxide based nanofilms were more homogenous in AA2024 substrates if compared to pure Al grade (AA1100). It was justified by the high content of Cu alloying element present in the grain boundaries of the latter. Such intermetallic active sites favor the obtaining of ZrO2 films, as demonstrated by XPS and AFM results. From a mechanistic point of view, the electrochemical reactions take place simultaneously with the conventional chemical conversion process driven by ions diffusion. Such findings will bring new perspectives for the generation of controlled oxide coatings in modified electrodes used, as for example, in the construction of battery cells; in automotive and in aerospace industries, to replace micrometric layers of zinc phosphate by light-weight zirconium oxide nanometric ones. This study is particularly addressed for the reduction of industrial waste by applying green bath solutions without the need of auxiliary compounds and using lightweight ceramic materials.},

ABSTRACT = {Extrusion-based three-dimensional (3D) printing methods are preferred and emerging approaches for freely digital fabrication of ceramics due to ease of use, low investment, high utilization of materials, and good adaptability to multi-materials. However, systematic knowledge still lacks an explanation for what is their 3D printability. Moreover, some uncontrollable factors including extrudate shape retention and nonuniform drying inevitably limit their industrial applications. The purpose of this research was to present a new shaping retention method based on mathematical synthesis modeling for extrusion-based 3D-printing of ceramic pastes. Firstly, the steady-state equilibrium equation of the extrusion process was derived to provide clearer theoretical indications than purely experimental methods. Furthermore, a mathematical description framework was synthesized to better understand the extrusion-based 3D-printing of ceramic pastes from several realms: pastes rheology, extrudability, shape-holdability, and drying kinetics. Secondly, for eliminating shaping drawbacks (e.g., deformation and cracks) originating from non-digital control factors, we put forward a digital shape-retention technology inspired by the generalized drying kinetics of porous materials, which was different from existing retention solutions, e.g., freezing retention, thermally induced gelation, and using removable support structures. In addition, we developed an in situ hot air flow drying device easily attached to the nozzle of existing 3D printers. Confirmatory 3D-printing experiments of thin-walled cone-shape benchmark parts and the fire arrowhead-like object clearly demonstrated that the presented shape-retention method not only upgraded layer-by-layer forming capability but also enabled digital control of extrudate solidification. In addition, many more experimental results statistically showed that both fully solid parts and purely thin-wall parts had higher dimensional accuracy and better surface quality than the offline drying method. The 3D printed ceramic products with complex profiled surfaces conceivably demonstrated that our improved extrusion-based 3D-printing process of ceramic pastes has game-changing potentials beyond the traditional craftsmanship capacity.},

ABSTRACT = {Stringer-stiffened panels made of aluminium alloys are often used as structural elements in the aircraft industry. The load-carrying capacity of this type of structure cannot relieve the reduction in strength in the event of local buckling. In this paper, a method of fabrication of rib-stiffened panels made of EN AW-2024-T3 Alclad and EN AW-7075-T6 Alclad has been proposed using single point incremental forming. Panels made of sheets of different thickness and with different values of forming parameters were tested under the axial compression test. A digital image correlation (DIC)-based system was used to find the distribution of strain in the panels. The results of the axial compression tests revealed that the panels had two distinct buckling modes: (i) The panels buckled halfway up the panel height towards the rib, without any appreciable loss of rib stability, and (ii) the rib first lost stability at half its height with associated breakage, and then the panel was deflected in the opposite direction to the position of the rib. Different buckling modes can be associated with the character of transverse and longitudinal springback of panels resulting from local interaction of the rotating tool on the surface of the formed ribs.},

ABSTRACT = {The development of additive technology has made it possible to produce metamaterials with a regularly recurring structure, the properties of which can be controlled, predicted, and purposefully implemented into the core of components used in various industries. Therefore, knowing the properties and behavior of these structures is a very important aspect in their application in real practice from the aspects of safety and operational reliability. This article deals with the effect of cell size and volume ratio of a body-centered cubic (BCC) lattice structure made from Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) plastic on mechanical vibration damping and compression properties. The samples were produced in three sizes of a basic cell and three volume ratios by the fused deposition modeling (FDM) technique. Vibration damping properties of the tested 3D-printed ABS samples were investigated under harmonic excitation at three employed inertial masses. The metamaterial behavior and response under compressive loading were studied under a uniaxial full range (up to failure) quasi-static compression test. Based on the experimental data, a correlation between the investigated ABS samples’ stiffness evaluated through both compressive stress and mechanical vibration damping can be found.},

ABSTRACT = {Aluminum alloys are soft and have low melting temperatures; therefore, machining them often results in cut material fusing to the cutting tool due to heat and friction, and thus lowering the hole quality. A good practice is to use coated cutting tools to overcome such issues and maintain good hole quality. Therefore, the current study investigates the effect of cutting parameters (spindle speed and feed rate) and three types of cutting-tool coating (TiN/TiAlN, TiAlN, and TiN) on the surface finish, form, and dimensional tolerances of holes drilled in Al6061-T651 alloy. The study employed statistical design of experiments and ANOVA (analysis of variance) to evaluate the contribution of each of the input parameters on the measured hole-quality outputs (surface-roughness metrics Ra and Rz, hole size, circularity, perpendicularity, and cylindricity). The highest surface roughness occurred when using TiN-coated tools. All holes in this study were oversized regardless of the tool coating or cutting parameters used. TiN tools, which have a lower coating hardness, gave lower hole circularity at the entry and higher cylindricity, while TiN/TiAlN and TiAlN seemed to be more effective in reducing hole particularity when drilling at higher spindle speeds. Finally, optical microscopes revealed that a built-up edge and adhesions were most likely to form on TiN-coated tools due to TiN’s chemical affinity and low oxidation temperature compared to the TiN/TiAlN and TiAlN coatings.},

ABSTRACT = {The purpose of the following study was to compare the effect of the shape of a tool on the joint and to obtain the values of Friction Stir Welding (FSW) parameters that provide the best possible joint quality. The material used was an aluminium alloy, EN AW-3004 (AlMn1Mg1). To the authors’ best knowledge, no investigations of this alloy during FSW have been presented earlier. Five butt joints were made with a self-developed, cylindrical, and tapered threaded tool with a rotational speed of 475 rpm. In order to compare the welding parameters, two more joints with a rotational speed of 475 rpm and seven joints with a welding speed of 300 mm/min with the use of a cylindrical threaded pin were performed. This involved a visual inspection as well as a tensile strength test of the welded joints. It was observed that the value of the material outflow for the joints made with the cylindrical threaded pin was higher than it was for the joints made with the tapered threaded pin. However, welding defects in the form of voids appeared in the joints made with the tapered threaded tool. The use of the cylindrical tool resulted in higher values for about 37% of mechanical properties compared with the highest result for the tapered threaded joint. As far as the parameters were concerned, it was concluded that most of the specimens were properly joined for a rotational speed of 475 rpm. In the joints made with a welding speed of 300 mm/min, the material was not stirred properly. The best joint quality was given for a rotational speed of 475 rpm as well as a variety of welding speed values between 150 and 475 mm/min.},

ABSTRACT = {The thermal warpage problems in integrated circuit (IC) packaging exist in both flip-chip and two-and-a-half dimensional integrated circuits (2.5D IC) packages during manufacturing processes and thermal cycling service. This study proposes a simple and easy-to-use strain gauge measurement associated with a beam model theory to determine the thermally induced deformations and warpages of both packages. First, validation and limitations of the beam model theory are presented. Then, the thermally induced out-of-plane deformations for both packages are well described by the finite element method (FEM) simulation with a good consistency to full-field shadow moiré experimental results. The strain gauge measurements were implemented experimentally, and the thermal strain results were found to be well consistent with validated FEM ones. As a result, out-of-plane thermal deformations and warpages of the packages, calculated from the beam model theory with extracted curvature data from the strain gauge, were in reasonably good agreement with those from FEM analysis and shadow moiré measurements. Therefore, the strain gauge method of featuring point strain measurement combined with the beam model theory proved feasible in determining the thermal deformations and warpages of both IC packages.},

ABSTRACT = {The paper presents the results of testing the properties of HY 80 steel from the hull of a Kobben class 207 submarine after 60 years of operation in extreme sea conditions. Steels from the HY family in the post-war period were used to build American and German submarines. For the obtained fragment of steel from the hull of the Polish submarine ORP Jastrząb (ORP-Boat of the Republic of Poland), static tensile tests were performed on an MTS testing machine. Dynamic tensile tests were carried out on a rotary hammer for the strain rate in the range of 500~2000 s−1. Results: Based on the obtained results, the Johnson–Cook model and the failure parameters of HY 80 steel in terms of the finite element method (FEM) were developed. Conclusion: This model can be used to simulate fast-changing processes such as resistance of structures to collisions, shelling, and the impact of pressure waves caused by explosions in water and air related to submarines.},

ABSTRACT = {This study attempts to investigate the warpage behavior of a flip chip package-on-package (FCPoP) assembly during fabrication process. A process simulation framework that integrates thermal and mechanical finite element analysis (FEA), effective modeling and ANSYS element death-birth technique is introduced for effectively predicting the process-induced warpage. The mechanical FEA takes into account the viscoelastic behavior and cure shrinkage of the epoxy molding compound. In order to enhance the computational and modeling efficiency and retain the prediction accuracy at the same time, this study proposes a novel effective approach that combines the trace mapping method, rule of mixture and FEA to estimate the effective orthotropic elastic properties of the coreless substrate and core interposer. The study begins with experimental measurement of the temperature-dependent elastic and viscoelastic properties of the components in the assembly, followed by the prediction of the effective elastic properties of the orthotropic interposer and substrate. The predicted effective results are compared against the results of the ROM/analytical estimate and the FEA-based effective approach. Moreover, the warpages obtained from the proposed process simulation framework are validated by the in-line measurement data, and good agreement is presented. Finally, key factors that may influence process-induced warpage are examined via parametric analysis.},

ABSTRACT = {Hierarchical lattices are structures composed of self-similar or dissimilar architected metamaterials that span multiple length scales. Hierarchical lattices have superior and tunable properties when compared to conventional lattices, and thus, open the door for a wide range of material property manipulation and optimization. Using finite element analysis, we investigate the energy absorption capabilities of 3D hierarchical lattices for various unit cells under low strain rates and loads. In this study, we use fused deposition modeling (FDM) 3D printing to fabricate a dog bone specimen and extract the mechanical properties of thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) 85A with a hundred percent infill printed along the direction of tensile loading. With the numerical results, we observed that the energy absorption performance of the octet lattice can be enhanced four to five times by introducing a hierarchy in the structure. Conventional energy absorption structures such as foams and lattices have demonstrated their effectiveness and strengths; this research aims at expanding the design domain of energy absorption structures by exploiting 3D hierarchical lattices. The result of introducing a hierarchy to a lattice on the energy absorption performance is investigated by varying the hierarchical order from a first-order octet to a second-order octet. In addition, the effect of relative density on the energy absorption is isolated by creating a comparison between a first-order octet lattice with an equivalent relative density as a second-order octet lattice. The compression behaviors for the second order octet, dodecahedron, and truncated octahedron are studied. The effect of changing the cross-sectional geometry of the lattice members with respect to the energy absorption performance is investigated. Changing the orientation of the second-order cells from 0 to 45 degrees has a considerable impact on the force–displacement curve, providing a 20% increase in energy absorption for the second-order octet. Analytical solutions of the effective elasticity modulus for the first- and second-order octet lattices are compared to validate the simulations. The findings of this paper and the provided understanding will aid future works in lattice design optimization for energy absorption.},

ABSTRACT = {Nowadays, fused deposition modeling additive technology is becoming more and more popular in parts manufacturing due to its ability to reproduce complex geometries with many different thermoplastic materials, such as the TPU. On the other hand, objects obtained through this technology are mainly used for prototyping activities. For this reason, analyzing the functional behavior of FDM parts is still a topic of great interest. Many studies are conducted to broaden the spectrum of materials used to ensure an ever-increasing use of FDM in various production scenarios. In this study, the effects of several phenomena that influence the mechanical properties of printed lattice structures additively obtained by FDM are evaluated. Three different configurations of lattice structures with designs developed from unit cells were analyzed both experimentally and numerically. As the main result of the study, several parameters of the FDM process and their correlation were identified as possible detrimental factors of the mechanical properties by about 50% of the same parts used as isotropic cell solids. The best parameter configurations in terms of mechanical response were then highlighted by numerical analysis.},

ABSTRACT = {Hybrid aluminium metal matrix composites have the potential to replace single reinforced aluminium metal matrix composites due to improved properties. Moreover, tribological performance is critical for these composites, as they have extensive application areas, such as the automotive, aerospace, marine and defence industries. The present work aims to establish the tribological characteristics of Al7068/Si3N4/BN hybrid metal matrix composites prepared by stir casting route and studied using a pin-on-disc apparatus under dry sliding conditions. The hybrid composite samples were prepared at various weight percentages (0, 5, 10) of Si3N4 and BN particles. To investigate the tribological performance of the prepared composites, the wear experiments were conducted by varying the load (20, 40 and 60 N), sliding velocity (1.5, 2.5 and 3.5 m/s) and sliding distance (500, 1000 and 1500 m). Wear experimental runs were carried out based on the plan of experiments proposed by Taguchi. The minimum wear rate was found with the composite material reinforced with 10 wt. % of Si3N4 and 5 wt. % of BN. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was employed to analyse the effect of process parameters on wear rate and coefficient of friction (COF). The ANOVA test revealed that the weight fraction of Si3N4 has more of a contribution percentage (36.60%) on wear rate, and load has more of a contribution percentage (29.73%) on COF. The worn-out surface of the wear test specimens was studied using its corresponding SEM micrograph and correlated with the dry sliding wear experiment results.},

ABSTRACT = {This article deals with the dissimilar joining of two different grade Cr-Mo steel (2.25Cr-1Mo: P22 and modified 9Cr-1Mo: P91) for power plant application. The dissimilar butt-welded joint was produced for conventional V groove design by using the gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW) process with the application of an ERNiCrMo-3 Ni-based super alloy filler. A microstructure characterization was performed to measure the inhomogeneity in the microstructure and element diffusion across the interface in a welded joint. The experiments were also performed to evaluate the mechanical properties of the dissimilar welded joint in as-welded (AW) and post-weld heat treatment (PWHT) conditions. An acceptable level of the mechanical properties was obtained for the AW joint. After PWHT, a significant level of the element diffusion across the interface of the weld metal and P22 steel was observed, resulting in heterogeneity in microstructure near the interface, which was also supported by the hardness variation. Inhomogeneity in mechanical properties (impact strength and hardness) was measured across the weldments for the AW joint and was reduced after the PWHT. The tensile test results indicate an acceptable level of tensile properties for the welded joint in both AW and PWHT conditions and failure was noticed in the weak region of the P22 steel instead of the weld metal.},

ABSTRACT = {First-principles density functional theory (DFT) is employed to study the electronic structure of oxygen and gallium vacancies in monoclinic bulk β-Ga2O3 crystals. Hybrid exchange–correlation functional B3LYP within the density functional theory and supercell approach were successfully used to simulate isolated point defects in β-Ga2O3. Based on the results of our calculations, we predict that an oxygen vacancy in β-Ga2O3 is a deep donor defect which cannot be an effective source of electrons and, thus, is not responsible for n-type conductivity in β-Ga2O3. On the other hand, all types of charge states of gallium vacancies are sufficiently deep acceptors with transition levels more than 1.5 eV above the valence band of the crystal. Due to high formation energy of above 10 eV, they cannot be considered as a source of p-type conductivity in β-Ga2O3.},

ABSTRACT = {This study successfully established a strip warpage simulation model of the flip-chip process and investigated the effects of structural design and process (molding, post-mold curing, pretreatment, and ball mounting) on strip warpage. The errors between simulated and experimental values were found to be less than 8%. Taguchi analysis was employed to identify the key factors affecting strip warpage, which were discovered to be die thickness and substrate thickness, followed by mold compound thickness and molding temperature. Although a greater die thickness and mold compound thickness reduce the strip warpage, they also substantially increase the overall strip thickness. To overcome this problem, design criteria are proposed, with the neutral axis of the strip structure located on the bump. The results obtained using the criteria revealed that the strip warpage and overall strip thickness are effectively reduced. In summary, the proposed model can be used to evaluate the effect of structural design and process parameters on strip warpage and can provide strip design guidelines for reducing the amount of strip warpage and meeting the requirements for light, thin, and short chips on the production line. In addition, the proposed guidelines can accelerate the product development cycle and improve product quality with reduced development costs.},

ABSTRACT = {A neural network (NN)-based method is presented in this paper which allows the identification of parameters for material cards used in Finite Element simulations. Contrary to the conventionally used computationally intensive material parameter identification (MPI) by numerical optimization with internal or commercial software, a machine learning (ML)-based method is time saving when used repeatedly. Within this article, a self-developed ML-based Python framework is presented, which offers advantages, especially in the development of structural components in early development phases. In this procedure, different machine learning methods are used and adapted to the specific MPI problem considered herein. Using the developed NN-based and the common optimization-based method with LS-OPT, the material parameters of the LS-DYNA material card MAT_187_SAMP-1 and the failure model GISSMO were exemplarily calibrated for a virtually generated test dataset. Parameters for the description of elasticity, plasticity, tension–compression asymmetry, variable plastic Poisson’s ratio (VPPR), strain rate dependency and failure were taken into account. The focus of this paper is on performing a comparative study of the two different MPI methods with varying settings (algorithms, hyperparameters, etc.). Furthermore, the applicability of the NN-based procedure for the specific usage of both material cards was investigated. The studies reveal the general applicability for the calibration of a complex material card by the example of the used MAT_187_SAMP-1.},

ABSTRACT = {Federal rule changes governing natural gas pipelines have made non-destructive techniques, such as instrumented indentation testing (IIT), an attractive alternative to destructive tests for verifying properties of steel pipeline segments that lack traceable records. Ongoing work from Pacific Gas and Electric Company’s (PG&E) materials verification program indicates that IIT measurements may be enhanced by incorporating chemical composition data. This paper presents data from PG&E’s large-scale IIT program that demonstrates the predictive capabilities of IIT and chemical composition data, with particular emphasis given to differences between ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and yield strength (YS). For this study, over 80 segments of line pipe were evaluated through tensile testing, IIT, and compositional testing by optical emission spectroscopy (OES) and laboratory combustion. IIT measurements of UTS were, generally, in better agreement with destructive tensile data than YS and exhibited about half as much variability as YS measurements on the same sample. The root-mean squared error for IIT measurements of UTS and YS, respectively, were 27 MPa (3.9 ksi) and 43 MPa (6.2 ksi). Next, a machine learning model was trained to estimate YS and UTS by combining IIT with chemical composition data. The agreement between the model’s estimated UTS and tensile UTS values was only slightly better than the IIT-only measurements, with an RMSE of 21 MPa (3.1 ksi). However, the YS estimates showed much greater improvement with an improved RMSE of 27 MPa (3.9 ksi). The experimental, mechanical, and metallurgical factors that contributed to IIT’s ability to consistently determine destructive UTS, and the differences in its interaction with composition as compared to YS, are discussed herein.},

ABSTRACT = {Additive manufactured structures are replacing the corresponding ones realized with classical manufacturing technique. As for metallic structures, 3D printed components are generally subjected to dynamic loading conditions which can lead to fatigue failure. In this context, it is useful, and sometimes mandatory, to determine the fatigue life of such components through numerical simulation. The methods currently available in literature for the estimation of fatigue life were originally developed for metallic structures and, therefore, it is now necessary to verify their applicability also for components fabricated with different materials. To this end, in the current activity three of the most used spectral methods for the estimation of fatigue life were used to determine the fatigue life of a 3D printed Y-shaped specimen realized in polylactic acid subjected to random loads with the aim of determining their adaptability also for this kind of materials. To certify the accuracy of the numerical prediction, a set of experimental tests were conducted in order to obtain the real fatigue life of the component and to compare the experimental results with those numerically obtained. The obtained outcomes showed there is an excellent match between the numerical and the experimental data, thus certifying the possibility of using the investigated spectral methods to predict the fatigue life of additive manufactured components.},

ABSTRACT = {In this study, the ballistic impact behavior of auxetic sandwich composite human body armor was analyzed using finite element analysis. The auxetic core of the armor was composed of discrete re-entrant unit cells. The sandwich armor structure consisted of a front panel of aluminum alloy (Al 7075-T6), UHMWPE (sandwich core), and a back facet of silicon carbide (SiC) bonded together with epoxy resin. Numerical simulations were run on Explicit Dynamics/Autodyne 3-D code. Various projectile velocities with the same boundary conditions were used to predict the auxetic armor response. These results were compared with those of conventional monolithic body armor. The results showed improved indentation resistance with the auxetic armor. Deformation in auxetic armor was observed greater for each of the cases when compared to the monolithic armor, due to higher energy absorption. The elastic energy dissipation results in the lower indentation in an auxetic armor. The armor can be used safely up to 400 m/s; being used at higher velocities significantly reduced the threat level. Conversely, the conventional monolithic modal does not allow the projectile to pass through at a velocity below 300 m/s; however, the back face becomes severely damaged at 200 m/s. At a velocity of 400 m/s, the front facet of auxetic armor was destroyed; however, the back facet was completely safe, while the monolithic panel did not withstand this velocity and was completely damaged. The results are encouraging in terms of resistance offered by the newly adopted auxetic armor compared to conventional monolithic armor.},

ABSTRACT = {Designing corrugated board packaging is a real challenge, especially when the packaging material comes from multiple recycling. Recycling itself is a pro-ecological and absolutely necessary process, but the mechanical properties of materials that are processed many times deteriorate with the number of cycles. Manufacturers are trying to use unprecedented design methods to preserve the load-bearing capacity of packaging, even when the material itself is of deteriorating quality. An additional obstacle in the process of designing the structure of paper packaging is the progressive systematic reduction of the grammage (the so-called lightweight process) of corrugated cardboard. Therefore, this research presents a critical look at the process of optimal selection of corrugated cardboard for packaging structures, depending on the paper used. The study utilizes analytical, simplified formulas to estimate the strength of cardboard itself as well as the strength of packaging, which are then analyzed to determine their sensitivity to changes in cardboard components, such as the types of paper of individual layers. In the performed sensitivity analysis, numerical homogenization was used, and the influence of initial imperfections on the packaging mechanics was determined. The paper presents a simple algorithm for the optimal selection of the composition of corrugated cardboard depending on the material used and the geometry of the packaging, which allows for a more conscious production of corrugated cardboard from materials derived, e.g., from multiple recycling.},

ABSTRACT = {The demand for Liquefied natural gas (LNG) has rapidly increased over the past few years. This is because of increasingly stringent environmental regulations to curb harmful emissions from fossil fuels. LNG is one of the clean energy sources that has attracted a great deal of research. In the Republic of Korea, the use of LNG has been implemented in various sectors, including public transport buses, domestic applications, power generation, and in huge marine engines. Therefore, a proper, flexible, and safe transport system should be put in place to meet the high demand. In this work, finite element analysis (FEA) was performed on a domestically developed 40 ft ISO LNG tank using Ansys Mechanical software under low- and high-cycle conditions. The results showed that the fatigue damage factor for all the test cases was much lower than 1. The maximum principal stress generated in the 40 ft LNG ISO tank container did not exceed the yield strength of the calculated material (carbon steel). Maximum principal stress of 123.2 MPa and 107.61 MPa was obtained with low-cycle and high-cycle analysis, respectively, which is 50.28% less than the yield strength of carbon steel. The total number of cycles was greater than the total number of design cycles, and the 40 ft LNG ISO tank container was satisfied with a fatigue life of 20 years.},

ABSTRACT = {Welding defects are common during the production of large welded structures. However, few studies have explored methods of compensating for clear welding defects without resorting to re-welding. Here, an ultrasonic peening method to compensate for the deteriorated mechanical properties of overlap weld defects without repair welding was studied. We experimentally investigated changes in the mechanical properties of defective welds before and after ultrasonic peening. The weld specimen with an overlap defect contained a large cavity-type defect inside the weld bead, which significantly reduced the fatigue life. When the surface of the defective test piece was peened, the fatigue life of the weld plate was restored, resulting in an equivalent or higher number of cycles to failure, compared to a specimen with a normal weld. The recovery of mechanical properties was attributed to the effect of surface work hardening by ultrasonic peening and the change in stress distribution. Thus, ultrasonic peening could compensate for the deterioration of mechanical properties such as tensile strength, fatigue life, and elongation due to overlap defects, without resorting to repair welding.},

ABSTRACT = {Corrugated cardboard boxes are generally used in modern supply chains for the handling, storage, and distribution of numerous goods. These packages require suitable strength to maintain adequate protection within the package; however, the presence and configuration of any cutouts on the sidewalls significantly influence the packaging costs and secondary paperboard waste. This study aims to evaluate the performance of CCBs by considering the influence of different cutout configurations of sidewalls. The compression strength of various B-flute CCB dimensions (200 mm, 300 mm, 400 mm, 500 m, and 600 mm in length, with the same width and height of 300 mm), each for five cutout areas (0%, 4%, 16%, 36%, and 64%) were experimentally observed, and the results were compared with the McKee formula for estimation. The boxes with cutout areas of 0%, 4%, 16%, 36%, and 64% showed a linear decreasing tendency in compression force. A linear relationship was found between compression strength and an increase in cutout sizes. Packages with 0% and 4% cutouts did not show significant differences in compression strength (p < 0.05). Furthermore, this study shows a possible way to modify the McKee estimation for such boxes after obtaining empirical test data since the McKee formula works with a relatively high error rate on corrugated cardboard boxes with sidewall cutouts. Utilizing the numerical and experimental results, a favorable estimation map can be drawn up for packaging engineers to better manage material use and waste. The results of the study showed that the McKee formula does not appropriately estimate the box compression strength for various cutout sizes in itself.},

ABSTRACT = {Failure due to cracks is a major structural safety issue for engineering constructions. Human examination is the most common method for detecting crack failure, although it is subjective and time-consuming. Inspection of civil engineering structures must include crack detection and categorization as a key component of the process. Images can automatically be classified using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), a subtype of deep learning (DL). For image categorization, a variety of pre-trained CNN architectures are available. This study assesses seven pre-trained neural networks, including GoogLeNet, MobileNet-V2, Inception-V3, ResNet18, ResNet50, ResNet101, and ShuffleNet, for crack detection and categorization. Images are classified as diagonal crack (DC), horizontal crack (HC), uncracked (UC), and vertical crack (VC). Each architecture is trained with 32,000 images equally divided among each class. A total of 100 images from each category are used to test the trained models, and the results are compared. Inception-V3 outperforms all the other models with accuracies of 96%, 94%, 92%, and 96% for DC, HC, UC, and VC classifications, respectively. ResNet101 has the longest training time at 171 min, while ResNet18 has the lowest at 32 min. This research allows the best CNN architecture for automatic detection and orientation of cracks to be selected, based on the accuracy and time taken for the training of the model.},
