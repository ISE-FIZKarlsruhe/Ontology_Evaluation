ABSTRACT = {In this work, we assess the effects of sterilization in materials manufactured using additive manufacturing by employing a sterilization technique used in the food industry. To estimate the feasibility of the hydrostatic high-pressure (HHP) sterilization of biomedical devices, we have evaluated the mechanical properties of specimens produced by commercial 3D printers. Evaluations of the potential advantages and drawbacks of Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM), Digital Light Processing (DLP) technology, and Stereolithography (SLA) were considered for this study due to their widespread availability. Changes in mechanical properties due to the proposed sterilization technique were compared to values derived from the standardized autoclaving methodology. Enhancement of the mechanical properties of samples treated with Hydrostatic high-pressure processing enhanced mechanical properties, with a 30.30% increase in the tensile modulus and a 26.36% increase in the ultimate tensile strength. While traditional autoclaving was shown to systematically reduce the mechanical properties of the materials employed and damages and deformation on the surfaces were observed, HHP offered an alternative for sterilization without employing heat. These results suggest that while forgoing high-temperature for sanitization, HHP processing can be employed to take advantage of the flexibility of additive manufacturing technologies for manufacturing implants, instruments, and other devices.},

ABSTRACT = {Using carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) composites for enhancing the fatigue behavior of the steel structures will be an important application. As the most critical part, the fatigue behavior of the CFRP-to-steel bonded interface directly determines the strengthening effect of steel structures reinforced by CFRP. In this paper, a series of CFRP-to-steel double-shear specimens are performed in order to study the interfacial bond behavior between CFRP and steel under fatigue loading. Two parameters are considered: the upper bound value and the lower bound value of the fatigue loading. An analysis of test results indicates that the crack development rate increases with the increment of the stress ratio or stress level and the crack development process includes two phases: crack stable development phase and debonding failure phase. A calculation model is put forward to describe the relationship between the crack development rate and the stress level. Besides, it can be obtained from the test results that the fatigue lives of the specimens decrease with the increment of the stress level. The empirical formula of S-N curve based on the form of single logarithm formula is proposed and the fatigue limit under the experimental conditions in this paper is determined to be 0.343 by computational analysis.},

ABSTRACT = {Triple-layered composite plates are created by joining three composite layers using shear connectors. These layers, which are assumed to be always in contact and able to move relatively to each other during deformation, could be the same or different in geometric dimensions and material. They are applied in various engineering fields such as ship-building, aircraft wing manufacturing, etc. However, there are only a few publications regarding the calculation of this kind of plate. This paper proposes novel equations, which utilize Mindlin’s theory and finite element modelling to simulate the forced vibration of triple-layered composite plates with layers connected by shear connectors subjected to a moving load. Moreover, a Matlab computation program is introduced to verify the reliability of the proposed equations, as well as the influence of some parameters, such as boundary conditions, the rigidity of the shear connector, thickness-to-length ratio, and the moving load velocity on the dynamic response of the composite plate.},

ABSTRACT = {The shrinkage of reinforced polymer composites in injection molding varies, depending on the properties of the reinforcing agent. Therefore, the study of optimal reinforcement conditions, to minimize shrinkage when talc and glass fibers (GF) (which are commonly used as reinforcements) are incorporated into polypropylene (PP), is required. In this study, we investigated the effect of reinforcement factors, such as reinforcement type, reinforcement content, and reinforcement particle size, on the shrinkage, and optimized these factors to minimize the shrinkage of the PP composites. We measured the shrinkage of injection-molded samples, and, based on the measured values, the optimal conditions were obtained through analysis of variance (ANOVA), the Taguchi method, and regression analysis. It was found that reinforcement type had the largest influence on shrinkage among the three factors, followed by reinforcement content. In contrast, the reinforcement size was not significant, compared to the other two factors. If the reinforcement size was set as an uncontrollable factor, the optimum condition for minimizing directional shrinkage was the incorporation of 20 wt % GF and that for differential shrinkage was the incorporation of 20 wt % talc. In addition, a shrinkage prediction method was proposed, in which two reinforcing agents were incorporated into PP, for the optimization of various dependent variables. The results of this study are expected to provide answers about which reinforcement agent should be selected and incorporated to minimize the shrinkage of PP composites.},

ABSTRACT = {The performance characterization of the manufacturing processes for additive manufacturing (AM) systems is a significant task for their standardization and implementation in the industry. Also, there is a large diversity of materials used in different AM processes. In the present paper, a methodology is proposed to evaluate, in different directions, the performance of an AM process and material characterization in terms of surface quality. This methodology consists of eight steps, based on a new surface inspection artifact and basic artifact orientations. The proposed artifact with several design configurations fits different AM systems sizes and meets the needs of customers. The effects of main factors on the surface roughness of up-facing platens of the artifacts are investigated using the statistical design of experiments. The proposed methodology is validated by a case study focused on PolyJet material jetting technology. Samples are manufactured of photopolymer resins and post-processed. Three factors (i.e., artifact orientation, platen orientation, and finish type) are considered for the investigation. The case study results show that the platen orientation, finish type, and their interaction have a significant influence on the surface roughness (Ra). The best Ra roughness results were obtained for the glossy finish type in the range of 0.5–4 μm.},

ABSTRACT = {Smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) and the finite element method (FEM) are often combined with the scope to model the interaction between structures and the surrounding fluids (FSI). There is the case, for instance, of aircrafts crashing on water or speedboats slamming into waves. Due to the high computational complexity, the influence of air is often neglected, limiting the analysis to the interaction between structure and water. On the contrary, this work aims to specifically investigate the effect of air when merged inside the fluid–structure interaction (FSI) computational models. Measures from experiments were used as a basis to validate estimations comparing results from models that include or exclude the presence of air. Outcomes generally showed a great correlation between simulation and experiments, with marginal differences in terms of accelerations, especially during the first phase of impact and considering the presence of air in the model.},

ABSTRACT = {The effect of the Ni/Si mass ratio and combined thermomechanical treatment on the microstructure and properties of ternary Cu-Ni-Si alloys is discussed systematically. The Cu-Ni-Si alloy with a Ni/Si mass ratio of 4–5 showed good comprehensive properties. Precipitates with disc-like shapes were confirmed as the Ni2Si phase with orthorhombic structure through transmission electron microscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, and 3D atom probe characterization. After the appropriate thermomechanical treatment, the studied alloy with a Ni/Si mass ratio of 4.2 exhibited excellent mechanical properties: a hardness of 290 HV, tensile strength of 855 MPa, yield strength of 782 MPa, and elongation of 4.5%. Compared with other approaches, the thermomechanical treatment increased the hardness and strength without sacrificing electrical conductivity. Theoretical calculations indicated that the high strength was primarily attributed to the Orowan precipitation strengthening and secondarily ascribed to the work hardening, which were highly consistent with the experimental results. The appropriate Ni/Si mass ratio with a low content of Ni and Si atoms shows high strength and excellent electrical conductivity through combined thermomechanical treatment. This work provides a guideline for the design and preparation of multicomponent Cu-Ni-Si-X alloys with ultrahigh strength and excellent electrical conductivity.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, a 2-node beam element is developed based on Quasi-3D beam theory and mixed formulation for static bending of functionally graded (FG) beams. The transverse shear strains and stresses of the proposed beam element are parabolic distributions through the thickness of the beam and the transverse shear stresses on the top and bottom surfaces of the beam vanish. The proposed beam element is free of shear-looking without selective or reduced integration. The material properties of the functionally graded beam are assumed to vary according to the power-law index of the volume fraction of the constituents through the thickness of the beam. The numerical results of this study are compared with published results to illustrate the accuracy and convenience rate of the new beam element. The influence of some parametrics on the bending behavior of FGM beams is investigated.},

ABSTRACT = {The effectiveness of a model is the key factor of influencing the reliability-based design optimization (RBDO) of multi-failure turbine blades in the power system. A machine learning-based RBDO approach, called fuzzy multi-SVR learning method, was proposed by absorbing the strengths of fuzzy theory, support vector machine of regression (SVR), and multi-response surface method. The model of fuzzy multi-SVR learning method was established by adopting artificial bee colony algorithm to optimize the parameters of SVR models and considering the fuzziness of constraints based on fuzzy theory, in respect of the basic thought of multi-response surface method. The RBDO model and procedure with fuzzy multi-SVR learning method were then resolved and designed by multi-objective genetic algorithm. Lastly, the fuzzy RBDO of a turbine blade with multi-failure modes was performed regarding the design parameters of rotor speed, temperature, and aerodynamic pressure, and the design objectives of blade stress, strain, and deformation, and the fuzzy constraints of reliability degree and boundary conditions, as well. It is revealed (1) the stress and deformation of turbine blade are reduced by 92.38 MPa and 0.09838 mm, respectively. (2) The comprehensive reliability degree of the blade was improved by 3.45% from 95.4% to 98.85%. (3) It is verified that the fuzzy multi-SVR learning method is workable for the fuzzy RBDO of complex structures just like a multi-failure blade with high modeling precision, as well as high optimization, efficiency, and accuracy. The efforts of this study open a new research way, i.e., machine learning-based RBDO, for the RBDO of multi-failure structures, which expands the application of machine learning methods, and enriches the mechanical reliability design method and theory as well.},

ABSTRACT = {Coal contains a large number of fractures, whose characteristics are difficult to describe in detail, while their spatial distribution patterns may follow some macroscopic statistical laws. In this paper, several fracture geometric parameters (FGPs) were used to describe a fracture, and the coal seam was represented by a two-dimensional stochastic fracture network (SFN) which was generated and processed through a series of methods in MATLAB. Then, the processed SFN image was able to be imported into COMSOL Multiphysics and converted to a computational domain through the image function. In this way, the influences of different FGPs and their distribution patterns on the permeability of the coal seam were studied, and a finite element model to investigate gas flow properties in the coal seam was carried out. The results show that the permeability of the coal seam increased with the rising of fracture density, length, aperture, and with the decrease of the angle between the fracture orientation and the gas pressure gradient. It has also been found that large-sized fractures have a more significant contribution to coal reservoir permeability. Additionally, a numerical simulation of CBM extraction was carried out to show the potential of the proposed approach in the application of tackling practical engineering problems. According to the results, not only the connectivity of fractures but also variations of gas pressure and velocity can be displayed explicitly, which is consistent well with the actual situation.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, a research activity, focused on the investigation of new reinforcements able to improve the toughness of composite materials systems, is introduced. The overall aim is to delay the delamination propagation and, consequently, to increase the carrying load capability of composite structures by exploiting the fiber bridging effects. Indeed, the influence of fiber bridging related Mode I fracture toughness (GIc) values on the onset and propagation of delaminations in stiffened composite panels, under three-point bending loading conditions, have been experimentally and numerically studied. The investigated stiffened panels have been manufactured by using epoxy resin/carbon fibers material systems, characterized by different GIc values, which can be associated with the material fiber bridging sensitivity. Experimental data, in terms of load and delaminated area as a function of the out-of-plane displacements, have been obtained for each tested sample. Non-Destructive Inspection (NDI) has been performed to identify the debonding extension and position. To completely understand the evolution of the delamination and its dependence on the material characteristics, experiments have been numerically simulated using a newly developed robust numerical procedure for the delamination growth simulation, able to take into account the influence of the fracture toughness changes, associated with the materials’ fiber bridging sensitivity. The combined use of numerical results and experimental data has allowed introducing interesting considerations of the capability of the fiber bridging to substantially slow down the evolution of the debonding between skin and reinforcements in composite stiffened panels.},

ABSTRACT = {The paper aims to investigate the natural frequencies of sandwich plates by means of a Finite Element (FE) formulation based on the Reissner-Mindlin Zig-zag (RMZ) theory. The structures are made of a damaged isotropic soft-core and two external stiffer orthotropic face-sheets. These skins are strengthened at the nanoscale level by randomly oriented Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and are reinforced at the microscale stage by oriented straight fibers. These reinforcing phases are included in a polymer matrix and a three-phase approach based on the Eshelby-Mori-Tanaka scheme and on the Halpin-Tsai approach, which is developed to compute the overall mechanical properties of the composite material. A non-uniform distribution of the reinforcing fibers is assumed along the thickness of the skin and is modeled analytically by means of peculiar expressions given as a function of the thickness coordinate. Several parametric analyses are carried out to investigate the mechanical behavior of these multi-layered structures depending on the damage features, through-the-thickness distribution of the straight fibers, stacking sequence, and mass fraction of the constituents. Some final remarks are presented to provide useful observations and design criteria.},

ABSTRACT = {Metal additive manufacturing can produce geometrically complex parts with effective cost. The high thermal gradients due to the repeatedly rapid heat and solidification cause defects in the produced parts, such as cracks, porosity, undesired residual stress, and part distortion. Different techniques were employed for temperature investigation. Experimental measurement and finite element method-based numerical models are limited by the restricted accessibility and expensive computational cost, respectively. The available physics-based analytical model has promising short computational efficiency without resorting to finite element method or any iteration-based simulations. However, the heat transfer boundary condition cannot be considered without the involvement of finite element method or iteration-based simulations, which significantly reduces the computational efficiency, and thus the usefulness of the developed model. This work presents an explicit and closed-form solution, namely heat sink solution, to consider the heat transfer boundary condition. The heat sink solution was developed from the moving point heat source solution based on heat transfer of convection and radiation. The part boundary is mathematically discretized into many heats sinks due to the non-uniform temperature distribution, which causes non-uniform heat loss. The temperature profiles, thermal gradients, and temperature-affected material properties are calculated and presented. Good agreements were observed upon validation against experimental molten pool measurements.},

It has a working frequency band from 8.6 GHz to 22.5 GHz, with more than 9 dB RCS reduction. The monostatic RCS reduction has a wider bandwidth of coding diffusion metasurface as compared to the traditional chessboard metasurface. In addition, the bistatic performance of the designed metasurfaces is observed at 15.4 GHz, which shows obvious RCS reduction when compared to a metallic plate of the same size.

ABSTRACT = {The initial stability of a dental implant is known to be an indicator of osseointegration at immediate loading upon insertion. Implant designs have a fundamental role in the initial stability. Although new designs with advanced surface technology have been suggested for the initial stability of implant systems, verification is not simple because of various assessment factors. Our study focused on comparing the initial stability between two different implant systems via design aspects. A simulated model corresponding to the first molar derived from the mandibular bone was constructed. Biomechanical characteristics between the two models were compared by finite element analysis (FEA). Mechanical testing was also performed to derive the maximum loads for the two implant systems. CMI IS-III active (IS-III) had a more desirable stress distribution than CMI IS-II active (IS-II) in the surrounding bone region. Moreover, IS-III decreased the stress transfer to the nerve under the axial loading direction more than IS-II. Changes of implant design did not affect the maximum load. Our analyses suggest that the optimized design (IS-III), which has a bigger bone volume without loss of initial fixation, may minimize the bone damage during fixture insertion and we expect greater effectiveness in older patients.},

ABSTRACT = {The penetration enhancement behaviors of a reactive material double-layered liner (RM-DLL) shaped charge against thick steel targets are investigated. The RM-DLL comprises an inner copper liner, coupled with an outer PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene)/Al reactive material liner, fabricated via a cold pressing/sintering process. This RM-DLL shaped charge presents a novel defeat mechanism that incorporates the penetration capability of a precursor copper jet and the chemical energy release of a follow-thru reactive material penetrator. Experimental results showed that, compared with the single reactive liner shaped charge jet, a deeper penetration depth was produced by the reactive material-copper jet, whereas the penetration performance and reactive material mass entering the penetrated target strongly depended on the reactive liner thickness and standoff. To further illustrate the penetration enhancement mechanism, numerical simulations based on AUTODYN-2D code were conducted. Numerical results indicated that, with increasing reactive liner thickness, the initiation delay time of the reactive materials increased significantly, which caused the penetration depth and the follow-thru reactive material mass to increase for a given standoff. This new RM-DLL shaped charge configuration provides an extremely efficient method to enhance the penetration damage to various potential targets, such as armored fighting vehicles, naval vessels, and concrete targets.},

ABSTRACT = {Micromechanical fatigue lifetime predictions, in particular for the high cycle fatigue regime, require an appropriate modelling of mean stress effects in order to account for lifetime reducing positive mean stresses. Focus of this micromechanical study is the comparison of three selected fatigue indicator parameters (FIPs), with respect to their applicability to different total strain ratios. In this work, investigations are performed on the modelling and prediction of the fatigue crack initiation life of the martensitic high-strength steel SAE 4150 for two different total strain ratios. First, multiple martensitic statistical volume elements (SVEs) are generated by multiscale Voronoi tessellations. Micromechanical fatigue simulations are then performed on these SVEs by means of a crystal plasticity model to obtain microstructure dependent fatigue responses. In order to account for the material specific fatigue damage zone, a non-local homogenisation scheme for the FIPs is introduced for lath martensitic microstructures. The numerical results of the different non-local FIPs are compared with experimental fatigue crack initiation results for two different total strain ratios. It is concluded that the multiaxial fatigue criteria proposed by Fatemi-Socie is superior for predicting fatigue crack initiation life to the energy dissipation criteria and the accumulated plastic slip criteria for the investigated total strain ratios.},

ABSTRACT = {We have calculated that with the world population projected to increase from 7.5 billion in 2017 to 9.8 in 2050, the next generation (within 33 years) will produce 12,000–13,000 Mt of plastic, and that the yearly consumption will reach 37–40 kilos of plastic per person worldwide. One of the branches of the plastics industry is the production of plastics for agriculture e.g., seed trays and pots. In this paper, novel metakaolin-based geopolymer composites reinforced with cellulosic fibres are presented as an alternative to plastic pots. Materials can be dedicated to agricultural applications, provided they have neutral properties, however, geopolymer paste and its final products have high pH. Therefore, a two-step protocol of neutralisation of the geopolymer foam pots was optimised and implemented. The strength of the geopolymer samples was lower when foams were neutralised. The reinforcement of geopolymers with cellulose clearly prevented the reduction of mechanical properties after neutralisation, which was correlated with the lower volume of pores in the foam and with the cellulose chemical properties. Both, neutralisation and reinforcement with cellulose can also eliminate an efflorescence. Significantly increased plant growth was found in geopolymer pots in comparison to plastic pots. The cellulose in geopolymers resulted in better adsorption and slower desorption of minerals during fertilisation. This effect could also be associated with a lower number of large pores in the presence of cellulose fibres in pots, and thus more stable pore filling and better protection of internal surface interactions.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper investigates the progressive damage and failure behavior of unidirectional graphite fiber-reinforced aluminum composites (CF/Al composites) under transverse and longitudinal tensile loadings. Micromechanical finite element analyses are carried out using different assumptions regarding fiber, matrix alloy, and interface properties. The validity of these numerical analyses is examined by comparing the predicted stress-strain curves with the experimental data measured under transverse and longitudinal tensile loadings. Assuming a perfect interface, the transverse tensile strength is overestimated by more than 180% and the transverse fracture induced by fiber failure is unrealistic based on the experimental observations. In fact, the simulation and experiment results indicate that the interface debonding arising from the matrix alloy failure dominates the transverse fracture, and the influence of matrix alloy properties on the mechanical behavior is inconspicuous. In the case of longitudinal tensile testing, however, the characteristic of interface bonding has no significant effect on the macroscopic mechanical response due to the low in-situ strength of the fibers. It is demonstrated that ultimate longitudinal fracture is mainly controlled by fiber failure mechanisms, which is confirmed by the fracture morphology of the tensile samples.},

ABSTRACT = {The present study aimed to optimize the phase constituents and mechanical properties of the spark plasma sintered (SPS) Inconel 718 (IN718) alloy. A series of heat treatment routes were designed based on the phase relations in IN718 and performed for the optimization. The microstructure and phase compositions of the SPS IN718 alloys were examined by using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy disperse spectroscopy (EDS), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The mechanical properties of the samples were characterized at room temperature and at 650 °C. The results showed that large amounts of γ” (Ni3Nb) and γ’ (Ni3(Al, Ti)) strengthening phases precipitated in the IN718 alloy after direct aging (DA) of the as-fabricated sample. Moreover, the mechanical properties of the DA sample were comparable to that of the best one of the solution-treated and aged counterparts. The analysis showed that the rapid sintering and solid solution treatment of the IN718 alloy were achieved simultaneously by SPS. In the case of the SPS IN718 material, the direct aging regime had the same heat treatment effect as the conventional solid solution and aging treatment. This contributes toward improving the production efficiency and reduces manufacturing costs in the actual production process.},

ABSTRACT = {A microstructure finite element method combining the cohesive zone model (CZM) is used to simulate the mechanical behavior, deformation, and failure of polymer-bonded explosive (PBX) 9501 under quasi-static loading. PBX 9501 consists of Cyclotetramethylene tetranitramine (HMX) filler particles with a random distribution packaged in a polymeric binder. The particle is treated as elastic and the binder as viscoelastic. Cohesive elements with a bilinear softening law are inserted into the particle/binder interface, the HMX particle, and the binder to study the interface’s debonding and failure evolution. Macroscopic stress–strain curves homogenized across the microstructure under tension and compression with different strain rates are basically consistent with the experimental data. The interface debonding approximately vertical to the loading direction is the primary failure mechanism under tension, while shear failure along the interfaces and particle fracture plays a significant role under compression. The effects of interface strengths and strain rates on the performance of PBX 9501 are also evaluated. The tensile and compressive strengths are dependent on the interface strength and strain rate, but the failure paths are insensitive. This model is shown to accurately predict macroscopic responses and improve our understanding of the relationship between the mechanical behavior and microstructure of PBX 9501.},

ABSTRACT = {Weft-knitted fabrics offer an excellent formability into complex shapes for composite application. In biaxial weft-knitted fabric, additional yarns are inserted in the warp (wale-wise) and weft (course-wise) directions as a reinforcement. Due to these straight yarns, the mechanical properties of such fabrics are better than those of unreinforced weft-knitted fabrics. The forming process of flat fabrics into 3D preforms is challenging and requires numerical simulation. In this paper, the mechanical behavior of biaxial weft-knitted fabrics is simulated by means of macro- and meso-scale finite element method (FEM) models. The macro-scale modelling approach is based on a shell element formulation and offers reasonable computational costs but has some limitations by the description of fabric mechanical characteristics and forming behavior. The meso-scale modelling approach based on beam elements can describe the fabric’s mechanical and forming characteristics better at a higher computational cost. The FEM models were validated by comparing the results of various simulations with the equivalent experiments. With the help of the parametric models, the forming of biaxial weft-knitted fabrics into complex shapes can be simulated. These models help to predict material and process parameters for optimized forming conditions without the necessity of costly experimental trials.},

While using the collected 269 data from previous experimental studies, artificial neural network (ANN) models with three different learning algorithms namely back-propagation (BP), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and new hybrid PSO-BP algorithms, were constructed and the performance of the models was evaluated with regard to the prediction accuracy, efficiency, and stability through a threefold procedure. It was found that the PSO-BP neural network model was superior to the simple ANNs that were trained by a single algorithm and it is suitable for predicting the CS of GGBFS concrete.},

ABSTRACT = {Skid resistance is an important surface characteristic that influences roadway safety. Various studies have been performed to understand the interaction between pavement and tires through numerical simulation for skid resistance prediction. However, the friction parameters required for simulation inputs are generally determined by objective assumptions. This paper develops a finite element method (FEM)-based skid resistance simulation framework using in-situ 3D pavement surface texture and skid resistance data. A 3D areal pavement model is reconstructed from high resolution asphalt pavement surface texture data. The exponential decay friction model is implemented in the simulation and the interface friction parameters required for the simulation are determined using the binary search back-calculation approach based on a trial process with the desired level of differences between simulated and observed skid numbers. To understand the influence of texture characteristics on interface friction parameters, the high-resolution 3D texture data is separated into macro- and micro-scales through Butterworth filtering and various areal texture indicators are calculated at both levels. Principal component analysis (PCA) regression analysis is conducted to quantify the relationship between various texture characteristics and the interface friction parameters. The results from this study can be used to better prepare the inputs of friction parameters for FEM simulation.},

ABSTRACT = {This investigation presents the results of research on low cycle fatigue properties of Sc-modified AA2519-T62 extrusion. The basic mechanical properties of the investigated alloy have been established in the tensile test. The low cycle fatigue testing has been performed on five different levels of total strain amplitude: 0.4%; 0.5%; 0.6%; 0.7% and 0.8% with cycle asymmetry coefficient R = 0.1. For each level of total strain amplitude, the graphs of variations in stress amplitude and plastic strain amplitude in the number of cycles have been presented. The obtained results allowed to establish Ramberg-Osgood and Manson-Coffin-Basquin relationships. The established values of the cyclic strength coefficient and cyclic strain hardening exponent equal to k’ = 1518.1 MPa and n’ = 0.1702. Based on the Manscon-Coffin-Basquin equation, the values of the following parameters have been established: the fatigue strength coefficient σ’f = 1489.8 MPa, the fatigue strength exponent b = −0.157, the fatigue ductility coefficient ε’f = 0.4931 and the fatigue ductility exponent c = −1.01. The fatigue surfaces of samples tested on 0.4%, 0.6% and 0.8% of total strain amplitude have been subjected to scanning electron microscopy observations. The scanning electron microscopy observations of the fatigue surfaces revealed the presence of cracks in striations in the surrounding area with a high concentration of precipitates. It has been observed that larger Al2Cu precipitates exhibit a higher tendency to fracture than smaller precipitates having a higher concentration of scandium and zirconium.},

ABSTRACT = {Fused filament fabrication (FFF) is one of the most popular additive manufacturing (AM) techniques used to fabricate polymeric structures. However, these polymeric structures suffer from an inherent deficiency of weak inter-laminar tensile strength. Because of this weak inter-laminar strength, these parts fail prematurely and exhibit only a fraction of the mechanical properties of those fabricated using conventional means. In this paper, we study the effect of thermal annealing in the presence of an initially applied static uniaxial load on the ultimate tensile strength of parts fabricated using FFF. Tensile specimens or dogbones were fabricated from an acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) filament with a glass transition temperature (Tg) of 105 °C; these specimens were then isothermally annealed, post manufacture, in a fixture across a given range of temperatures and static loads. Tensile testing was then performed on these specimens to gauge the effect of the thermal annealing and static loading on inter-laminar tensile strength by measuring the ultimate tensile strength of the specimens. A design of experiments (DOE) approach was followed to calculate the main and interaction effects of the two factors (temperature and static loading) on the ultimate tensile strength, and an analysis of variance was conducted. Cross-sectional images of the specimens were studied to observe the changes in the mesostructure of the specimens that led to the increase in inter-laminar strength of the parts. The results show that temperature plays a dominant role in increasing the ultimate tensile strength and an 89% increase in the average ultimate tensile strength was seen corresponding to an annealing temperature of 160 °C. A change in the mesostructure of the parts is seen, which is characterized by an increase in bond length and void coalescence. These results can be helpful in studying the structural strength of 3D printed parts, and thus could eventually guide the fabrication of components with strength comparable to those of conventional manufacturing techniques.},

ABSTRACT = {Cellulose nanofiber (CNF) exhibits excellent mechanical properties, which has been extensively proven through experimental techniques. However, understanding the mechanisms and the inherent structural behavior of cellulose is important in its vastly growing research areas of applications. This study focuses on taking a look into what happens to the atomic molecular interactions of CNF, mainly hydrogen bond, in the presence of external force. This paper investigates the hydrogen bond disparity within CNF structure. To achieve this, molecular dynamics simulations of cellulose I β nanofibers are carried out in equilibrated conditions in water using GROMACS software in conjunction with OPLS-AA force field. It is noted that the hydrogen bonds within the CNF are disrupted when a pulling force is applied. The simulated Young’s modulus of CNF is found to be 161 GPa. A simulated shear within the cellulose chains presents a trend with more hydrogen bond disruptions at higher forces.},

ABSTRACT = {To manufacture custom medical parts or scaffolds with reduced defects and high mechanical characteristics, new research on optimizing the selective laser melting (SLM) parameters are needed. In this work, a biocompatible powder, 316L stainless steel, is characterized to understand the particle size, distribution, shape and flowability. Examination revealed that the 316L particles are smooth, nearly spherical, their mean diameter is 39.09 μm and just 10% of them hold a diameter less than 21.18 μm. SLM parameters under consideration include laser power up to 200 W, 250–1500 mm/s scanning speed, 80 μm hatch spacing, 35 μm layer thickness and a preheated platform. The effect of these on processability is evaluated. More than 100 samples are SLM-manufactured with different process parameters. The tensile results show that is possible to raise the ultimate tensile strength up to 840 MPa, adapting the SLM parameters for a stable processability, avoiding the technological defects caused by residual stress. Correlating with other recent studies on SLM technology, the tensile strength is 20% improved. To validate the SLM parameters and conditions established, complex bioengineering applications such as dental bridges and macro-porous grafts are SLM-processed, demonstrating the potential to manufacture medical products with increased mechanical resistance made of 316L.},

ABSTRACT = {Additive manufacturing (AM) is today in the main focus—and not only in commercial production. Products with complex geometry can be built using various AM techniques, which include laser sintering of metal powder. Although the technique has been known for a quite long time, the impact of the morphology of individual powder particles on the process has not yet been adequately documented. This article presents a detailed microscopic analysis of virgin and reused powder particles of MS1 maraging steel. The metallographic observation was performed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The particle size of the individual powder particles was measured in the SEM and the particle surface morphology and its change in the reused powder were observed. Individual particles were analyzed in detail using an SEM with a focused ion beam (FIB) milling capability. The powder particles were gradually cut off in thin layers so that their internal structure, chemical element distribution, possible internal defects, and shape could be monitored. Elemental distribution and phase distribution were analyzed using EDS and EBSD, respectively. Our findings lead to a better understanding and prediction of defects in additive-manufactured products. This could be helpful not just in the AM field, but in any metal powder-based processes, such as metal injection molding, powder metallurgy, spray deposition processes, and others.},

ABSTRACT = {Compressive strength is considered as one of the most important parameters in concrete design. Time and cost can be reduced if the compressive strength of concrete is accurately estimated. In this paper, a new prediction model for compressive strength of high-performance concrete (HPC) was developed using a non-tuned machine learning technique, namely, a regularized extreme learning machine (RELM). The RELM prediction model was developed using a comprehensive dataset obtained from previously published studies. The input variables of the model include cement, blast furnace slag, fly ash, water, superplasticizer, coarse aggregate, fine aggregate, and age of specimens. k-fold cross-validation was used to assess the prediction reliability of the developed RELM model. The prediction results of the RELM model were evaluated using various error measures and compared with that of the standard extreme learning machine (ELM) and other methods presented in the literature. The findings of this research indicate that the compressive strength of HPC can be accurately estimated using the proposed RELM model.},

ABSTRACT = {Concrete filled steel tubes (CFSTs) show advantageous applications in the field of construction, especially for a high axial load capacity. The challenge in using such structure lies in the selection of many parameters constituting CFST, which necessitates defining complex relationships between the components and the corresponding properties. The axial capacity (Pu) of CFST is among the most important mechanical properties. In this study, the possibility of using a feedforward neural network (FNN) to predict Pu was investigated. Furthermore, an evolutionary optimization algorithm, namely invasive weed optimization (IWO), was used for tuning and optimizing the FNN weights and biases to construct a hybrid FNN–IWO model and improve its prediction performance. The results showed that the FNN–IWO algorithm is an excellent predictor of Pu, with a value of R2 of up to 0.979. The advantage of FNN–IWO was also pointed out with the gains in accuracy of 47.9%, 49.2%, and 6.5% for root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and R2, respectively, compared with simulation using the single FNN. Finally, the performance in predicting the Pu in the function of structural parameters such as depth/width ratio, thickness of steel tube, yield stress of steel, concrete compressive strength, and slenderness ratio was investigated and discussed.},

ABSTRACT = {Constitutive models for plastic deformation of metals are typically based on flow rules determining the transition from elastic to plastic response of a material as function of the applied mechanical load. These flow rules are commonly formulated as a yield function, based on the equivalent stress and the yield strength of the material, and its derivatives. In this work, a novel mathematical formulation is developed that allows the efficient use of machine learning algorithms describing the elastic-plastic deformation of a solid under arbitrary mechanical loads and that can replace the standard yield functions with more flexible algorithms. By exploiting basic physical principles of elastic-plastic deformation, the dimensionality of the problem is reduced without loss of generality. The data-oriented approach inherently offers a great flexibility to handle different kinds of material anisotropy without the need for explicitly calculating a large number of model parameters. The applicability of this formulation in finite element analysis is demonstrated, and the results are compared to formulations based on Hill-like anisotropic plasticity as reference model. In future applications, the machine learning algorithm can be trained by hybrid experimental and numerical data, as for example obtained from fundamental micromechanical simulations based on crystal plasticity models. In this way, data-oriented constitutive modeling will also provide a new way to homogenize numerical results in a scale-bridging approach.},

Three models of beams differing in cross-sectional dimensions showed high agreement with experimental data: relative error in the case of natural frequencies did not exceed 5% (2.2% on average), the models were characterized by the full agreement of mode shapes and high agreement of frequency response functions with the results of experimental tests. Additionally, the developed beam models supported the reliable description of complex structures, as demonstrated on a spatial frame, obtaining a relative error for natural frequencies of less than 3% (on average 1.7%). Full agreement with the mode shapes and high agreement with the frequency response functions were achieved in the analyzed frequency range.},

ABSTRACT = {Blast resistant gates/doors are essential for sensitive infrastructure, such as embassies, ministries, or parliaments. Lightweight gates equipped with ‘energy absorbing systems’ have better operational performance than the traditional costly and bulky design. Graded auxetic structures have not yet been used as potential passive damping systems in the supporting frame of blast resistant gates. Consequently, this study tries to test if a uniaxial graded auxetic damper (UGAD) proposed by the authors in a recent article, namely the development of a new shock absorbing UGAD, could maintain a 3000 mm × 4500 mm steel gate operable after high blast peak reflected overpressure of 6.6 MPa, from 100 kg TNT at 5 m stand-off distance. The blast-induced response of the gate was assessed, with and without the proposed UGAD, using Abaqus/Explicit solver. Results showed that the attachment of the proposed UGAD to the gate led to a dramatic decrease in permanent deformations (a critical factor for gate operability after a blast event). Hence, a lighter, more economical gate (with 50% reduction in mass) was required to satisfy the operability condition. In addition, 49% of peak reaction forces were diminished, that have a direct impact on the supporting frame. Moreover, the results revealed that, in the numerical model, 56% of the achieved plastic dissipation energy was from the UGADs, and 44% from the gate. The outcomes of this research may have a positive impact on other sectors beyond academia, such as industry, economy, and public safety.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, the main objectives are to investigate and select the most suitable parameters used in particle swarm optimization (PSO), namely the number of rules (nrule), population size (npop), initial weight (wini), personal learning coefficient (c1), global learning coefficient (c2), and velocity limits (fv), in order to improve the performance of the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system in determining the buckling capacity of circular opening steel beams. This is an important mechanical property in terms of the safety of structures under subjected loads. An available database of 3645 data samples was used for generation of training (70%) and testing (30%) datasets. Monte Carlo simulations, which are natural variability generators, were used in the training phase of the algorithm. Various statistical measurements, such as root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), Willmott’s index of agreement (IA), and Pearson’s coefficient of correlation (R), were used to evaluate the performance of the models. The results of the study show that the performance of ANFIS optimized by PSO (ANFIS-PSO) is suitable for determining the buckling capacity of circular opening steel beams, but is very sensitive under different PSO investigation and selection parameters. The findings of this study show that nrule = 10, npop = 50, wini = 0.1 to 0.4, c1 = [1, 1.4], c2 = [1.8, 2], fv = 0.1, which are the most suitable selection values to ensure the best performance for ANFIS-PSO. In short, this study might help in selection of suitable PSO parameters for optimization of the ANFIS model.},

ABSTRACT = {In this work, a Preisach-recurrent neural network model is proposed to predict the dynamic hysteresis in ARMCO pure iron, an important soft magnetic material in particle accelerator magnets. A recurrent neural network coupled with Preisach play operators is proposed, along with a novel validation method for the identification of the model’s parameters. The proposed model is found to predict the magnetic flux density of ARMCO pure iron with a Normalised Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE) better than 0.7%, when trained with just six different hysteresis loops. The model is evaluated using ramp-rates not used in the training procedure, which shows the ability of the model to predict data which has not been measured. The results demonstrate that the Preisach model based on a recurrent neural network can accurately describe ferromagnetic dynamic hysteresis when trained with a limited amount of data, showing the model’s potential in the field of materials science.},

ABSTRACT = {The welding of cemented carbide to tool steel is a challenging task, of scientific and industrial relevance, as it combines the high level of hardness of cemented carbide with the high level of fracture toughness of steel, while reducing the shaping cost and extending the application versatility, as its tribological, toughness, thermal and chemical properties can be optimally harmonised. The already existing joining technologies often impart either insufficient toughness or poor high-temperature strength to a joint to withstand the ever-increasing severe service condition demands. In this paper, a novel capacitor discharge welding (CDW) process is investigated for the case of a butt-joint between a tungsten carbide-cobalt (WC-Co) composite rod and an AISI M35 high-speed steel (HSS) rod. The latter was shaped with a conical-ended projection to promote a high current concentration and heat at the welding zone. CDW functions by combining a direct current (DC) electric current pulse and external uniaxial pressure after a preloading step, in which only uniaxial pressure is applied. The relatively high heating and cooling rates promote a thin layer of a characteristic ultrafine microstructure that combines high strength and toughness. Morphological analysis showed that the CDW process: (a) forms a sound and net shaped joint, (b) preserves the sub-micrometric grain structure of the original WC-Co composite base materials, via a transitional layer, (c) refines the microstructure of the original martensite of the HSS base material, and (d) results in an improved corrosion resistance across a 1-mm thick layer near the weld interface on the steel side. A nano-indentation test survey determined: (e) no hardness deterioration on the HSS side of the weld zone, although (f) a slight decrease in hardness was observed across the transitional layer on the composite side. Furthermore, (g) an indication of toughness of the joint was perceived as the size of the crack induced by processing the residual stress after sample preparation was unaltered.},

ABSTRACT = {The rapid growth of Additive Manufacturing (AM) in the past decade has demonstrated a significant potential in cost-effective production with a superior quality product. A numerical simulation is a steep way to learn and improve the product quality, life cycle, and production cost. To cope with the growing AM field, researchers are exploring different techniques, methods, models to simulate the AM process efficiently. The goal is to develop a thermo-mechanical weld model for the Directed Energy Deposition (DED) process for 316L stainless steel at an efficient computational cost targeting to model large AM parts in residual stress calculation. To adapt the weld model to the DED simulation, single and multi-track thermal simulations were carried out. Numerical results were validated by the DED experiment. A good agreement was found between predicted temperature trends for numerical simulation and experimental results. A large number of weld tracks in the 3D solid AM parts make the finite element process simulation challenging in terms of computational time and large amounts of data management. The method of activating elements layer by layer and introducing heat in a cyclic manner called a thermal cycle heat input was applied. Thermal cycle heat input reduces the computational time considerably. The numerical results were compared to the experimental data for thermal and residual stress analyses. A lumping of layers strategy was implemented to reduce further computational time. The different number of lumping layers was analyzed to define the limit of lumping to retain accuracy in the residual stress calculation. The lumped layers residual stress calculation was validated by the contour cut method in the deposited sample. Thermal behavior and residual stress prediction for the different numbers of a lumped layer were examined and reported computational time reduction.},

ABSTRACT = {Despite their great potential for energy-saving applications, it is still challenging to design passive radiative cooling (RC) materials with simultaneous high performance and simple structures based on traditional design philosophy. To solve the contradiction between optimization speed and corresponding performance, we present a flexible hybrid optimization strategy based on a genetic algorithm (GA) in conjunction with the transfer matrix method and introducing the calculation of radiative cooling power density in the evaluation function of the GA. As a demonstration, an optimized coating with 1.5-μm-overlapping MgF2 and Si3N4 layers on top of a silver film was numerically designed. Based on a detailed analysis of the material’s electromagnetic properties and cooling performance, this coating achieved a radiative cooling power density of 62 W/m2 and a temperature reduction of 6.8 °C at an ambient temperature of 300 K. Our optimization strategy may have special significance in the design of high-performance RC materials or other multi-spectral engineering materials with simple structures.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, the effects of different hydrophobic coatings on the surface of covered electrodes on the quality of wet welded carbon steel joints were discussed. Commonly available hydrophobic substances used in industrial applications were selected for the research. The aim of using waterproof coatings was to check the possibility to decreasing the susceptibility of high-strength low-alloy S460N steel to cold cracking. During experiments diffusible hydrogen content in deposited metal determination by mercury method, metallographic macro- and microscopic testing and hardness measurements were performed. Investigations showed that waterproof coatings laid on covered electrodes can improve the quality of wet welded joints, by decreasing the Vickers HV10 hardness in heat-affected zone and decreasing the diffusible hydrogen content in deposited metal, which minimalize possibility of cold cracking.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper presents research on the impact of fly ash addition on selected physical and mechanical parameters of concrete made with slag cement. Experimental tests were carried out to measure the migration of chloride ions in concrete, the tightness of concrete exposed to water under pressure, and the compressive strength and tensile strength of concrete during splitting. Six series of concrete mixes made with CEM IIIA 42.5 and 32.5 cement were tested. The base concrete mix was modified by adding fly ash as a partial cement substitute in the amounts of 25% and 33%. A comparative analysis of the obtained results indicates a significant improvement in tightness, especially in concrete based on CEM IIIA 32.5 cement and resistance to chloride ion penetration for the concretes containing fly ash additive. In the concretes containing fly ash additive, a slower rate of initial strength increase and high strength over a long period of maturation are shown. In accordance with the presented research results, it is suggested that changes to the European standardization system be considered, to allow the use of fly ash additive in concrete made with CEM IIIA 42.5 or 32.5 cement classes. Such a solution is not currently acceptable in standards in some European Countries.},

ABSTRACT = {The contour scan strategies in laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) of Ti-6Al-4V were studied at the coupon level. These scan strategies determined the surface qualities and subsurface residual stresses. The correlations to these properties were identified for an optimization of the LPBF processing. The surface roughness and the residual stresses in build direction were linked: combining high laser power and high scan velocities with at least two contour lines substantially reduced the surface roughness, expressed by the arithmetic mean height, from values as high as 30 µm to 13 µm, while the residual stresses rose from ~340 to about 800 MPa. At this stress level, manufactured rocket fuel injector components evidenced macroscopic cracking. A scan strategy completing the contour region at 100 W and 1050 mm/s is recommended as a compromise between residual stresses (625 MPa) and surface quality (14.2 µm). The LPBF builds were monitored with an in-line twin-photodiode-based melt pool monitoring (MPM) system, which revealed a correlation between the intensity quotient I2/I1, the surface roughness, and the residual stresses. Thus, this MPM system can provide a predictive estimate of the surface quality of the samples and resulting residual stresses in the material generated during LPBF.},

ABSTRACT = {Three-dimensional (3D) printing continuous carbon fiber-reinforced polylactic acid (PLA) composites offer excellent tensile mechanical properties. The present study aimed to research the effect of process parameters on the tensile mechanical properties of 3D printing composite specimens through a series of mechanical experiments. The main printing parameters, including layer height, extrusion width, printing temperature, and printing speed are changed to manufacture specimens based on the modified fused filament fabrication 3D printer, and the tensile mechanical properties of 3D printing continuous carbon fiber-reinforced PLA composites are presented. By comparing the outcomes of experiments, the results show that relative fiber content has a significant impact on mechanical properties and the ratio of carbon fibers in composites is influenced by layer height and extrusion width. The tensile mechanical properties of continuous carbon fiber-reinforced composites gradually decrease with an increase of layer height and extrusion width. In addition, printing temperature and speed also affect the fiber matrix interface, i.e., tensile mechanical properties increase as the printing temperature rises, while the tensile mechanical properties decrease when the printing speed increases. Furthermore, the strengthening mechanism on the tensile mechanical properties is that external loads subjected to the components can be transferred to the carbon fibers through the fiber-matrix interface. Additionally, SEM images suggest that the main weakness of continuous carbon fiber-reinforced 3D printing composites exists in the fiber-matrix interface, and the main failure is the pull-out of the fiber caused by the interface destruction.},

ABSTRACT = {Extreme atmospheric conditions in the marine and offshore industry are harmful to engineering materials, especially to welded joints, and may cause degradation of their properties. This article presents the results of research on the plasticity of bead-on-plate welds made using two types of seamless, copper plated flux-cored wires. Before welding, spools with wire were stored for 1 month in two distinct locations with different geographical and industrial conditions in Poland, and then subjected to visual examination. Bead-on-plate welds were subjected to a static tensile test and on this basis plasticity indexes showing the effect of storage on plasticity were determined. The fractures after tensile tests and the surfaces of the wires were examined on an electron scanning microscope. Additionally, diffusible hydrogen content in deposited metal measurements for each condition were carried out. The highest degradation level was found for wire stored in an agricultural building in north-eastern Poland—there was an almost fourfold decrease in the plasticity index value and the highest diffusible hydrogen content. For the same wire and the same location, the largest difference was also observed in fracture morphology after the tensile test—ductile fracture was obtained for wire at delivery condition while an almost full cleavage fracture was found after relatively short (1 month) storage of wire.},

ABSTRACT = {The design of advanced alloys specifically tailored to additive manufacturing processes is a research field that is attracting ever-increasing attention. Laser powder-bed fusion (LPBF) commonly uses pre-alloyed, fine powders (diameter usually 15–45 µm) to produce fully dense metallic parts. The availability of such fine, pre-alloyed powders reduces the iteration speed of alloy development for LPBF and renders it quite costly. Here, we overcome these drawbacks by performing in-situ alloying in LPBF starting with pure elemental powder mixtures avoiding the use of costly pre-alloyed powders. Pure iron, chromium, and nickel powder mixtures were used to perform in-situ alloying to manufacture 304 L stainless steel cube-shaped samples. Process parameters including scanning speed, laser power, beam diameter, and layer thickness were varied aiming at obtaining a chemically homogeneous alloy. The scientific questions focused on in this work are: which process parameters are required for producing such samples (in part already known in the state of the art), and why are these parameters conducive to homogeneity? Analytical modelling of the melt pool geometry and temperature field suggests that the residence time in the liquid state is the most important parameter controlling the chemical homogeneity of the parts. Results show that in-situ alloying can be successfully employed to enable faster and cost-efficient rapid alloy development.},

ABSTRACT = {In this study, a computational procedure for the investigation of the vibration behavior of laminated composite structures, including graphene inclusions in the matrix, is developed. Concerning the size-dependent behavior of graphene, its mechanical properties are derived using nanoscopic empiric equations. Using the appropriate Halpin-Tsai models, the equivalent elastic constants of the graphene reinforced matrix are obtained. Then, the orthotropic mechanical properties of a composite lamina of carbon fibers and hybrid matrix can be evaluated. Considering a specific stacking sequence and various geometric configurations, carbon fiber-graphene-reinforced hybrid composite plates are modeled using conventional finite element techniques. Applying simply support or clamped boundary conditions, the vibrational behavior of the composite structures are finally extracted. Specifically, the modes of vibration for every configuration are derived, as well as the effect of graphene inclusions in the natural frequencies, is calculated. The higher the volume fraction of graphene in the matrix, the higher the natural frequency for every mode. Comparisons with other methods, where it is possible, are performed for the validation of the proposed method.},

ABSTRACT = {Studies on the application of auxetic metamaterials and structures in furniture joints are very limited. However, they have huge potential for use in ready-to-assemble furniture. This study aimed to design and produce different types of auxetic dowels in 3D printing technology, and experimentally and numerically analyze the withdrawal strength of these dowels. In the scope of the study, 24 auxetic dowels with different types and size of inclusions, different diameter of holes, and a non-auxetic reference dowel were designed and produced with appropriate muffs. Dowels were 3D printed from polyamide (PA12). Poisson’s ratios, withdrawal strength, contact pressures, and friction coefficients of dowels were determined theoretically by means of numerical analyses and real static compression tests. After the pre-production of dowels, the dowels with triangular inclusions have not been found to have sufficient strength and stiffness. Withdrawal strength of dowels decreased as the size of inclusions is decreased, or dowel hole diameter is increased. Furthermore, contact pressures and stresses in auxetic dowels were considerably lower than non-auxetic dowels under the withdrawal force.},

ABSTRACT = {While repair is mainly used to restore the original part geometry and properties, hybrid manufacturing aims to exploit the benefits of each respective manufacturing process regarding either processing itself or resulting part characteristics. Especially with the current implementation of additive manufacturing in the production of TiAl, turbine blades for both hybrid manufacturing and repair new opportunities are enabled. One main issue is the compatibility of the two or more material types involved, which either differ regarding composition or microstructure or both. In this study, a TNMTM-alloy (Ti-Nb-Mo) was manufactured by different processes (casting, forging, laser additive manufacturing) and identically heat-treated at 1290 °C. Chemical compositions, especially aluminum and oxygen contents, were measured, and the resulting microstructures were analyzed with Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and High-energy X-ray diffraction (HEXRD). The properties were determined by hardness measurements and high-temperature compression tests. The comparison led to an overall assessment of the theoretical compatibility. Experiments to combine several processes were performed to evaluate the practical feasibility. Despite obvious differences in the final phase distribution caused by deviations in the chemical composition, the measured properties of the samples did not differ significantly. The feasibility of combining direct energy deposition (DED) with either casting or laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) was demonstrated by the successful build of the dense, crack-free hybrid material.},

ABSTRACT = {It is widely known that the printing quality of fused filament fabrication (FFF) is heavily affected by environmental temperature and humidity, taking the form of warping and porosity. However, there is little understanding about the quantitative relations between environmental conditions, geometry, and the mechanical properties of printed parts. In this study, we systematically investigated those relations using bisphenol A polycarbonate as a model material system. For the environmental temperature, an in-situ infrared imaging analysis revealed the presence of an up to 5.4 °C/mm thermal gradient when printing using an open-chamber printer and a heated build plate. For the environmental humidity, an analysis of X-ray micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) scans showed an up to 11.7% porosity that was brought by polymer water content absorbed from environmental moisture. Meanwhile, tensile tests showed a mechanical performance loss associated with those defects, but, surprisingly, the transverse direction ductility had the potential to increase at a higher porosity. Furthermore, the experimental results were combined with analytical and parametrical studies to elucidate quantitative relations between environmental conditions and printing quality. Based on the results, quantitative guidelines for the estimation of printing quality based on environmental conditions are provided that would also help users to obtain desired printing results with a better understanding of the effects of environmental conditions.},

ABSTRACT = {The powder bed fusion (PBF) process is a type of Additive Manufacturing (AM) technique which enables fabrication of highly complex geometries with unprecedented design freedom. However, PBF still suffers from manufacturing constraints which, if overlooked, can cause various types of defects in the final part. One such constraint is the local accumulation of heat which leads to surface defects such as melt ball and dross formation. Moreover, slow cooling rates due to local heat accumulation can adversely affect resulting microstructures. In this paper, first a layer-by-layer PBF thermal process model, well established in the literature, is used to predict zones of local heat accumulation in a given part geometry. However, due to the transient nature of the analysis and the continuously growing domain size, the associated computational cost is high which prohibits part-scale applications. Therefore, to reduce the overall computational burden, various simplifications and their associated effects on the accuracy of detecting overheating are analyzed. In this context, three novel physics-based simplifications are introduced motivated by the analytical solution of the one-dimensional heat equation. It is shown that these novel simplifications provide unprecedented computational benefits while still allowing correct prediction of the zones of heat accumulation. The most far-reaching simplification uses the steady-state thermal response of the part for predicting its heat accumulation behavior with a speedup of 600 times as compared to a conventional analysis. The proposed simplified thermal models are capable of fast detection of problematic part features. This allows for quick design evaluations and opens up the possibility of integrating simplified models with design optimization algorithms.},

ABSTRACT = {The effect of halide composition on the structural, electronic, and optical properties of CsPb(Br1−xClx)3 perovskite was investigated in this study. When the chloride (Cl) content of x was increased, the unit cell volume decreased with a linear function. Theoretical X-ray diffraction analyses showed that the peak (at 2θ = 30.4°) shifts to a larger angle (at 2θ = 31.9°) when the average fraction of the incorporated Cl increased. The energy bandgap (Eg) was observed to increase with the increase in Cl concentration. For x = 0.00, 0.25, 0.33, 0.50, 0.66, 0.75, and 1.00, the Eg values calculated using the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof potential were between 1.53 and 1.93 eV, while those calculated using the modified Becke−Johnson generalized gradient approximation (mBJ–GGA) potential were between 2.23 and 2.90 eV. The Eg calculated using the mBJ–GGA method best matched the experimental values reported. The effective masses decreased with a concentration increase of Cl to 0.33 and then increased with a further increase in the concentration of Cl. Calculated photoabsorption coefficients show a blue shift of absorption at higher Cl content. The calculations indicate that CsPb(Br1−xClx)3 perovskite could be used in optical and optoelectronic devices by partly replacing bromide with chloride.},

ABSTRACT = {The material properties of thermoplastic polymer parts manufactured by the extrusion-based additive manufacturing process are highly dependent on the thermal history. Different numerical models have been proposed to simulate the thermal history of a 3D-printed part. However, they are limited due to limited geometric applicability; low accuracy; or high computational demand. Can the time–temperature history of a 3D-printed part be simulated by a computationally less demanding, fast numerical model without losing accuracy? This paper describes the numerical implementation of a simplified discrete-event simulation model that offers accuracy comparable to a finite element model but is faster by two orders of magnitude. Two polymer systems with distinct thermal properties were selected to highlight differences in the simulation of the orthotropic response and the temperature-dependent material properties. The time–temperature histories from the numerical model were compared to the time–temperature histories from a conventional finite element model and were found to match closely. The proposed highly parallel numerical model was approximately 300–500 times faster in simulating thermal history compared to the conventional finite element model. The model would enable designers to compare the effects of several printing parameters for specific 3D-printed parts and select the most suitable parameters for the part.},

ABSTRACT = {In order to provide a better understanding of the phenomena that define the weld bead penetration and melting rate of consumables in underwater welding, welds were developed with a rutile electrode in air welding conditions and at the simulated depths of 5 and 10 m with the use of a hyperbaric chamber and a gravity feeding system. In this way, voltage and current signals were acquired. Data processing involved the welding voltage, determination of the sum of the anodic and cathodic drops, calculation of the short-circuit factor, and determination of the melting rate. Cross-sectional samples were also taken from the weld bead to assess bead geometry. As a result, the collected data show that the generation of energy in the arc–electrode connection in direct polarity (direct current electrode negative-DCEN) is affected by the hydrostatic pressure, causing a loss of fusion efficiency, a drop of operating voltage, decreased arc length, and increased number of short-circuit events. The combination of these characteristics kept the weld bead geometry unchanged, compared to dry weld conditions. With the positive electrode (direct current electrode positive-DCEP), radial losses were derived from greater arc lengths resulting from increasing hydrostatic pressure, which led to a decrease in weld penetration.},

ABSTRACT = {The novel ternary carbides and nitrides, known as MAX phase materials with remarkable combined metallic and ceramic properties, offer various engineering and technological applications. Using ab initio calculations based on generalized gradient approximation (GGA), local density approximation (LDA), and the quasiharmonic Debye model; the electronic, structural, elastic, mechanical, and thermodynamic properties of the M2GaC (M = Zr, Hf) MAX phase were investigated. The optimized lattice parameters give the first reference to the upcoming theocratical and experimental studies, while the calculated elastic constants are in excellent agreement with the available data. Moreover, obtained elastic constants revealed that both the Zr2GaC and Hf2GaC MAX phases are brittle. The band structure and density of states analysis showed that these MAX phases are electrical conductors, having strong directional bonding between M-C (M = Zr, Hf) atoms due to M-d and C-p hybridization. Formation and cohesive energies, and phonon calculations showed that Zr2GaC and Hf2GaC MAX phases’ compounds are thermodynamically and dynamically stable and can be synthesized experimentally. Finally, the effect of temperature and pressure on volume, heat capacity, Debye temperature, Grüneisen parameter, and thermal expansion coefficient of M2GaC (M = Zr, Hf) are evaluated using the quasiharmonic Debye model from the nonequilibrium Gibbs function in the temperature and pressure range 0–1600 K and 0–50 GPa respectively.},

ABSTRACT = {This study investigated the influence of the curing time on the fracture toughness of concrete produced with different content of low calcium fly ash (LCFA). During the study, the amounts of 20% and 30% of pozzolanic additive were used. In order to observe the effect of the applied pozzolanic additive on the analyzed concrete properties, the obtained results were compared with the values obtained for the reference concrete. Compressive strength—fcm and fracture toughness, by using mode II loading—KIIc (shearing), were determined between the 3rd and 365th days of curing. In the course of experiments, changes in the development of cracks in individual series of concrete were also analyzed. In addition, the microstructures of all composites and the nature of macroscopic crack propagation in mature concretes were assessed. It was observed that the greatest increase in fracture toughness at shear was in the case of reference concrete during the first 28 days, whereas, in the case of concretes containing LCFA, in the period of time above 4 weeks. Furthermore, concrete without the LCFA additives were characterized by a brittle fracture. In contrast to it, concretes with LCFA additives are mainly characterized by a quasi-plastic process of failure. Moreover, most of the samples showed a typical pattern of the destruction that occurs as a result of shearing. The presented test results may be helpful in selecting the composition of concrete mixtures containing LCFA to be used in concrete and reinforced concrete structures subjected to shear loads.},

ABSTRACT = {The purpose of the study was to test the usefulness of deep learning artificial neural networks and statistical modeling in predicting the strength of bone cements with defects. The defects are related to the introduction of admixtures, such as blood or saline, as contaminants into the cement at the preparation stage. Due to the wide range of applications of deep learning, among others in speech recognition, bioinformation processing, and medication design, the extent was checked to which it is possible to obtain information related to the prediction of the compressive strength of bone cements. Development and improvement of deep learning network (DLN) algorithms and statistical modeling in the analysis of changes in the mechanical parameters of the tested materials will enable determining an acceptable margin of error during surgery or cement preparation in relation to the expected strength of the material used to fill bone cavities. The use of the abovementioned computer methods may, therefore, play a significant role in the initial qualitative assessment of the effects of procedures and, thus, mitigation of errors resulting in failure to maintain the required mechanical parameters and patient dissatisfaction.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, a comparison of the mechanical properties of high-strength low-alloy S460N steel welded joints is presented. The welded joints were made by the gas metal arc welding (GMAW) process in the air environment and water, by the local cavity welding method. Welded joints were tested following the EN ISO 15614-1:2017 standard. After welding, the non-destructive—visual, penetrant, radiographic, and ultrasonic (phased array) tests were performed. In the next step, the destructive tests, as static tensile-, bending-, impact- metallographic (macroscopic and microscopic) tests, and Vickers HV10 measurements were made. The influence of weld porosity on the mechanical properties of the tested joints was also assessed. The performed tests showed that the tensile strength of the joints manufactured in water (567 MPa) could be similar to the air welded joint (570 MPa). The standard deviations from the measurements were—47 MPa in water and 33 MPa in the air. However, it was also stated that in the case of a complex state of stress, for example, bending, torsional and tensile stresses, the welding imperfections (e.g., pores) significantly decrease the properties of the welded joint. In areas characterized by porosity the tensile strength decreased to 503 MPa. Significant differences were observed for bending tests. During the bending of the underwater welded joint, a smaller bending angle broke the specimen than was the case during the air welded joint bending. Also, the toughness and hardness of joints obtained in both environments were different. The minimum toughness for specimens welded in water was 49 J (in the area characterized by high porosity) and in the air it was 125 J (with a standard deviation of 23 J). The hardness in the heat-affected zone (HAZ) for the underwater joint in the non-tempered area was above 400 HV10 (with a standard deviation of 37 HV10) and for the air joint below 300 HV10 (with a standard deviation of 17 HV10). The performed investigations showed the behavior of S460N steel, which is characterized by a high value of carbon equivalent (CeIIW) 0.464%, during local cavity welding.},

ABSTRACT = {The article presents a comparative analysis of the impact of the addition of steel and polypropylene fibers on the properties of the concrete mixes and hardened concrete used in the concrete floor industry. The behavior of concrete intended for floors is different from conventional structural concrete because it is formed horizontally; until now, the effect of steel and polypropylene fibers on the properties of concrete formed horizontally has not yet been fully understood. Therefore, the aim of this article is to examine this issue and compare the behavior of concrete modified with steel and polypropylene fibers in concrete that is formed horizontally. The following properties of fresh concrete mixes were analyzed: consistency, the content of air-voids, and bulk density. Consequently, the following properties of hardened concrete were analyzed: compressive strength, bending tensile strength, and brittleness. It was confirmed that steel and polypropylene fibers have a different type of effect on the properties of fresh concrete mixes and hardened concrete. Finally, a combined economic and mechanical analysis was performed.},

ABSTRACT = {The necessity to progress towards sustainability has inspired modern researchers to examine the lubrication and cooling effects of vegetable oils on conventional metal cutting operations. Consequently, as an eco-friendly vegetable product, castor oil can be the right choice as Minimum quantity lubrication (MQL) base fluid. Nonetheless, the high viscosity of castor oil limits its flowability and restricts its industrial application. Conversely, palm oil possesses superior lubricity, as well as flowability characteristics. Hence, an attempt has been made to improve the lubrication behavior of castor oil. Here, six castor-palm mixtures (varying from 1:0.5–1:3) were utilized as MQL-fluid, and the values of machining responses viz. average surface roughness, specific cutting energy, and tool wear were evaluated. Furthermore, an integrated Shannon’s Entropy-based Technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) framework was employed for selecting the most suitable volume ratio of castor-palm oil mixture. The rank provided by the TOPSIS method confirmed that 1:2 was the best volume ratio for castor-palm oil mixture. Afterward, a comparative analysis demonstrated that the best castor-palm volume fraction resulted in 8.262 and 16.146% lowering of surface roughness, 5.459 and 7.971% decrement of specific cutting energy, 2.445 and 3.155% drop in tool wear compared to that of castor and palm oil medium, respectively.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper presents the results of the fracture toughness of concretes containing two mineral additives. During the tests, the method of loading the specimens according to Mode I fracture was used. The research included an evaluation of mechanical parameters of concrete containing noncondensed silica fume (SF) in an amount of 10% and siliceous fly ash (FA) in the following amounts: 0%, 10% and 20%. The experiments were carried out on mature specimens, i.e., after 28 days of curing and specimens at an early age, i.e., after 3 and 7 days of curing. In the course of experiments, the effect of adding SF to the value of the critical stress intensity factor—KIcS in FA concretes in different periods of curing were evaluated. In addition, the basic strength parameters of concrete composites, i.e., compressive strength—fcm and splitting tensile strength—fctm, were measured. A novelty in the presented research is the evaluation of the fracture toughness of concretes with two mineral additives, assessed at an early age. During the tests, the structures of all composites and the nature of macroscopic crack propagation were also assessed. A modern and useful digital image correlation (DIC) technique was used to assess macroscopic cracks. Based on the conducted research, it was found the application of SF to FA concretes contributes to a significant increase in the fracture toughness of these materials at an early age. Moreover, on the basis of the obtained test results, it was found that the values of the critical stress intensity factor of analyzed concretes were convergent qualitatively with their strength parameters. It also has been demonstrated that in the first 28 days of concrete curing, the preferred solution is to replace cement with SF in the amount of 10% or to use a cement binder substitution with a combination of additives in proportions 10% SF + 10% FA. On the other hand, the composition of mineral additives in proportions 10% SF + 20% FA has a negative effect on the fracture mechanics parameters of concretes at an early age. Based on the analysis of the results of microstructural tests and the evaluation of the propagation of macroscopic cracks, it was established that along with the substitution of the cement binder with the combination of mineral additives, the composition of the cement matrix in these composites changes, which implies a different, i.e., quasi-plastic, behavior in the process of damage and destruction of the material.},

ABSTRACT = {This research aims to examine the fracture toughness of hybrid fibrous geopolymer composites under mode II. For this purpose, eight geopolymer mixtures were cast and tested to evaluate the influence of steel and synthetic fiber hybridization on mode II fracture response. The first mixture was plain and was kept as a reference, while steel, polypropylene and glass fibers were used in the rest seven mixtures. The first three of which were mono-reinforced with one of the three fibers, while the rest of the four were hybrids reinforced with combinations of steel and synthetic fibers. The Brazilian center notched disc and the double notched cube test configurations were used to evaluate the mode II fracture toughness of the eight mixtures. The results of the tests showed that steel fibers played the vital role in enhancing the fracture toughness, where the mixtures S1.6 and S1.3G0.3 showed the best performance. The results also showed that increasing the notch depth decreased the fracture toughness with an approximate linear decrement fashion. It was found that the use of double-notched cubes resulted in much higher fracture toughness than the Brazilian notched discs, where the ratio of normalized fracture toughness of the disc specimens to cube specimens was approximately 0.37 to 0.47. This is attributed to the concentration of stresses along one defined path in the disc specimens compared to the multi-path stresses in the cube specimens. In addition, the accompanied tensile stresses in the disc specimens may lead to a mode I fracture before the designed mode II fracture.},

ABSTRACT = {In the present work, for the first time, free vibration response of angle ply laminates with uncertainties is attempted using Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline (MARS), Artificial Neural Network-Particle Swarm Optimization (ANN-PSO), Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), and Adaptive Network Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS). The present approach employed 2D C0 stochastic finite element (FE) model based on the Third Order Shear Deformation Theory (TSDT) in conjunction with MARS, ANN-PSO, GPR, and ANFIS. The TSDT model used eliminates the requirement of shear correction factor owing to the consideration of the actual parabolic distribution of transverse shear stress. Zero transverse shear stress at the top and bottom of the plate is enforced to compute higher-order unknowns. C0 FE model makes it commercially viable. Stochastic FE analysis done with Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) FORTRAN inhouse code, selection of design points using a random variable framework, and soft computing with MARS, ANN-PSO, GPR, and ANFIS is implemented using MATLAB in-house code. Following the random variable frame, design points were selected from the input data generated through Monte Carlo Simulation. A total of four-mode shapes are analyzed in the present study. The comparison study was done to compare present work with results in the literature and they were found in good agreement. The stochastic parameters are Young’s elastic modulus, shear modulus, and the Poisson ratio. Lognormal distribution of properties is assumed in the present work. The current soft computation models shrink the number of trials and were found computationally efficient as the MCS-based FE modelling. The paper presents a comparison of MARS, ANN-PSO, GPR, and ANFIS algorithm performance with the stochastic FE model based on TSDT.},

ABSTRACT = {Nonlinear finite element (FE) analysis of reinforced concrete (RC) structures is characterized by numerous modeling options and input parameters. To accurately model the nonlinear RC behavior involving concrete cracking in tension and crushing in compression, practitioners make different choices regarding the critical modeling issues, e.g., defining the concrete constitutive relations, assigning the bond between the concrete and the steel reinforcement, and solving problems related to convergence difficulties and mesh sensitivities. Thus, it is imperative to review the common modeling choices critically and develop a robust modeling strategy with consistency, reliability, and comparability. This paper proposes a modeling strategy and practical recommendations for the nonlinear FE analysis of RC structures based on parametric studies of critical modeling choices. The proposed modeling strategy aims at providing reliable predictions of flexural responses of RC members with a focus on concrete cracking behavior and crushing failure, which serve as the foundation for more complex modeling cases, e.g., RC beams bonded with fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) laminates. Additionally, herein, the implementation procedure for the proposed modeling strategy is comprehensively described with a focus on the critical modeling issues for RC structures. The proposed strategy is demonstrated through FE analyses of RC beams tested in four-point bending—one RC beam as reference and one beam externally bonded with a carbon-FRP (CFRP) laminate in its soffit. The simulated results agree well with experimental measurements regarding load-deformation relationship, cracking, flexural failure due to concrete crushing, and CFRP debonding initiated by intermediate cracks. The modeling strategy and recommendations presented herein are applicable to the nonlinear FE analysis of RC structures in general.},

ABSTRACT = {Lightweight materials are finding plentiful applications in various engineering sectors due to their high strength-to-weight ratios. Hole-making is an inevitable requirement for their structural applications, which is often marred by thermal damages of the drill causing unacceptable shortening of tool life. Efficient cooling of the tool is a prime requirement for enhancing the process viability. The current work presents a novel technique of cooling only the twist drill between drilling of holes with no effect of the applied cryogenic coolant transferred to the work material. The technique is applied in the drilling of two commonly used high-strength lightweight materials: carbon fibers reinforced polymer (CFRP) and an alloy of titanium (Ti-6Al-4V). The efficacy of the cooling approach is compared with those of conventionally applied continuous cryogenic cooling and no-cooling. The effectiveness is quantified in terms of tool wear, thrust force, hole quality, specific cutting energy, productivity, and consumption of the cryogenic fluid. The experimental work leads to a finding that between-the-holes cryogenic cooling possesses a rich potential in curbing tool wear, reducing thrust force and specific energy consumption, and improving hole quality in drilling of CFRP. Regarding the titanium alloy, it yields a much better surface finish and lesser consumption of specific cutting energy.},

ABSTRACT = {In this study, dissimilar sheets including AA3003 aluminum and A441 AISI steel were welded via cooling-assisted friction stir welding (FSW). Three different cooling mediums including forced CO2, forced water, and forced air were employed, and a non-cooled sample was processed to compare the cooling-assisted condition with the traditional FSW condition. The highest cooling rate belongs to CO2 and the lowest cooling rate belongs to the non-cooled sample as FSW. The best macrograph without any segregation at interface belongs to the water-cooled sample and the poorest joint with notable segregation belongs to the CO2 cooling FSW sample. The CO2 cooling FSW sample exhibits the smallest grain size due to the suppression of grain growth during dynamic recrystallization (DRX). The intermetallic compound (IMC) thickening was suppressed by a higher cooling rate in CO2 cooling sample and just Al-rich phase was formed in this joint. The lowest cooling rate in the FSW sample exhibits formation of the Fe rich phase. The IMC layers were thicker at the top of the weld due to closeness with the heat generation source. The water cooling sample exhibits the highest tensile strength due to proper mechanical bonding simultaneously with optimum IMC thickness to provide appropriate metallurgical bonding. Fractography observation indicates that there is a semi-ductile fracture in the water cooling sample and CO2 cooling sample exhibits more brittle fracture. Hardness evaluation reveals that the higher the cooling rate formed, the higher the hardness in stir zone, and hardness changes in the aluminum side were higher than the steel side.},

ABSTRACT = {Extrusion-based three-dimensional (3D) printing methods are preferred and emerging approaches for freely digital fabrication of ceramics due to ease of use, low investment, high utilization of materials, and good adaptability to multi-materials. However, systematic knowledge still lacks an explanation for what is their 3D printability. Moreover, some uncontrollable factors including extrudate shape retention and nonuniform drying inevitably limit their industrial applications. The purpose of this research was to present a new shaping retention method based on mathematical synthesis modeling for extrusion-based 3D-printing of ceramic pastes. Firstly, the steady-state equilibrium equation of the extrusion process was derived to provide clearer theoretical indications than purely experimental methods. Furthermore, a mathematical description framework was synthesized to better understand the extrusion-based 3D-printing of ceramic pastes from several realms: pastes rheology, extrudability, shape-holdability, and drying kinetics. Secondly, for eliminating shaping drawbacks (e.g., deformation and cracks) originating from non-digital control factors, we put forward a digital shape-retention technology inspired by the generalized drying kinetics of porous materials, which was different from existing retention solutions, e.g., freezing retention, thermally induced gelation, and using removable support structures. In addition, we developed an in situ hot air flow drying device easily attached to the nozzle of existing 3D printers. Confirmatory 3D-printing experiments of thin-walled cone-shape benchmark parts and the fire arrowhead-like object clearly demonstrated that the presented shape-retention method not only upgraded layer-by-layer forming capability but also enabled digital control of extrudate solidification. In addition, many more experimental results statistically showed that both fully solid parts and purely thin-wall parts had higher dimensional accuracy and better surface quality than the offline drying method. The 3D printed ceramic products with complex profiled surfaces conceivably demonstrated that our improved extrusion-based 3D-printing process of ceramic pastes has game-changing potentials beyond the traditional craftsmanship capacity.},

ABSTRACT = {The paper presents the effects of waterproof coatings use to cover electrodes on the weldability of high-strength, low-alloy (HSLA) steel in water. With the aim of improving the weldability of S460N HSLA steel in water, modifications of welding filler material were chosen. The surfaces of electrodes were covered by different hydrophobic substances. The aim of the controlled thermal severity (CTS) test was to check the influence of these substances on the HSLA steel weldability in the wet welding conditions. The visual test, metallographic tests, and hardness Vickers HV10 measurements were performed during investigations. The results proved that hydrophobic coatings can reduce the hardness of welded joints in the heat-affected zone by 40–50 HV10. Additionally, the number of cold cracks can be significantly reduced by application of waterproof coatings on the filler material. The obtained results showed that electrode hydrophobic coatings can be used to improve the weldability of HSLA steel in underwater conditions.},

ABSTRACT = {Fused deposition modeling represents a flexible and relatively inexpensive alternative for the production of custom-made polymer lattices. However, its limited accuracy and resolution lead to geometric irregularities and poor mechanical properties when compared with the digital design. Although the link between geometric features and mechanical properties of lattices has been studied extensively, the role of manufacturing parameters has received little attention. Additionally, as the size of cells/struts nears the accuracy limit of the manufacturing process, the interaction between geometry and manufacturing parameters could be decisive. Hence, the influence of three geometric and two manufacturing parameters on the mechanical behavior was evaluated using a fractional factorial design of experiments. The compressive behavior of two miniature lattice structures, the truncated octahedron and cubic diamond, was evaluated, and multilinear regression models for the elastic modulus and plateau stress were developed. Cell size, unit cell type, and strut diameter had the largest impact on the mechanical properties, while the influence of feedstock material and layer thickness was very limited. Models based on factorial design, although limited in scope, could be an effective tool for the design of customized lattice structures.},

ABSTRACT = {The development of additive technology has made it possible to produce metamaterials with a regularly recurring structure, the properties of which can be controlled, predicted, and purposefully implemented into the core of components used in various industries. Therefore, knowing the properties and behavior of these structures is a very important aspect in their application in real practice from the aspects of safety and operational reliability. This article deals with the effect of cell size and volume ratio of a body-centered cubic (BCC) lattice structure made from Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) plastic on mechanical vibration damping and compression properties. The samples were produced in three sizes of a basic cell and three volume ratios by the fused deposition modeling (FDM) technique. Vibration damping properties of the tested 3D-printed ABS samples were investigated under harmonic excitation at three employed inertial masses. The metamaterial behavior and response under compressive loading were studied under a uniaxial full range (up to failure) quasi-static compression test. Based on the experimental data, a correlation between the investigated ABS samples’ stiffness evaluated through both compressive stress and mechanical vibration damping can be found.},

ABSTRACT = {Aluminum alloys are soft and have low melting temperatures; therefore, machining them often results in cut material fusing to the cutting tool due to heat and friction, and thus lowering the hole quality. A good practice is to use coated cutting tools to overcome such issues and maintain good hole quality. Therefore, the current study investigates the effect of cutting parameters (spindle speed and feed rate) and three types of cutting-tool coating (TiN/TiAlN, TiAlN, and TiN) on the surface finish, form, and dimensional tolerances of holes drilled in Al6061-T651 alloy. The study employed statistical design of experiments and ANOVA (analysis of variance) to evaluate the contribution of each of the input parameters on the measured hole-quality outputs (surface-roughness metrics Ra and Rz, hole size, circularity, perpendicularity, and cylindricity). The highest surface roughness occurred when using TiN-coated tools. All holes in this study were oversized regardless of the tool coating or cutting parameters used. TiN tools, which have a lower coating hardness, gave lower hole circularity at the entry and higher cylindricity, while TiN/TiAlN and TiAlN seemed to be more effective in reducing hole particularity when drilling at higher spindle speeds. Finally, optical microscopes revealed that a built-up edge and adhesions were most likely to form on TiN-coated tools due to TiN’s chemical affinity and low oxidation temperature compared to the TiN/TiAlN and TiAlN coatings.},

ABSTRACT = {An algorithm to determine the maximum temperature of brake systems during repetitive short-term (RST) braking mode has been proposed. For this purpose, the intermittent mode of braking was given in the form of a few cyclic stages consisting of subsequent braking and acceleration processes. Based on the Chichinadze’s hypothesis of temperature summation, the evolutions of the maximum temperature during each cycle were calculated as the sum of the mean temperature on the nominal contact surface of the friction pair elements and temperature attained on the real contact areas (flash temperature). In order to find the first component, the analytical solution to the one-dimensional thermal problem of friction for two semi-spaces taking into account frictional heat generation was adapted. To find the flash temperature, the solution to the problem for the semi-infinite rod sliding with variable velocity against a smooth surface was used. In both solutions, the temperature-dependent coefficient of friction and thermal sensitivity of materials were taken into account. Numerical calculations were carried out for disc and drum brake systems. The obtained temporal variations of sliding velocity, friction power and temperature were investigated on each stage of braking. It was found that the obtained results agree well with the corresponding data established by finite element and finite-difference methods.},

ABSTRACT = {The features of composite materials such as production flexibility, lightness, and excellent strength put them in the class of materials that attract attention in various critical areas, i.e., aerospace, defense, automotive, and shipbuilding. However, the machining of composite materials displays challenges due to the difficulty in obtaining structural integrity. In this study, Cu/Mo-SiCP composite materials were produced by powder metallurgy with varied reinforcement ratios and then their machinability was investigated. In machinability experiments, the process parameters were selected as cutting speed (vC), feed rate (f), depth of cut (aP), and reinforcement ratio (RR). Two levels of these parameters were taken as per the Taguchi’s L8 orthogonal array, and response surface methodology (RSM) is employed for parametric optimization. As a result, the outcomes demonstrated that RR = 5%, f = 0.25 mm/rev, aP = 0.25 mm, vC = 200 m/min for surface roughness, RR = 0%, f = 0.25 mm/rev and aP = 0.25 mm and vC = 200 m/min for flank wear and RR = 0%, f = 0.25 mm/rev, aP = 0.25 mm, vC = 150 m/min for cutting temperature for cutting temperature and flank wear should be selected for the desired results. In addition, ANOVA results indicate that reinforcement ratio is the dominant factor on all response parameters. Microscope images showed that the prominent failure modes on the cutting tool are flank wear, built up edge, and crater wear depending on reinforcement ratio.},

ABSTRACT = {A stochastic data-driven multilevel finite-element (FE2) method is introduced for random nonlinear multiscale calculations. A hybrid neural-network–interpolation (NN–I) scheme is proposed to construct a surrogate model of the macroscopic nonlinear constitutive law from representative-volume-element calculations, whose results are used as input data. Then, a FE2 method replacing the nonlinear multiscale calculations by the NN–I is developed. The NN–I scheme improved the accuracy of the neural-network surrogate model when insufficient data were available. Due to the achieved reduction in computational time, which was several orders of magnitude less than that to direct FE2, the use of such a machine-learning method is demonstrated for performing Monte Carlo simulations in nonlinear heterogeneous structures and propagating uncertainties in this context, and the identification of probabilistic models at the macroscale on some quantities of interest. Applications to nonlinear electric conduction in graphene–polymer composites are presented.},

ABSTRACT = {Lightweight alloys made from aluminium are used to manufacture cars, trains and planes. The main parts most often manufactured from thin sheets requiring the use of milling in the manufacturing process are front panels for control systems, housing parts for electrical and electronic components. As a result of the final phase of the manufacturing process, cold rolling, residual stresses remain in the surface layers, which can influence the cutting processes carried out on these materials. The main aim of this study was to verify whether the strategy of removing the outer material layers of aluminium alloy sheets affects the surface roughness after the face milling process. EN AW-6082-T6 aluminium alloy thin plates with three different thicknesses and with two directions relative to the cold rolling process direction (longitudinal and transverse) were analysed. Three different strategies for removing the outer layers of the material by face milling were considered. Noticeable differences in surface roughness 2D and 3D parameters were found among all machining strategies and for both rolling directions, but these differences were not statistically significant. The lowest values of Ra = 0.34 µm were measured for the S#3 strategy, which asymmetrically removed material from both sides of the plate (main and back), for an 8-mm-thick plate in the transverse rolling direction. The highest values of Ra = 0.48 µm were measured for a 6-mm-thick plate milled with the S#2 strategy, which symmetrically removed material from both sides of the plate, in the longitudinal rolling direction. However, the position of the face cutter axis during the machining process was observed to have a significant effect on the surface roughness. A higher surface roughness was measured in the areas of the tool point transition from the up-milling direction to the down-milling direction (tool axis path) for all analysed strategies (Ra = 0.63–0.68 µm). The best values were obtained for the up-milling direction, but in the area of the smooth execution of the process (Ra = 0.26–0.29 µm), not in the area of the blade entry into the material. A similar relationship was obtained for analysed medians of the arithmetic mean height (Sa) and the root-mean-square height (Sq). However, in the case of the S#3 strategy, the spreads of results were the lowest.},

ABSTRACT = {In order to provide a second economic life to agave fibers, an important waste material from the production of tequila, filaments based on polylactic acid (PLA) were filled with agave fibers (0, 3, 5, 10 wt%), and further utilized to produce biocomposites by fused deposition modeling (FDM)-based 3D printing at two raster angles (−45°/45° and 0°/90°). Differential scanning calorimetry, water uptake, density variation, morphology, and composting of the biocomposites were studied. The mechanical properties of the biocomposites (tensile, flexural, and Charpy impact properties) were determined following ASTM international norms. The addition of agave fibers to the filaments increased the crystallinity value from 23.7 to 44.1%. However, the fibers generated porous structures with a higher content of open cells and lower apparent densities than neat PLA pieces. The printing angle had a low significant effect on flexural and tensile properties, but directly affected the morphology of the printed biocomposites, positively influenced the impact strength, and slightly improved the absorption values for biocomposites printed at −45°/45°. Overall, increasing the concentrations of agave fibers had a detrimental effect on the mechanical properties of the biocomposites. The disintegration of the biocomposites under simulated composting conditions was slowed 1.6-fold with the addition of agave fibers, compared to neat PLA.},

ABSTRACT = {The purpose of the following study was to compare the effect of the shape of a tool on the joint and to obtain the values of Friction Stir Welding (FSW) parameters that provide the best possible joint quality. The material used was an aluminium alloy, EN AW-3004 (AlMn1Mg1). To the authors’ best knowledge, no investigations of this alloy during FSW have been presented earlier. Five butt joints were made with a self-developed, cylindrical, and tapered threaded tool with a rotational speed of 475 rpm. In order to compare the welding parameters, two more joints with a rotational speed of 475 rpm and seven joints with a welding speed of 300 mm/min with the use of a cylindrical threaded pin were performed. This involved a visual inspection as well as a tensile strength test of the welded joints. It was observed that the value of the material outflow for the joints made with the cylindrical threaded pin was higher than it was for the joints made with the tapered threaded pin. However, welding defects in the form of voids appeared in the joints made with the tapered threaded tool. The use of the cylindrical tool resulted in higher values for about 37% of mechanical properties compared with the highest result for the tapered threaded joint. As far as the parameters were concerned, it was concluded that most of the specimens were properly joined for a rotational speed of 475 rpm. In the joints made with a welding speed of 300 mm/min, the material was not stirred properly. The best joint quality was given for a rotational speed of 475 rpm as well as a variety of welding speed values between 150 and 475 mm/min.},

ABSTRACT = {Porous Lattice Structure (PLS) scaffolds have shown potential applications in the biomedical domain. These implants’ structural designs can attain compatibility mechanobiologically, thereby avoiding challenges related to the stress shielding effect. Different unit cell structures have been explored with limited work on the fabrication and characterization of titanium-based PLS with cubic unit cell structures. Hence, in the present paper, Ti6Al4V (Ti64) cubic PLS scaffolds were analysed by finite element (FE) analysis and fabricated using selective laser melting (SLM) technique. PLS of the rectangular shape of width 10 mm and height 15 mm (ISO: 13314) with an average pore size of 600–1000 μm and structure porosity percentage of 40–70 were obtained. It has been found that the maximum ultimate compressive strength was found to be 119 MPa of PLS with a pore size of 600 μm and an overall relative density (RD) of 57%. Additionally, the structure’s failure begins from the micro-porosity formed during the fabrication process due to the improper melting along a plane inclined at 45 degree.},

ABSTRACT = {Tribological properties of engineering components are a key issue due to their effect on the operational performance factors such as wear, surface characteristics, service life and in situ behavior. Thus, for better component quality, process parameters have major importance, especially for metal matrix composites (MMCs), which are a special class of materials used in a wide range of engineering applications including but not limited to structural, automotive and aeronautics. This paper deals with the tribological behavior of Cu-B-CrC composites (Cu-main matrix, B-CrC-reinforcement by 0, 2.5, 5 and 7.5 wt.%). The tribological characteristics investigated in this study are the coefficient of friction, wear rate and weight loss. For this purpose, four levels of sliding distance (1000, 1500, 2000 and 2500 m) and four levels of applied load (10, 15, 20 and 25 N) were used. In addition, two levels of sliding velocity (1 and 1.5 m/s), two levels of sintering time (1 and 2 h) and two sintering temperatures (1000 and 1050 °C) were used. Taguchi’s L16 orthogonal array was used to statistically analyze the aforementioned input parameters and to determine their best levels which give the desired values for the analyzed tribological characteristics. The results were analyzed by statistical analysis, optimization and 3D surface plots. Accordingly, it was determined that the most effective factor for wear rate, weight loss and friction coefficients is the contribution rate. According to signal-to-noise ratios, optimum solutions can be sorted as: the highest levels of parameters except for applied load and reinforcement ratio (2500 m, 10 N, 1.5 m/s, 2 h, 1050 °C and 0 wt.%) for wear rate, certain levels of all parameters (1000 m, 10 N, 1.5 m/s, 2 h, 1050 °C and 2.5 wt.%) for weight loss and 1000 m, 15 N, 1 m/s, 1 h, 1000 °C and 0 wt.% for the coefficient of friction. The comprehensive analysis of findings has practical significance and provides valuable information for a composite material from the production phase to the actual working conditions.},

This dissimilar joint is essential in power generating nuclear and thermal plants operating at 600–650 °C. In such critical operating conditions, it is essential for a dissimilar joint to preserve its characteristics and be free from any kind of defect. The difference between the physical properties of P91 and Incoloy 800HT makes their weldability challenging. Thus, the need for detailed characterization of this dissimilar weld arises. The present work intends to explore the usage of an unconventional welding process (i.e., laser beam welding) and its effect on the joint’s characteristics. The single-pass laser welding technique was employed to obtain maximum penetration through the keyhole mode. The welded joint morphology and mechanical properties were studied in as-welded (AW) and post-weld heat treatment (PWHT) conditions. The macro-optical examination shows the complete penetrations with no inclusion and porosities in the weld. The microstructural study was done in order to observe the precipitation and segregation of elements in dendritic and interface regions. Solidification cracks were observed in the weld fusion zone, confirming the susceptibility of Incoloy 800HT to such cracks due to a mismatch between the melting point and thermal conductivity of the base metals. Failure from base metal was observed in tensile test results of standard AW specimen with a yield stress of 265 MPa, and after PWHT, the value increased to 297 MPa. The peak hardness of 391 HV was observed in the P91 coarse grain heat-affected zone (CGHAZ), and PWHT confirmed the reduction in hardness. The impact toughness results that were obtained were inadequate, as the maximum value of impact toughness was obtained for AW P91 heat-affected zone (HAZ) 108 J and the minimum for PWHT Incoloy 800HT HAZ 45 J. Thus, difficulty in obtaining a dissimilar joint with Incoloy 800HT using the laser beam welding technique was observed due to its susceptibility to solidification cracking.},

ABSTRACT = {The mechanical, physical and interfacial properties of aluminum alloys are improved by reinforcing the silicon carbide particles (SiCp). Machinability of such alloys by traditional methods is challenging due to higher tool wear and surface roughness. The objective of research is to investigate the machinability of SiCp reinforced Al6061 composite by Wire-Electrical Discharge Machining (wire-EDM). The effect of wire-EDM parameters namely current (I), pulse-on time (Ton), wire-speed (Ws), voltage (Iv) and pulse-off time (Toff) on material removal rate (MRR) is investigated and their settings are optimized for achieving the high MRR. The experiments are designed by using Taguchi L16 orthogonal arrays. The MRR obtained at different experiments are analyzed using statistical tools. It is observed that all the chosen process parameters showed significant influence of on the MRR with contribution of 27.39%, 22.08%, 21.32%, 15.76% and 12.94% by I, Iv, Toff, Ton and Ws, respectively. At optimum settings, the Wire-EDM resulted in MRR of 65.21 mg/min and 62.41 mg/min for samples with 4% and 8% SiCp. The results also indicated reinforcing SiCp upto 8% showed marginally low influence on MRR. Microstructural investigation of the cut surface revealed the presence of craters with wave pattern on its surface. The top surface of the crater is featured by the recast layers connecting adjacent craters. Further, the statistical model is developed using linear regression to predict the MRR (?2—73.65%) and its predicting accuracy is verified by the confirmation trials. The statistical model is useful for predicting the MRR for different settings of the process parameters. The optimized settings can be used to improve the machining productivity by increasing the MRR while machining of Al6061-SiCp (upto 8 wt. %) alloy by wire-EDM industries.},

ABSTRACT = {Siliceous fly ash (FA) is the main additive to currently produced concretes. The utilization of this industrial waste carries an evident pro-ecological factor. In addition, such actions have a positive effect on the structure and mechanical parameters of mature concrete. Unfortunately, the problem of using FA as a Portland cement replacement is that it significantly reduces the performance of concretes in the early stages of their curing. This limits the possibility of using this type of concrete, e.g., in prefabrication, where it is required to obtain high-strength composites after short periods of curing. In order to minimize these negative effects, this research was undertaken to increase the early strength of concretes with FA through the application of a specifically formulated chemical nano-admixture (NA) in the form of seeds of the C-S-H phase. The NA was used to accelerate the strength growth in concretes. Therefore, this paper presents results of tests of modified concretes both with the addition of FA and with innovative NA. The analyses were carried out based on the results of the macroscopic and microstructural tests in five time periods, i.e., after 4, 8, 12, 24 and 72 h. The results of tests carried out with the use of NA clearly indicate the possibility of using FA in a wide range of management areas in sustainable concrete prefabrication.},

ABSTRACT = {This article deals with the dissimilar joining of two different grade Cr-Mo steel (2.25Cr-1Mo: P22 and modified 9Cr-1Mo: P91) for power plant application. The dissimilar butt-welded joint was produced for conventional V groove design by using the gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW) process with the application of an ERNiCrMo-3 Ni-based super alloy filler. A microstructure characterization was performed to measure the inhomogeneity in the microstructure and element diffusion across the interface in a welded joint. The experiments were also performed to evaluate the mechanical properties of the dissimilar welded joint in as-welded (AW) and post-weld heat treatment (PWHT) conditions. An acceptable level of the mechanical properties was obtained for the AW joint. After PWHT, a significant level of the element diffusion across the interface of the weld metal and P22 steel was observed, resulting in heterogeneity in microstructure near the interface, which was also supported by the hardness variation. Inhomogeneity in mechanical properties (impact strength and hardness) was measured across the weldments for the AW joint and was reduced after the PWHT. The tensile test results indicate an acceptable level of tensile properties for the welded joint in both AW and PWHT conditions and failure was noticed in the weak region of the P22 steel instead of the weld metal.},

ABSTRACT = {The enormous use of cutting fluid in machining leads to an increase in machining costs, along with different health hazards. Cutting fluid can be used efficiently using the MQL (minimum quantity lubrication) method, which aids in improving the machining performance. This paper contains multiple responses, namely, force, surface roughness, and temperature, so there arises a need for a multicriteria optimization technique. Therefore, in this paper, multiobjective optimization based on ratio analysis (MOORA), VIseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR), and technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) are used to solve different multiobjective problems, and response surface methodology is also used for optimization and to validate the results obtained by multicriterion decision-making technique (MCDM) techniques. The design of the experiment is based on the Box–Behnken technique, which used four input parameters: feed rate, depth of cut, cutting speed, and nanofluid concentration, respectively. The experiments were performed on AISI 304 steel in turning with minimum quantity lubrication (MQL) and found that the use of hybrid nanofluid (Alumina–Graphene) reduces response parameters by approximately 13% in forces, 31% in surface roughness, and 14% in temperature, as compared to Alumina nanofluid. The response parameters are analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA), where the depth of cut and feed rate showed a major impact on response parameters. After using all three MCDM techniques, it was found that, at fixed weight factor with each MCDM technique, a similar process parameter was achieved (velocity of 90 m/min, feed of 0.08 mm/min, depth of cut of 0.6 mm, and nanoparticle concentration of 1.5%, respectively) for optimum response. The above stated multicriterion techniques employed in this work aid decision makers in selecting optimum parameters depending upon the desired targets. Thus, this work is a novel approach to studying the effectiveness of hybrid nanofluids in the machining of AISI 304 steel using MCDM techniques.},

ABSTRACT = {First-principles density functional theory (DFT) is employed to study the electronic structure of oxygen and gallium vacancies in monoclinic bulk β-Ga2O3 crystals. Hybrid exchange–correlation functional B3LYP within the density functional theory and supercell approach were successfully used to simulate isolated point defects in β-Ga2O3. Based on the results of our calculations, we predict that an oxygen vacancy in β-Ga2O3 is a deep donor defect which cannot be an effective source of electrons and, thus, is not responsible for n-type conductivity in β-Ga2O3. On the other hand, all types of charge states of gallium vacancies are sufficiently deep acceptors with transition levels more than 1.5 eV above the valence band of the crystal. Due to high formation energy of above 10 eV, they cannot be considered as a source of p-type conductivity in β-Ga2O3.},

ABSTRACT = {Titanium and its alloys exhibit numerous uses in aerospace, automobile, biomedical and marine industries because of their enhanced mechanical properties. However, the machinability of titanium alloys can be cumbersome due to their lower density, high hardness, low thermal conductivity, and low elastic modulus. The wire electrical discharge machining (WEDM) process is an effective choice for machining titanium and its alloys due to its unique machining characteristics. The present work proposes multi-objective optimization of WEDM on Ti6Al4V alloy using a fuzzy integrated multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach. The use of MCDM has become an active area of research due to its proven ability to solve complex problems. The novelty of the present work is to use integrated fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and fuzzy technique for order preference by similarity to ideal situation (TOPSIS) to optimize the WEDM process. The experiments were systematically conducted adapting the face-centered central composite design approach of response surface methodology. Three independent factors—pulse-on time (Ton), pulse-off time (Toff), and current—were chosen, each having three levels to monitor the process response in terms of cutting speed (VC), material removal rate (MRR), and surface roughness (SR). To assess the relevance and significance of the models, an analysis of variance was carried out. The optimal process parameters after integrating fuzzy AHP coupled with fuzzy TOPSIS approach found were Ton = 40 µs, Toff = 15 µs, and current = 2A.},

ABSTRACT = {The re-entrant honeycomb microstructure is one of the most famous, typical examples of an auxetic structure. The re-entrant geometries also include other members as, among others, the star re-entrant geometries with various symmetries. In this paper, we focus on one of them, having a 6-fold symmetry axis. The investigated systems consist of binary hard discs (two-dimensional particles with two slightly different sizes, interacting through infinitely repulsive pairwise potential), from which different structures, based on the mentioned geometry, were formed. To study the elastic properties of the systems, computer simulations using the Monte Carlo method in isobaric-isothermal ensemble with varying shape of the periodic box were performed. The results show that all the considered systems are isotropic and not auxetic—their Poisson’s ratio is positive in each case. Moreover, Poisson’s ratios of the majority of examined structures tend to +1 with increasing pressure, which is the upper limit for two-dimensional isotropic media, thus they can be recognized as the ideal non-auxetics in appropriate thermodynamic conditions. The results obtained contradict the common belief that the unique properties of metamaterials result solely from their microstructure and indicate that the material itself can be crucial.},

ABSTRACT = {This article studied the effects of pin angle on heat generation and temperature distribution during friction stir welding (FSW) of AA1100 aluminum alloy and St-14 low carbon steel. A validated computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model was implemented to simulate the FSW process. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was employed in order to investigate internal materials’ flow. Simulation results revealed that the mechanical work on the joint line increased with the pin angle and larger stir zone forms. The simulation results show that in the angled pin tool, more than 26% of the total heat is produced by the pin. Meanwhile, in other cases, the total heat produced by the pin was near 15% of the total generated heat. The thermo-mechanical cycle in the steel zone increased, and consequently, mechanical interlock between base metals increased. The simulation output demonstrated that the frictional heat generation with a tool without a pin angle is higher than an angled pin. The calculation result also shows that the maximum heat was generated on the steel side.},

ABSTRACT = {Bending stiffness (BS) is one of the two most important mechanical parameters of corrugated board. The second is edge crush resistance (ECT). Both are used in many analytical formulas to assess the load capacity of corrugated cardboard packaging. Therefore, the correct determination of bending stiffness is crucial in the design of corrugated board structures. This paper focuses on the analytical determination of BS based on the known parameters of the constituent papers and the geometry of the corrugated layers. The work analyzes in detail the dependence of the bending stiffness of an asymmetric, five-layer corrugated cardboard on the sample arrangement. A specimen bent so that the layers on the lower wave side are compressed has approximately 10% higher stiffness value. This is due to imperfections, which are particularly important in the case of compression of very thin liners. The study showed that imperfection at the level of a few microns causes noticeable drops in bending stiffness. The method has also been validated by means of experimental data from the literature and simple numerical finite element model (FEM). The obtained compliance of the computational model with the experimental model is very satisfactory. The work also included a critical discussion of the already published data and observations of other scientists in the field.},

Experimental tests were carried out at ambient temperature and elevated temperature during which adhesive butt joints were loaded with a tensile force until failure. The variables were the mix ratio of epoxy adhesive components and the application of heat holding at the adhesive curing stage. An LSTM (long short-time memory) forecast was used to determine the point corresponding to the mix ratio of adhesive components at which heat holding of the adhesive joint no longer has a positive and significant importance to the final tensile strength of the joint.},

ABSTRACT = {The optimal selection of the composition of corrugated cardboard dedicated to specific packaging structures is not an easy task. The use of lighter boards saves material, but at the same time increases the risk of not meeting the guaranteed load capacity. Therefore, the answer to the question “in which layer the basis weight of the paper should be increased?” is not simple or obvious. The method proposed here makes it easy to understand which components and to what extent they affect the load-bearing capacity of packages of various dimensions. The use of numerical homogenization allows for a quick transformation of a cardboard sample, i.e., a representative volume element (RVE) into a flat plate structure with effective parameters describing the membrane and bending stiffness. On the other hand, the use of non-local sensitivity analysis makes it possible to find the relationship between the parameters of the paper and the load capacity of the packaging. The analytical procedures presented in our previous studies were used here to determine (1) the edge crush resistance, (2) critical load, and (3) the load capacity of corrugated cardboard packaging. The method proposed here allows for obtaining a comprehensive and hierarchical list of the parameters that play the most important role in the process of optimal packaging design.},

ABSTRACT = {In this study, the ballistic impact behavior of auxetic sandwich composite human body armor was analyzed using finite element analysis. The auxetic core of the armor was composed of discrete re-entrant unit cells. The sandwich armor structure consisted of a front panel of aluminum alloy (Al 7075-T6), UHMWPE (sandwich core), and a back facet of silicon carbide (SiC) bonded together with epoxy resin. Numerical simulations were run on Explicit Dynamics/Autodyne 3-D code. Various projectile velocities with the same boundary conditions were used to predict the auxetic armor response. These results were compared with those of conventional monolithic body armor. The results showed improved indentation resistance with the auxetic armor. Deformation in auxetic armor was observed greater for each of the cases when compared to the monolithic armor, due to higher energy absorption. The elastic energy dissipation results in the lower indentation in an auxetic armor. The armor can be used safely up to 400 m/s; being used at higher velocities significantly reduced the threat level. Conversely, the conventional monolithic modal does not allow the projectile to pass through at a velocity below 300 m/s; however, the back face becomes severely damaged at 200 m/s. At a velocity of 400 m/s, the front facet of auxetic armor was destroyed; however, the back facet was completely safe, while the monolithic panel did not withstand this velocity and was completely damaged. The results are encouraging in terms of resistance offered by the newly adopted auxetic armor compared to conventional monolithic armor.},

Following that, drilling tests were undertaken on glass bead/fiber-reinforced hybrid Polyamide 66 (PA66) polymer composites. The purpose of this study is to determine the mechanical properties of the cutting elements and the effect of cutting parameters (spindle speed and feed rate) and reinforcement ratios on thrust force and surface roughness (Ra). The contribution of the cutting parameters to the investigated outcomes was determined using statistical analysis. Optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to inspect the hole quality and damage mechanisms. The results revealed that the feed rate was the most contributing factor to thrust force (96.94%) and surface roughness (63.59%). Furthermore, in comparison to other hybrid composites, the lowest Ra value was obtained as 0.95 µm in samples containing 30% GB, while the Ra value was 1.04 µm in samples containing 10% GF + 20% GB. Polymer PA reinforced with 30% GF had the highest strength, modulus of elasticity, impact strength, and hardness.},

ABSTRACT = {Accurate life prediction and reliability evaluation of lithium-ion batteries are of great significance for predictive maintenance. In the whole life cycle of a battery, the accurate description of the dynamic and stochastic characteristics of life has always been a key problem. In this paper, the concept of the digital twin is introduced, and a digital twin for reliability based on remaining useful cycle life prediction is proposed for lithium-ion batteries. The capacity degradation model, stochastic degradation model, life prediction, and reliability evaluation model are established to describe the randomness of battery degradation and the dispersion of the life of multiple cells. Based on the Bayesian algorithm, an adaptive evolution method for the model of the digital twin is proposed to improve prediction accuracy, followed by experimental verification. Finally, the life prediction, reliability evaluation, and predictive maintenance of the battery based on the digital twin are implemented. The results show the digital twin for reliability has good accuracy in the whole life cycle. The error can be controlled at about 5% with the adaptive evolution algorithm. For battery L1 and L6 in this case, predictive maintenance costs are expected to decrease by 62.0% and 52.5%, respectively.},

The first class comprises granodiorite and tonalite (I-type) and is ascribed to volcanic arc, whereas the second one includes alkali-feldspar granite, syenogranite, and albitized granite with high-K calc alkaline character, which is related to post-orogenic granites. 238U, 226Ra, 232Th, and 40K activities of natural radionuclides occurring in the examined rocks were measured radiometrically using sodium iodide detector. Furthermore, assessment of the hazard indices—such as: annual effective dose (AED) with mean values (0.11, 0.09, 0.07, 0.05, and 0.03, standard value = 0.07); gamma radiation index (Iγ) with mean values (0.6, 0.5, 0.4, 0.3, and 0.14, standard value = 0.5); internal (Hin) with mean values (0.6, 0.5, 0.4, 0.3, and 0.2, standard value = 1.0); external (Hex) index (0.5, 0.4, 0.3, 0.24, and 0.12, standard value = 1.0); absorbed gamma dose rate (D) with mean values (86.4, 75.9, 53.5, 43.6, and 20.8, standard value = 57); and radium equivalent activity (Raeq) with mean values (180, 154, 106.6, 90.1, and 42.7, standard value = 370)—were evaluated with the knowledge of the natural radionuclides. The result of these indices falls within the acceptable worldwide limits. Therefore, we suggest that these rocks are safe to be used in industrial applications.},

ABSTRACT = {Aerospace alloys with reduced wall thickness but possessing higher hardness, good tensile strength and reasonable corrosion resistance are essential in manufacturing of structures such as fuselage. In this work, friction stir welding has been carried out on such an aerospace aluminum alloy AA8090 T87 which contains 2.3% lithium. Tool rotational speed of 900 rpm and traverse speeds of 90 mm/min., 110 mm/min. are the welding parameters. Hardness analysis, surface roughness analysis and corrosion analysis are conducted to analyze the suitability of the joint for the intended application. The samples were corrosion tested in acid alkali solution and they resulted in the formation of pits of varying levels which indicate the extent of surface degradation. Hardness of the samples was measured after corrosion analysis to observe the changes. The analysis suggests that the change in tool traverse speed transformed the corrosion behavior of the joint and affected both the hardness and surface roughness which mitigated the quality of the joint.},

ABSTRACT = {Graphene has been widely and extensively used in mass sensing applications. The present study focused on exploring the use of single-layer graphene (SLG) and double-layer graphene (DLG) as sensing devices. The dynamic analysis of SLG and DLG with different boundary conditions (BDs) and length was executed using the atomistic finite element method (AFEM). SLG and DLG sheets were modelled and considered as a space–frame structure similar to a 3D beam. Spring elements (Combin14) were used to identify the interlayer interactions between two graphene layers in the DLG sheet due to the van der Waals forces. Simulations were carried out to visualize the behavior of the SLG and DLG subjected to different BDs and when used as mass sensing devices. The variation in frequency was noted by changing the length and applied mass of the SLGs and DLGs. The quantity of the frequency was found to be highest in the armchair SLG (6, 6) for a 50 nm sheet length and lowest in the chiral SLG (16, 4) for a 20 nm sheet length in the bridged condition. When the mass was 0.1 Zg, the frequency for the zigzag SLG (20, 0) was higher in both cases. The results show that the length of the sheet and the various mass values have a significant impact on the dynamic properties. The present research will contribute to the ultra-high frequency nano-resonance applications.},

ABSTRACT = {This study presents test results and in-depth discussion regarding the measurement of the fracture mechanics parameters of new concrete composites based on quaternary blended cements (QBC). A composition of the two most commonly used mineral additives, i.e., fly ash (FA) and silica fume (SF), in combination with nanosilica (nS), has been proposed as a partial replacement for ordinary Portland cement (OPC) binder. Four series of concrete were made, one of which was the reference concrete (REF) and the remaining three were QBC. During the research, the main mechanical parameters of compressive strength (fcm) and splitting tensile strength (fctm), as well as fracture mechanics parameters and the critical stress intensity factor KIcS, along with critical crack-tip opening displacements (CTODc) were investigated. Based on the tests, it was found that the total addition of siliceous materials, i.e., SF + nS without FA, increases the strength and fracture parameters of concrete by approximately 40%. On the other hand, supplementing the composition of the binder with SF and nS with 5% of FA additive causes an increase in all mechanical parameters by approximately 10%, whereas an increase by another 10% in the FA content in the concrete mix causes a significant decrease in all the analyzed factors by 10%, compared to the composite with the addition of silica modifiers only.},
