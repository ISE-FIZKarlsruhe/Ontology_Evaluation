ABSTRACT = {The interface between filler and hydration products can have a significant effect on the mechanical properties of the cement paste system. With different adhesion properties between filler and hydration products, the effect of microstructural features (size, shape, surface roughness), particle distribution and area fraction of filler on the fracture behavior of a blended cement paste system is supposed to be different, as well. In order to understand the effect of the microstructural features, particle distribution and area fraction of filler on the fracture behavior of a blended cement paste system with either strong or weak filler-matrix interface, microscale simulations with a lattice model are carried out. The results show that the strength of the filler-matrix interface plays a more important role than the microstructural features, particle distribution and area fraction of filler in the crack propagation and the strength of blended cement paste. The knowledge acquired here provides a clue, or direction, for improving the performance of existing fillers. To improve the performance of fillers in cement paste in terms of strength, priority should be given to improving the bond strength between filler particles and matrix, not to modifying the microstructural features (i.e., shape and surface roughness) of the filler.},

ABSTRACT = {We investigate 29Si nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) chemical shifts, δiso, of silicon nitride. Our goal is to relate the local structure to the NMR signal and, thus, provide the means to extract more information from the experimental 29Si NMR spectra in this family of compounds. We apply structural modeling and the gauge-included projector augmented wave (GIPAW) method within density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Our models comprise known and hypothetical crystalline Si3N4, as well as amorphous Si3N4 structures. We find good agreement with available experimental 29Si NMR data for tetrahedral Si[4] and octahedral Si[6] in crystalline Si3N4, predict the chemical shift of a trigonal-bipyramidal Si[5] to be about −120 ppm, and quantify the impact of Si-N bond lengths on 29Si δiso. We show through computations that experimental 29Si NMR data indicates that silicon dicarbodiimide, Si(NCN)2 exhibits bent Si-N-C units with angles of about 143° in its structure. A detailed investigation of amorphous silicon nitride shows that an observed peak asymmetry relates to the proximity of a fifth N neighbor in non-bonding distance between 2.5 and 2.8 Å to Si. We reveal the impact of both Si-N(H)-Si bond angle and Si-N bond length on 29Si δiso in hydrogenated silicon nitride structure, silicon diimide Si(NH)2.},

ABSTRACT = {The phase-field-crystal (PFC) method is used to investigate migration of grain boundary dislocation and dynamic of strain-driven nucleation and growth of deformed grain in two dimensions. The simulated results show that the deformed grain nucleates through forming a gap with higher strain energy between the two sub-grain boundaries (SGB) which is split from grain boundary (GB) under applied biaxial strain, and results in the formation of high-density ensembles of cooperative dislocation movement (CDM) that is capable of plastic flow localization (deformed band), which is related to the change of the crystal lattice orientation due to instability of the orientation. The deformed grain stores the strain energy through collective climbing of the dislocation, as well as changing the orientation of the original grain. The deformed grain growth (DGG) is such that the higher strain energy region extends to the lower strain energy region, and its area increase is proportional to the time square. The rule of the time square of the DGG can also be deduced by establishing the dynamic equation of the dislocation of the strain-driven SGB. The copper metal is taken as an example of the calculation, and the obtained result is a good agreement with that of the experiment.},

ABSTRACT = {Anomalous eutectic morphologies were observed during laser remelting of a Ni-Sn powder bed, where it was sandwiched between a lamellar eutectic at the bottom of melt pool. That is, the anomalous eutectic growth mechanism can be divided into two processes: one is the lamellar to anomalous transition (LAT); the other is the anomalous to lamellar transition (ALT). The thermal distribution at the bottom of melt pool is simulated by the finite difference method. It is found that the cooling rate at the bottom of melt pool is a linear function of time. A cellular automaton (CA) model is developed to simulate the anomalous growth. Simulation results show that the mechanism of the LAT is that one phase overgrows the other followed by subsequent nucleating of the other phase. The mechanism of the ALT is the competitive growth between the anomalous and lamellar eutectic; as the cooling rate increased, the lamellar eutectic is more competitive.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, the mechanical properties and minimum thermal conductivity of ZnZr, Zn2Zr, Zn2Zr3, and MgZn2 are calculated from first principles. The results show that the considered Zn-Zr intermetallic compounds are effective strengthening phases compared to MgZn2 based on the calculated elastic constants and polycrystalline bulk modulus B, shear modulus G, and Young’s modulus E. Meanwhile, the strong Zn-Zr ionic bondings in ZnZr, Zn2Zr, and Zn2Zr3 alloys lead to the characteristics of a higher modulus but lower ductility than the MgZn2 alloy. The minimum thermal conductivity of ZnZr, Zn2Zr, Zn2Zr3, and MgZn2 is 0.48, 0.67, 0.68, and 0.49 W m−1 K−1, respectively, indicating that the thermal conductivity of the Mg-Zn-Zr alloy could be improved as the precipitation of Zn atoms from the α-Mg matrix to form the considered Zn-Zr binary alloys. Based on the analysis of the directional dependence of the minimum thermal conductivity, the minimum thermal conductivity in the direction of [110] can be identified as a crucial short limit for the considered Zn-Zr intermetallic compounds in Mg-Zn-Zr alloys.},

ABSTRACT = {We proposed and fabricated a flexible, planar, U-shape-modified structure metamaterial (MM) that was composed of two metallic pattern layers separated by a polyimide layer, where each metallic pattern layer consists of two U-shaped split ring resonators (USRRs). The coupling effect between the two USRRs in the same metallic layer was vital to the formation of dual toroidal dipole (TD) resonances. The measured and simulated results showed that both low quality factor (Q) (~1.82) and high Q (~10.31) TD resonances were acquired synchronously at two different frequencies in the MMs by adjusting the distance between the two coplanar USRRs. With the interaction of the USRRs, the energy levels of the USRRs were split into inductance-capacitance (LC)-induced TD resonance at low frequency and dipole-induced TD resonance at high frequency. Thus, the electric multipole interaction played an important role in determining the energy level of the TD resonance. The better strength of the high frequency TD resonance can be confined to an electromagnetic field inside a smaller circular region, and thus, a higher Q was obtained. In order to investigate the TD mechanism more in depth, the power of the electric dipole, magnetic dipole, electric circular dipole, and TD were quantitatively calculated. Dual TD MMs on a freestanding substrate will have potential applications in functional terahertz devices for practical applications.},

ABSTRACT = {In this work, we assess the effects of sterilization in materials manufactured using additive manufacturing by employing a sterilization technique used in the food industry. To estimate the feasibility of the hydrostatic high-pressure (HHP) sterilization of biomedical devices, we have evaluated the mechanical properties of specimens produced by commercial 3D printers. Evaluations of the potential advantages and drawbacks of Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM), Digital Light Processing (DLP) technology, and Stereolithography (SLA) were considered for this study due to their widespread availability. Changes in mechanical properties due to the proposed sterilization technique were compared to values derived from the standardized autoclaving methodology. Enhancement of the mechanical properties of samples treated with Hydrostatic high-pressure processing enhanced mechanical properties, with a 30.30% increase in the tensile modulus and a 26.36% increase in the ultimate tensile strength. While traditional autoclaving was shown to systematically reduce the mechanical properties of the materials employed and damages and deformation on the surfaces were observed, HHP offered an alternative for sterilization without employing heat. These results suggest that while forgoing high-temperature for sanitization, HHP processing can be employed to take advantage of the flexibility of additive manufacturing technologies for manufacturing implants, instruments, and other devices.},

ABSTRACT = {The present work describes the mechanical characterization combined with the thermal degradation kinetics of Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymers (CFRP). The thermal degradation kinetics of CFRP have never been studied in the past. In that regard, the present work focuses on studying the thermal degradation kinetics of CFRP tested mechanically at different environmental conditions. Tensile tests were performed on the specimens with different lay-ups at room temperature, elevated temperature (71 °C), and cryogenic conditions (−54 °C), and the same specimens were used for thermal degradation kinetic studies. Mechanical tests show different responses respect to the different environmental conditions and different fibers orientation. On the other hand, the thermogravimetric results, mass loss, and derivative mass loss, show no significant difference in the degradation of CFRP tested at different temperatures. However, the thermal degradation kinetics shows more insight into the degradation pattern of the materials. The activation energy of degradation shows that the degradation of materials subjected to elevated conditions increases rapidly in the later stages of degradation, suggesting the formation of high char yield. The varying activation energy has been related to different degradation mechanisms. Lastly, the morphology of the materials was studied under SEM to understand the structural change in the material after tested in different weather conditions.},

ABSTRACT = {The cohesive zone model (CZM) has found wide acceptance as a tool for the simulation of delamination in composites and debonding in bonded joints and various implementations of the cohesive zone model dedicated to fatigue problems have been proposed in the past decade. In previous works, the authors have developed a model based on cohesive zone to simulate the propagation of fatigue defects where damage acts on cohesive stiffness, with an initial (undamaged) stiffness representative of that of the entire thickness of an adhesive layer. In the case of a stiffness that is order of magnitude higher than the previous one (for instance, in the simulation of the ply-to-ply interface in composites), the model prediction becomes inaccurate. In this work, a new formulation of the model that overcomes this limitation is developed. Finite element simulations have been conducted on a mode I, constant bending (constant G)-loaded double cantilever beam (DCB) joint to assess the response of the new model with respect to the original one for varying initial stiffness K0 and cohesive strength σ0. The results showed that the modified model is robust with respect to changes of two orders of magnitude in initial stiffness and of a factor of two in σ0.},

ABSTRACT = {The diffusion of composite materials in aeronautical and aerospace applications is attributable to the high specific mechanical properties they offer. In particular, the recent use of Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) materials is highly increased. The main disadvantage in using this kind of material is related to the possibility of including damages or defects not visible on the surface that compromise their behavior and make their use extremely unsafe if not properly supervised. The most conventional nondestructive techniques allow the detection of damages when they already compromise the life of these materials. The use of the same techniques makes it harder to monitor in-situ of the progress of damages, especially if they occur inside the materials. The implementation of the innovative strain analysis method, like those based on full-field measurements, could provide additional information about the damage mechanisms by supplying the complete strain distribution of the surface of the sample. The present paper examines the mechanical behavior of two different CFRP specimens, with and without damage, subjected to compressive load in an anti-buckling fixture by using the Digital Image Correlation (DIC). The purpose is to measure the out-of-plane displacements, characteristics of the compression tests, in all the points of the ROI (Region of Interest), using a full-field and noncontact technique. The innovative aspect of this work is therefore to solve this problem through an experimental approach with DIC 3D technique.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper presents a numerical and experimental analysis of manufacturing of intermetallic ceramic composites by powder metallurgy techniques. The scope of the paper includes the formulation and development of an original numerical model of powder metallurgy of two-phase material within the framework of the discrete element method, simulations of powder metallurgy processes for different combinations of process parameters, and a verification of the numerical model based on own experimental results. Intermetallic-based composite NiAl–Al 2 O 3 has been selected as representative material for experimental and numerical studies in this investigation. Special emphasis was given to the interactions between the intermetallic and ceramic particles by formulating the special model for adhesive contact bond. In order to properly represent a real microstructure of a two-phase sintered body, a discrete element specimen was generated using a special algorithm. Numerical validation showed the correct numerical representation of a sintered two-phase composite specimen. Finally, micromechanical analysis was performed to explain the macroscopic behavior of the sintered sample. The evolution of the coordination number, a number of equilibrium contacts, and the distribution of the cohesive neck size with respect to time are presented.},

ABSTRACT = {Using carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) composites for enhancing the fatigue behavior of the steel structures will be an important application. As the most critical part, the fatigue behavior of the CFRP-to-steel bonded interface directly determines the strengthening effect of steel structures reinforced by CFRP. In this paper, a series of CFRP-to-steel double-shear specimens are performed in order to study the interfacial bond behavior between CFRP and steel under fatigue loading. Two parameters are considered: the upper bound value and the lower bound value of the fatigue loading. An analysis of test results indicates that the crack development rate increases with the increment of the stress ratio or stress level and the crack development process includes two phases: crack stable development phase and debonding failure phase. A calculation model is put forward to describe the relationship between the crack development rate and the stress level. Besides, it can be obtained from the test results that the fatigue lives of the specimens decrease with the increment of the stress level. The empirical formula of S-N curve based on the form of single logarithm formula is proposed and the fatigue limit under the experimental conditions in this paper is determined to be 0.343 by computational analysis.},

ABSTRACT = {In the last decades, the increasing use of laminate materials, such as carbon fibre reinforced plastics, in several engineering applications has pushed researchers to deeply investigate their mechanical behavior, especially in consideration of the delamination process, which could affect their performance. The need for improving the capability of the current instruments in predicting some collapse or strength reduction due to hidden damages leads to the necessity to combine numerical models with experimental campaigns. The validation of the numerical models could give useful information about the mechanical response of the materials, providing predictive data about their lifetime. The purpose of the delamination tests is to collect reliable results by monitoring the delamination growth of the simulated in situ cracking and use them to validate the numerical models. In this work, an experimental campaign was carried out on high performance composite laminates with respect to the delamination mode I; subsequently, a numerical model representative of the experimental setup was built. The ANSYS Workbench Suite was used to simulate the delamination phenomena and modeFRONTIER was applied for the numerical/experimental calibration of the constitutive relationship on the basis of the delamination process, whose mechanism was implemented by means of the cohesive zone material (CZM) model.},

ABSTRACT = {Triple-layered composite plates are created by joining three composite layers using shear connectors. These layers, which are assumed to be always in contact and able to move relatively to each other during deformation, could be the same or different in geometric dimensions and material. They are applied in various engineering fields such as ship-building, aircraft wing manufacturing, etc. However, there are only a few publications regarding the calculation of this kind of plate. This paper proposes novel equations, which utilize Mindlin’s theory and finite element modelling to simulate the forced vibration of triple-layered composite plates with layers connected by shear connectors subjected to a moving load. Moreover, a Matlab computation program is introduced to verify the reliability of the proposed equations, as well as the influence of some parameters, such as boundary conditions, the rigidity of the shear connector, thickness-to-length ratio, and the moving load velocity on the dynamic response of the composite plate.},

ABSTRACT = {The shrinkage of reinforced polymer composites in injection molding varies, depending on the properties of the reinforcing agent. Therefore, the study of optimal reinforcement conditions, to minimize shrinkage when talc and glass fibers (GF) (which are commonly used as reinforcements) are incorporated into polypropylene (PP), is required. In this study, we investigated the effect of reinforcement factors, such as reinforcement type, reinforcement content, and reinforcement particle size, on the shrinkage, and optimized these factors to minimize the shrinkage of the PP composites. We measured the shrinkage of injection-molded samples, and, based on the measured values, the optimal conditions were obtained through analysis of variance (ANOVA), the Taguchi method, and regression analysis. It was found that reinforcement type had the largest influence on shrinkage among the three factors, followed by reinforcement content. In contrast, the reinforcement size was not significant, compared to the other two factors. If the reinforcement size was set as an uncontrollable factor, the optimum condition for minimizing directional shrinkage was the incorporation of 20 wt % GF and that for differential shrinkage was the incorporation of 20 wt % talc. In addition, a shrinkage prediction method was proposed, in which two reinforcing agents were incorporated into PP, for the optimization of various dependent variables. The results of this study are expected to provide answers about which reinforcement agent should be selected and incorporated to minimize the shrinkage of PP composites.},

ABSTRACT = {The mechanical characterization of textile composites is a challenging task, due to their nonuniform deformation and complicated failure phenomena. This article introduces a three-dimensional mesoscale finite element model to investigate the progressive damage behavior of a notched single-layer triaxially-braided composite subjected to axial tension. The damage initiation and propagation in fiber bundles are simulated using three-dimensional failure criteria and damage evolution law. A traction–separation law has been applied to predict the interfacial damage of fiber bundles. The proposed model is correlated and validated by the experimentally measured full field strain distributions and effective strength of the notched specimen. The progressive damage behavior of the fiber bundles is studied by examining the damage and stress contours at different loading stages. Parametric numerical studies are conducted to explore the role of modeling parameters and geometric characteristics on the internal damage behavior and global measured properties of the notched specimen. Moreover, the correlations of damage behavior, global stress–strain response, and the efficiency of the notched specimen are discussed in detail. The results of this paper deliver a throughout understanding of the damage behavior of braided composites and can help the specimen design of textile composites.},

ABSTRACT = {The behavior of nap-core sandwiches was investigated with a special focus on the effect of symmetry in nap cores. A nap-core is, in general terms, a 3D-formed hollow structure made of knitted textile impregnated by a thermosetting resin. The molding process determines if the nap-core is double-sided (symmetric) or single-sided. The sandwich with nap-core owns various remarkable properties of a novel lightweight material, but the nap-core’s complex structure makes the prediction of these properties a difficult task. While the analysis of a single-sided nap-core sandwich has been presented by the authors before, this study is focused on the simulation of symmetric nap-core sandwich. Overall, performance of the structure is examined with respect to several loading conditions. The simulation approach invokes a typical homogenization scheme to find the engineering properties of the nap-core’s fabric with least computational time and memory resources. Results from experiments and simulations exhibit a good compatibility, which prove the fitness of the modeling method.},

ABSTRACT = {Accelerated construction in the form of steel–concrete composite beams is among the most efficient methods to construct highway bridges. One of the main problems with this type of composite structures, which has not yet been fully clarified in the case of continuous beam, is the crack zone initiation that gradually expands through the beam width. In the current study, a semi-empirical model was proposed to predict the size of cracks in terms of small box girder deflection and intensity of load applied on the structure. To this end, a set of steel–concrete composite small box girders were constructed by the use of steel fibrous concrete and experimentally tested under different caseloads. The results were then used to create a dataset of the box girder response in terms of beam deflection and crack width. The obtained dataset was then utilized to develop a simplified formula providing the maximum width of cracks. The results showed that the cracks initiated in the hogging moment region when the load exceeded 80 kN. Additionally, it was observed that the maximum cracked zone occurred in the center of the beam due to the maximum negative moment. Moreover, the crack width of the box girder at different loading cases was compared with the test results obtained from the literature. A good agreement has been found between the proposed model and experiment results.},

ABSTRACT = {The performance characterization of the manufacturing processes for additive manufacturing (AM) systems is a significant task for their standardization and implementation in the industry. Also, there is a large diversity of materials used in different AM processes. In the present paper, a methodology is proposed to evaluate, in different directions, the performance of an AM process and material characterization in terms of surface quality. This methodology consists of eight steps, based on a new surface inspection artifact and basic artifact orientations. The proposed artifact with several design configurations fits different AM systems sizes and meets the needs of customers. The effects of main factors on the surface roughness of up-facing platens of the artifacts are investigated using the statistical design of experiments. The proposed methodology is validated by a case study focused on PolyJet material jetting technology. Samples are manufactured of photopolymer resins and post-processed. Three factors (i.e., artifact orientation, platen orientation, and finish type) are considered for the investigation. The case study results show that the platen orientation, finish type, and their interaction have a significant influence on the surface roughness (Ra). The best Ra roughness results were obtained for the glossy finish type in the range of 0.5–4 μm.},

ABSTRACT = {This research concerning the topic, pursues the design, manufacturing, analysis and testing of the manhole cover that may be used in pedestrian networks. Although there are certain commercially available manhole covers made of glass-reinforced composites, there are a few papers published related to the modelling, simulation and mechanical testing of such parts. Herein, the manhole cover is made of the sandwich composite. The novelty of this kind of cover is to use an oriented strand board (OSB) as the core between two sides containing layers, which are reinforced with glass fibers. The OSB core leads to the increase of the stiffness-weight ratio. The paper describes the materials corresponding to the layers of the composite cover, geometry of the cover, technology used to manufacture the bending specimens and cover tested. Specimens made of materials that correspond to each layer of the cover, are tested in bending in order to determine their mechanical properties (flexural strength and flexural modulus). Bending tests and testing of the cover are also described. The composite manhole cover is also analysed by the finite element method to obtain the state of stresses and strains. The strains of the manhole cover are experimentally measured by using the tensometric method. Finally, comparing the strains with the strains experimentally measured validates the numerical simulation model.},

ABSTRACT = {Although well-recognized in the fields of structural and material design and widely present in engineering literature, topology optimization still arouses a high interest within research communities. Moreover, it is observed that the development of innovative, efficient and versatile methods is one of the most important issues stimulating progress within the topology optimization area. Following this activity, in the present study, a concept of a hybrid algorithm developed in order to generate optimal structural topologies of minimal compliance is presented. The hybrid algorithm is built based on two existing approaches. The first one makes use of the formal optimality criterion, whereas the second one utilizes a special heuristic rule of design variables updating. The main idea that stands behind the concept of the present proposal is to take the advantage of both algorithms capabilities. In a numerical implementation of the hybrid algorithm, the design variables are updated at each iteration step using both approaches, and the solution with a lower objective function value is selected for the next iteration. The numerical tests of the generation of minimal compliance structures have been performed for chosen structures including a real engineering one. It has been confirmed that the proposed hybrid technique based on switching between the considered rules allows the final structures having lower values of compliance as compared with the results of an application of basic algorithms running separately to be obtained. Moreover, based on promising results of the tests performed, one can consider the proposed concept of a hybrid algorithm as an alternative for other existing topology generators.},

ABSTRACT = {Smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) and the finite element method (FEM) are often combined with the scope to model the interaction between structures and the surrounding fluids (FSI). There is the case, for instance, of aircrafts crashing on water or speedboats slamming into waves. Due to the high computational complexity, the influence of air is often neglected, limiting the analysis to the interaction between structure and water. On the contrary, this work aims to specifically investigate the effect of air when merged inside the fluid–structure interaction (FSI) computational models. Measures from experiments were used as a basis to validate estimations comparing results from models that include or exclude the presence of air. Outcomes generally showed a great correlation between simulation and experiments, with marginal differences in terms of accelerations, especially during the first phase of impact and considering the presence of air in the model.},

The influence of boundary conditions, form of a representative volume element, shape and distribution of reinforcement are distinguished as having the crucial influence on a design of the reinforcement. The paper also shows that, in the optimization problems, the distributions of any design variables can be expressed by n-dimensional curves. It applies not only to the tasks of optimizing the shape of the edge of the structure or its mid-surface but also dimensional optimization or topology/material optimization. It is shown that the design of reinforcement may be conducted in different ways and 2D approaches may be expanding to 3D cases.},

ABSTRACT = {In the example of oxygen diffusion in dilute ferritic iron alloys it is shown that the calculation of the diffusion coefficient can be separated into a contribution related to the migration in the interaction region between oxygen and the substitutional solute and a part related to diffusion in pure body centered cubic (bcc) Fe. The corresponding diffusion times are determined by analytical expressions using Density-Functional-Theory (DFT) data for the respective binding energies. The diffusion coefficient in the interaction region must be determined by atomistic kinetic Monte Carlo (AKMC) simulations with DFT values for the migration barriers as input data. In contrast to previous calculations, AKMC simulation must only be performed for one concentration of the substitutional solute, and the obtained results can be employed to obtain data for other concentrations in a very efficient manner. This leads to a tremendous decrease of computational efforts. Under certain conditions it is even possible to use analytical expressions where merely DFT data for the binding energies are needed. The limits of applicability of the presented calculation procedures are discussed in detail. The methods presented in this work can be generalized to interstitial diffusion in other host materials with small concentrations of substitutional solutes.},

ABSTRACT = {The following paper describes a new and effective method to obtain high-density sinters with simultaneously decreased distortions, produced by one press and sinter operation. This effect was achieved through the induced disappearance of the eutectic liquid phase. The study was carried out on AISI 316L stainless steel powder that was mixed with elemental boron and silicon nitride. Boron was used as a sintering process activator. The scientific novelty of this publication consists of the use of a silicon nitride as a solid-state nitrogen carrier that was intended to change the borides’ morphology by binding boron. Based on the thermodynamic calculations, 20 blends of various compositions were tested for physical properties, porosity, microstructure, and mechanical properties. Moreover, phase compositions for selected samples were analyzed. It was shown that the addition of silicon nitride as a nitrogen carrier decreases the boron-based eutectic phase volume and both increases the mechanical properties and decreases after-sintering distortions. An explanation of the observed phenomena was also proposed.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, the skin–stringer separation phenomenon that occurs in stiffened composite panels under compression is numerically studied. Since the mode I fracture toughness and, consequently, the skin–stringer separation can be influenced by the fibre bridging phenomenon at the skin–stringer interface, in this study, comparisons among three different material systems with different fibre bridging sensitivities have been carried out. Indeed, a reference material system has been compared, in terms of toughness performance, against two materials with different degrees of sensitivity to fibre bridging. A robust numerical procedure for the delamination assessment has been used to mimic the skin–stringer separation. When analysing the global compressive behaviour of the stiffened panel, intra-laminar damages have been considered in conjunction with skin–stringer debonding to evaluate the effect of the fibre and matrix breakage on the separation between the skin and the stringer for the three analysed material systems. The latter are characterised by different toughness characteristics and fibre bridging sensitivities, resulting in a different material toughness.},

ABSTRACT = {Typical artificial joints for humanoid robots use actual human body joints only as an inspiration. The load responses of these structures rarely match those of the corresponding joints, which is important when applying the robots in environments tailored to humans. In this study, we proposed a novel, automated method for designing substitutes for a human intervertebral joint. The substitutes were considered as two platforms, connected by a set of flexible links. Their structural and material parameters were obtained through optimization with a structured Genetic Algorithm, based on the reference angular stiffnesses. The proposed approach was tested in three numerical scenarios. In the first test, a mechanism with angular stiffnesses corresponded to the actual L4–L5 intervertebral joint. Scenarios 2 and 3 featured mechanisms with geometry and structure comparable to the joint, but with custom stiffness profiles. The obtained results proved the effectiveness of the proposed method. It could be employed in the design of artificial joints for humanoid robots and orthotic structures for the human spine. As the approach is general, it could also be extended to different body joints.},

ABSTRACT = {Elevated temperature exposure has a negative effect on the performance of the matrix resin in Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastics (CFRP) plates, whereas limited quantitative research focuses on the deteriorations. Therefore, 30 CFRP specimens were designed and tested under elevated temperatures (10, 30, 50, 70, and 90 °C) to explore the degradations in tensile properties. The effect of temperature on the failure mode, stress-strain curve, tensile strength, elastic modulus and elongation of CFRP plates were investigated. The results showed that elevated temperature exposure significantly changed the failure characteristics. When the exposed temperature increased from 10 °C to 90 °C, the failure mode changed from the global factures in the whole CFRP plate to the successive fractures in carbon fibers. Moreover, with temperatures increasing, tensile strength and elongation of CFRP plates decreases gradually while the elastic modulus shows negligible change. Finally, the results of One-Way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) show that the degradation of the tensile strength of CFRP plates was due to the impact of elevated temperature exposure, rather than the test error.},

ABSTRACT = {The effect of the Ni/Si mass ratio and combined thermomechanical treatment on the microstructure and properties of ternary Cu-Ni-Si alloys is discussed systematically. The Cu-Ni-Si alloy with a Ni/Si mass ratio of 4–5 showed good comprehensive properties. Precipitates with disc-like shapes were confirmed as the Ni2Si phase with orthorhombic structure through transmission electron microscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, and 3D atom probe characterization. After the appropriate thermomechanical treatment, the studied alloy with a Ni/Si mass ratio of 4.2 exhibited excellent mechanical properties: a hardness of 290 HV, tensile strength of 855 MPa, yield strength of 782 MPa, and elongation of 4.5%. Compared with other approaches, the thermomechanical treatment increased the hardness and strength without sacrificing electrical conductivity. Theoretical calculations indicated that the high strength was primarily attributed to the Orowan precipitation strengthening and secondarily ascribed to the work hardening, which were highly consistent with the experimental results. The appropriate Ni/Si mass ratio with a low content of Ni and Si atoms shows high strength and excellent electrical conductivity through combined thermomechanical treatment. This work provides a guideline for the design and preparation of multicomponent Cu-Ni-Si-X alloys with ultrahigh strength and excellent electrical conductivity.},

ABSTRACT = {In this study, the effect of the impact angle of a projectile during low-velocity impact on Kevlar fabrics has been investigated using a simplified numerical model. The implementation of mesoscale models is complex and usually involves long computation time, in contrast to the practical industry needs to obtain accurate results rapidly. In addition, when the simulation includes more than one layer of composite ply, the computational time increases even in the case of hybrid models. With the goal of providing useful and rapid prediction tools to the industry, a simplified model has been developed in this work. The model offers an advantage in the reduced computational time compared to a full 3D model (around a 90% faster). The proposed model has been validated against equivalent experimental and numerical results reported in the literature with acceptable deviations and accuracies for design requirements. The proposed numerical model allows the study of the influence of the geometry on the impact response of the composite. Finally, after a parametric study related to the number of layers and angle of impact, using a response surface methodology, a mechanistic model and a surface diagram have been presented in order to help with the calculation of the ballistic limit.},

The proposed beam element is free of shear-looking without selective or reduced integration. The material properties of the functionally graded beam are assumed to vary according to the power-law index of the volume fraction of the constituents through the thickness of the beam. The numerical results of this study are compared with published results to illustrate the accuracy and convenience rate of the new beam element.

ABSTRACT = {Fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) materials nowadays have attracted much attention in both retrofitting of aged infrastructure and developing of new structural systems attributed to the outstanding mechanical properties. Extensive studies have been performed on concrete-filled glass FRP (GFRP) tubes for the potential application in piling, poles, highways overhead sign structures and bridge components. The new hybrid member also provides an alternative solution for traditional transmission structures. However, the connection between concrete-filled GFRP tubes and cross arms has not been fully understood. In this paper, an experimental study and theoretical analysis were conducted on the behavior of cross arms inserted in concrete-filled circular GFRP tubular columns. Steel bars with a larger stiffness in comparison with GFRP tubes were selected here for the cross arm to simulate a more severe scenario. The structural responses of the system when the cross arms were subjected to concentrated loads were carefully recorded. Experimental results showed that the concrete-filled GFRP tubes could offer a sufficient restraint to the deformation of the cross arm. No visible cracks were found on the GFRP tube at the corner of the cross arm where the stress and strain concentrated. Theoretical solutions based on available theories and equations were adopted to predict the displacement of the cross arms and a good agreement was achieved between the prediction results and experimental findings.},

ABSTRACT = {The effectiveness of a model is the key factor of influencing the reliability-based design optimization (RBDO) of multi-failure turbine blades in the power system. A machine learning-based RBDO approach, called fuzzy multi-SVR learning method, was proposed by absorbing the strengths of fuzzy theory, support vector machine of regression (SVR), and multi-response surface method. The model of fuzzy multi-SVR learning method was established by adopting artificial bee colony algorithm to optimize the parameters of SVR models and considering the fuzziness of constraints based on fuzzy theory, in respect of the basic thought of multi-response surface method. The RBDO model and procedure with fuzzy multi-SVR learning method were then resolved and designed by multi-objective genetic algorithm. Lastly, the fuzzy RBDO of a turbine blade with multi-failure modes was performed regarding the design parameters of rotor speed, temperature, and aerodynamic pressure, and the design objectives of blade stress, strain, and deformation, and the fuzzy constraints of reliability degree and boundary conditions, as well. It is revealed (1) the stress and deformation of turbine blade are reduced by 92.38 MPa and 0.09838 mm, respectively. (2) The comprehensive reliability degree of the blade was improved by 3.45% from 95.4% to 98.85%. (3) It is verified that the fuzzy multi-SVR learning method is workable for the fuzzy RBDO of complex structures just like a multi-failure blade with high modeling precision, as well as high optimization, efficiency, and accuracy. The efforts of this study open a new research way, i.e., machine learning-based RBDO, for the RBDO of multi-failure structures, which expands the application of machine learning methods, and enriches the mechanical reliability design method and theory as well.},

ABSTRACT = {The aim of the study was to assess the selected properties of a hybrid organic–inorganic silane sol–gel coating (HSG) used in hybrid fiber metal laminates (FML) in a corrosion environment. The HSG coating on the aluminum alloy was produced using 3M™ AC130-2 formulation consisting of 3-glycidoxypropyl-trimethoxysilane (GPTMS) and tetra-n-propoxyzirconium (zirconium(IV) propoxide) (TPOZ). Laminates consisted of aluminum alloy AA2024-T3 sheets, with carbon fiber reinforced polymers (CFRPs) and a glass fiber reinforced metal–composite structure (GFRP). Potentiodynamic and polarization curve and impedance (EIS) tests were carried out on HSG at ambient temperatures after 1 h and 150 h of soaking. Neutral 0.5 M NaCl and 0.8 M NaCl solutions were used for open circuit potential (OCP) and potentiodynamic tests, and 0.5 NaCl was used for the EIS test. A neutral salt spray (NSS) test was applied to laminates with a 12 week exposure period. The results obtained revealed that the HSG coating did not provide sufficient protection against corrosion of the aluminum alloy in direct contact with an aggressive environment but was effective as an interlayer. Local aluminum sheet perforation did not lead to delamination at the metal–composite interface regardless of the type or configuration of the composite. This confirms the durability of HSG used in FMLs.},

ABSTRACT = {Coal contains a large number of fractures, whose characteristics are difficult to describe in detail, while their spatial distribution patterns may follow some macroscopic statistical laws. In this paper, several fracture geometric parameters (FGPs) were used to describe a fracture, and the coal seam was represented by a two-dimensional stochastic fracture network (SFN) which was generated and processed through a series of methods in MATLAB. Then, the processed SFN image was able to be imported into COMSOL Multiphysics and converted to a computational domain through the image function. In this way, the influences of different FGPs and their distribution patterns on the permeability of the coal seam were studied, and a finite element model to investigate gas flow properties in the coal seam was carried out. The results show that the permeability of the coal seam increased with the rising of fracture density, length, aperture, and with the decrease of the angle between the fracture orientation and the gas pressure gradient. It has also been found that large-sized fractures have a more significant contribution to coal reservoir permeability. Additionally, a numerical simulation of CBM extraction was carried out to show the potential of the proposed approach in the application of tackling practical engineering problems. According to the results, not only the connectivity of fractures but also variations of gas pressure and velocity can be displayed explicitly, which is consistent well with the actual situation.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, a research activity, focused on the investigation of new reinforcements able to improve the toughness of composite materials systems, is introduced. The overall aim is to delay the delamination propagation and, consequently, to increase the carrying load capability of composite structures by exploiting the fiber bridging effects. Indeed, the influence of fiber bridging related Mode I fracture toughness (GIc) values on the onset and propagation of delaminations in stiffened composite panels, under three-point bending loading conditions, have been experimentally and numerically studied. The investigated stiffened panels have been manufactured by using epoxy resin/carbon fibers material systems, characterized by different GIc values, which can be associated with the material fiber bridging sensitivity. Experimental data, in terms of load and delaminated area as a function of the out-of-plane displacements, have been obtained for each tested sample. Non-Destructive Inspection (NDI) has been performed to identify the debonding extension and position. To completely understand the evolution of the delamination and its dependence on the material characteristics, experiments have been numerically simulated using a newly developed robust numerical procedure for the delamination growth simulation, able to take into account the influence of the fracture toughness changes, associated with the materials’ fiber bridging sensitivity. The combined use of numerical results and experimental data has allowed introducing interesting considerations of the capability of the fiber bridging to substantially slow down the evolution of the debonding between skin and reinforcements in composite stiffened panels.},

ABSTRACT = {The paper aims to investigate the natural frequencies of sandwich plates by means of a Finite Element (FE) formulation based on the Reissner-Mindlin Zig-zag (RMZ) theory. The structures are made of a damaged isotropic soft-core and two external stiffer orthotropic face-sheets. These skins are strengthened at the nanoscale level by randomly oriented Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and are reinforced at the microscale stage by oriented straight fibers. These reinforcing phases are included in a polymer matrix and a three-phase approach based on the Eshelby-Mori-Tanaka scheme and on the Halpin-Tsai approach, which is developed to compute the overall mechanical properties of the composite material. A non-uniform distribution of the reinforcing fibers is assumed along the thickness of the skin and is modeled analytically by means of peculiar expressions given as a function of the thickness coordinate. Several parametric analyses are carried out to investigate the mechanical behavior of these multi-layered structures depending on the damage features, through-the-thickness distribution of the straight fibers, stacking sequence, and mass fraction of the constituents. Some final remarks are presented to provide useful observations and design criteria.},

ABSTRACT = {Metal additive manufacturing can produce geometrically complex parts with effective cost. The high thermal gradients due to the repeatedly rapid heat and solidification cause defects in the produced parts, such as cracks, porosity, undesired residual stress, and part distortion. Different techniques were employed for temperature investigation. Experimental measurement and finite element method-based numerical models are limited by the restricted accessibility and expensive computational cost, respectively. The available physics-based analytical model has promising short computational efficiency without resorting to finite element method or any iteration-based simulations. However, the heat transfer boundary condition cannot be considered without the involvement of finite element method or iteration-based simulations, which significantly reduces the computational efficiency, and thus the usefulness of the developed model. This work presents an explicit and closed-form solution, namely heat sink solution, to consider the heat transfer boundary condition. The heat sink solution was developed from the moving point heat source solution based on heat transfer of convection and radiation. The part boundary is mathematically discretized into many heats sinks due to the non-uniform temperature distribution, which causes non-uniform heat loss. The temperature profiles, thermal gradients, and temperature-affected material properties are calculated and presented. Good agreements were observed upon validation against experimental molten pool measurements.},

ABSTRACT = {Plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition (PEALD) is a widely used, powerful layer-by-layer coating technology. Here, we present an atomistic simulation scheme for PEALD processes, combining the Monte Carlo deposition algorithm and structure relaxation using molecular dynamics. In contrast to previous implementations, our approach employs a real, atomistic model of the precursor. This allows us to account for steric hindrance and overlap restrictions at the surface corresponding to the real precursor deposition step. In addition, our scheme takes various process parameters into account, employing predefined probabilities for precursor products at each Monte Carlo deposition step. The new simulation protocol was applied to investigate PEALD synthesis of SiO2 thin films using the bis-diethylaminosilane precursor. It revealed that increasing the probability for precursor binding to one surface oxygen atom favors amorphous layer growth, a large number of –OH impurities, and the formation of voids. In contrast, a higher probability for precursor binding to two surface oxygen atoms leads to dense SiO2 film growth and a reduction of –OH impurities. Increasing the probability for the formation of doubly bonded precursor sites is therefore the key factor for the formation of dense SiO2 PEALD thin films with reduced amounts of voids and –OH impurities.},

ABSTRACT = {The ankle is one of the most complicated joints in the human body. Its features a plethora of elements with complex behavior. Their functions could be better understood using a planar model of the joint with low parameter count and low numerical complexity. In this study, an accurate planar model of the ankle with optimized material parameters was presented. In order to obtain the model, we proposed an optimizational approach, which fine-tuned the material parameters of two-dimensional links substituting three-dimensional ligaments of the ankle. Furthermore, the cartilage in the model was replaced with Hertzian contact pairs. The model was solved in statics under moment loads up to 5 Nm. The obtained results showed that the structure exhibited angular displacements in the range of the ankle joint and that their range was higher in dorsiflexion than plantarflexion. The structure also displayed a characteristic ramp up of the angular stiffness. The results obtained from the optimized model were in accordance with the experimental results for the ankle. Therefore, the proposed method for fine-tuning the material parameters of its links could be considered viable.},

ABSTRACT = {The domain wall (DW) dynamics of amorphous and nanocrystalline Co-based glass-coated microwires are explored under the influence of stress annealing. Different annealing profiles have enabled remarkable changes in coercivity and magnetostriction values of Co-based amorphous microwires with initially negative magnitude, allowing induced magnetic bistability in stress-annealed samples and, consequently, high DW velocity has been observed. Similarly, Co-based nanocrystalline microwires with positive magnetostriction and spontaneous bistability have featured high DW velocity. Different values of tensile stresses applied during annealing have resulted in a redistribution of magnetoelastic anisotropy showing a decreasing trend in both DW velocities and coercivity of nanocrystalline samples. Observed results are discussed in terms of the stress dependence on magnetostriction and microstructural relaxation.},

It has a working frequency band from 8.6 GHz to 22.5 GHz, with more than 9 dB RCS reduction. The monostatic RCS reduction has a wider bandwidth of coding diffusion metasurface as compared to the traditional chessboard metasurface. In addition, the bistatic performance of the designed metasurfaces is observed at 15.4 GHz, which shows obvious RCS reduction when compared to a metallic plate of the same size. The simulated and measured result shows the proficiency of the designed metasurface.},

ABSTRACT = {Prestressed monoblock railway sleepers are concrete elements with almost no reinforcement apart from the prestressing wires, which makes them very sensitive to any stress variation that can induce tensile stresses. In recent years, severe longitudinal cracking has been observed in a number of sleepers in hot regions of Spain, even before these elements were put in service. This work studies the problem while considering the thermal variation as the main factor affecting this cracking phenomenon. A non-linear static load-step analysis is applied on a non-linear finite element model to reproduce the problem and, after its experimental validation, the influence of three design parameters of the sleepers are studied: the nature of concrete aggregates, the dowel thickness, and the dowel material. The results show that all these three parameters may have significant influence on the problem, with the dowel material being the most important parameter. When the dowels are made of a material with a high elastic modulus and a high thermal expansion coefficient, the crack opening induced by a realistic thermal variation can reach significant values and result in longitudinal crack propagation. The changes of humidity are not considered in this study because they are beyond the scope of this work.},

ABSTRACT = {Simulation of the material failure under high strain rate conditions is one of the most difficult problems in the finite element analyses, and many researchers have tried to understand and reproduce dynamic material fracture. In this study, we investigate a failure criterion that minimizes the mesh dependency at high strain rates and incorporates the criterion into the Johnson-Cook constitutive relationship by developing a user-defined material model. Impact tests were performed using a gas-gun system in order to investigate the response of the 7075-T651 aluminum plate in high-speed collision. On the other hand, numerical simulations are carried out by considering various element sizes and the relationship between element size and failure strain is inversely obtained using numerical results. By accommodating the relationship into the damage model and implementing in the user-defined material model, mesh dependency is significantly reduced, and sufficient accuracy is achieved with alleviated computational cost than the existing damage model. This study suggests an element size-dependent damage criterion that is applicable for impact simulation and it is expected that the criterion is useful to obtain accurate impact responses with a small computational cost.},

ABSTRACT = {The initial stability of a dental implant is known to be an indicator of osseointegration at immediate loading upon insertion. Implant designs have a fundamental role in the initial stability. Although new designs with advanced surface technology have been suggested for the initial stability of implant systems, verification is not simple because of various assessment factors. Our study focused on comparing the initial stability between two different implant systems via design aspects. A simulated model corresponding to the first molar derived from the mandibular bone was constructed. Biomechanical characteristics between the two models were compared by finite element analysis (FEA). Mechanical testing was also performed to derive the maximum loads for the two implant systems. CMI IS-III active (IS-III) had a more desirable stress distribution than CMI IS-II active (IS-II) in the surrounding bone region. Moreover, IS-III decreased the stress transfer to the nerve under the axial loading direction more than IS-II. Changes of implant design did not affect the maximum load. Our analyses suggest that the optimized design (IS-III), which has a bigger bone volume without loss of initial fixation, may minimize the bone damage during fixture insertion and we expect greater effectiveness in older patients.},

ABSTRACT = {The penetration enhancement behaviors of a reactive material double-layered liner (RM-DLL) shaped charge against thick steel targets are investigated. The RM-DLL comprises an inner copper liner, coupled with an outer PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene)/Al reactive material liner, fabricated via a cold pressing/sintering process. This RM-DLL shaped charge presents a novel defeat mechanism that incorporates the penetration capability of a precursor copper jet and the chemical energy release of a follow-thru reactive material penetrator. Experimental results showed that, compared with the single reactive liner shaped charge jet, a deeper penetration depth was produced by the reactive material-copper jet, whereas the penetration performance and reactive material mass entering the penetrated target strongly depended on the reactive liner thickness and standoff. To further illustrate the penetration enhancement mechanism, numerical simulations based on AUTODYN-2D code were conducted. Numerical results indicated that, with increasing reactive liner thickness, the initiation delay time of the reactive materials increased significantly, which caused the penetration depth and the follow-thru reactive material mass to increase for a given standoff. This new RM-DLL shaped charge configuration provides an extremely efficient method to enhance the penetration damage to various potential targets, such as armored fighting vehicles, naval vessels, and concrete targets.},

ABSTRACT = {Polymers have become indispensable in many engineering applications because of their attractive properties, including low volumetric mass density and excellent resistance to corrosion. However, polymers typically lack in mechanical, thermal, and electrical properties that may be required for certain engineering applications. Therefore, researchers have been seeking to improve properties by modifying polymers with particulate fillers. In the research presented herein, a numerical modeling framework was employed that is capable of predicting the properties of binary or higher order composites with randomly distributed fillers in a polymer matrix. Specifically, mechanical properties, i.e., elastic modulus, Poisson’s ratio, and thermal expansion coefficient, were herein explored for the case of size-distributed spherical filler particles. The modeling framework, employing stochastic finite element analysis, reduces efforts for assessing material properties compared to experimental work, while increasing the level of accuracy compared to other available approaches, such as analytical methods. Results from the modeling framework are presented and contrasted with findings from experimental works available in the technical literature. Numerical predictions agree well with the non-linear trends observed in the experiments, i.e., elastic modulus predictions are within the experimental data scatter, while numerical data deviate from experimental Poisson’s ratio data for filler volume fractions greater than 0.15. The latter may be the result of morphology changes in specimens at higher filler volume fractions that do not comply with modelling assumptions.},

ABSTRACT = {Growing very large size silicon ingots with low dislocation density is a critical issue for the photovoltaic industry to reduce the production cost of the high-efficiency solar cell for affordable green energy. The thermal stresses, which are produced as the result of the non-uniform temperature field, would generate dislocation in the ingot. This is a complicated thermal viscoplasticity process during the cooling process of crystal growth. A nonlinear three-dimensional transient formulation derived from the Hassen-Sumino model (HAS) was applied to predict the number of dislocation densities, which couples the macroscopic viscoplastic deformation with the microscopic dislocation dynamics. A typical cooling process during the growth of very large size (G5 size: 0.84 m × 0.84 m × 0.3 m) Si ingot is used as an example to validate the developed HAS model and the results are compared with those obtained from qualitatively critical resolved shear stress model (CRSS). The result demonstrates that this finite element model not only predicts a similar pattern of dislocation generation with the CRSS model but also anticipate the dislocation density quantity generated in the Si ingot. A modified cooling process is also employed to study the effect of the cooling process on the generation of the dislocation. It clearly shows that dislocation density is drastically decreased by modifying the cooling process. The results obtained from this model can provide valuable information for engineers to design a better cooling process for reducing the dislocation density produced in the Si ingot under the crystal growth process.},

ABSTRACT = {A sophisticated understanding of phase transformations and microstructure evolution is crucial in mechanical property optimization for the newly developed low-cost Ti-35421 (Ti-3Al-5Mo-4Cr-2Zr-1Fe wt.%) titanium alloy. The phase transformations in dual-phase Ti-35421 were studied by experiments and thermo-kinetic modeling. The phase transformation reactions and temperature ranges were determined as β→αlamellar [410–660 °C], αlamellar→β [660–740 °C], αlath→β [740–825 °C]. The Gibbs-Thomson effect and multicomponent diffusivities were proven to be responsible for the distinguishing behaviors of growth and dissolution between two α phases. The aging temperature of 540 °C was optimized based on calculations. It introduced a bimodal microstructure containing stubby α lamellae and β matrix. The mechanical properties of bimodal Ti-35421 were tested and compared with baseline alloy Ti-B19 and other near-β titanium alloys. The 540 °C aged alloy exhibits an optimal combination of mechanical properties with tensile strength of 1313 MPa, yield strength of 1240 MPa, elongation of 8.62%, and fracture toughness of 75.8 MPa·m1/2. The bimodal Ti-35421 shows comparable performance to Ti-B19 but has lower cost in raw materials and processing. The results also demonstrate that thermo-kinetic modeling can effectively be utilized in tailoring microstructure and enhancing mechanical properties.},

ABSTRACT = {Micromechanical fatigue lifetime predictions, in particular for the high cycle fatigue regime, require an appropriate modelling of mean stress effects in order to account for lifetime reducing positive mean stresses. Focus of this micromechanical study is the comparison of three selected fatigue indicator parameters (FIPs), with respect to their applicability to different total strain ratios. In this work, investigations are performed on the modelling and prediction of the fatigue crack initiation life of the martensitic high-strength steel SAE 4150 for two different total strain ratios. First, multiple martensitic statistical volume elements (SVEs) are generated by multiscale Voronoi tessellations. Micromechanical fatigue simulations are then performed on these SVEs by means of a crystal plasticity model to obtain microstructure dependent fatigue responses. In order to account for the material specific fatigue damage zone, a non-local homogenisation scheme for the FIPs is introduced for lath martensitic microstructures. The numerical results of the different non-local FIPs are compared with experimental fatigue crack initiation results for two different total strain ratios. It is concluded that the multiaxial fatigue criteria proposed by Fatemi-Socie is superior for predicting fatigue crack initiation life to the energy dissipation criteria and the accumulated plastic slip criteria for the investigated total strain ratios.},

ABSTRACT = {The hydrogen diffusion in welding was investigated by using thermal-mechanical-hydrogen diffusion sequential coupled procedures based on finite element method. A self-gathering effect induced by the solid-state phase transformation was discovered. Because of the self-gathering effect, the hydrogen concentration in weld metal was accumulated to a peak value which can be larger than the initial hydrogen concentration in molten pool, and subsequently the hydrogen concentration in heat affect zone was redistributed. In multi-pass welding, the gathered effect not only happened inside a weld pass, but also in the inter-pass, which further increased the sensitivity of the hydrogen-assisted cold cracking. Controlling should be adopted to restrain the hydrogen accumulation. Welding stress evolution during the solid-state phase transformation process had limited effect on the hydrogen diffusion.},

ABSTRACT = {Hysteretic behavior of random particulate composite was analyzed using the stochastic finite element method and three independent probabilistic formulations, i.e., generalized iterative stochastic perturbation technique of the tenth order, Monte-Carlo simulation, and semi-analytical method. This study was based on computational homogenization of the representative volume element (RVE), and its main focus was to demonstrate an influence of random stress in constitutive relation to the matrix on the deformation energies stored in the effective (homogenized) medium. This was done numerically for an increasing uncertainty of random matrix admissible stress with a Gaussian probability density function, for which the relations to the energies of the entire composite were approximated via the weighted least squares method algorithm. This composite was made of two phases, a hyper-elastic matrix exhibiting hysteretic behavior and a linear elastic spherical reinforcing particle located centrally in the RVE. The RVE was subjected to a cyclic stretch with an increasing amplitude, and computations of deformation energies were carried out using the finite element method system ABAQUS. A stress–strain history of the homogenized medium has been presented for the extreme and for the mean mechanical properties of the matrix to illustrate the random hysteresis of the given composite. The first four probabilistic moments and coefficients of the RVE deformation energy were determined and have been presented in addition to the input statistical scattering of the admissible stresses.},

ABSTRACT = {To fabricate large-scale or unusually shaped composite structures, pieces of fabric plies can be spliced to match size and shape requirements, forming ply splice structures. The junction of different plies can be considered as a defect in the resulting composite material, affecting the overall mechanical properties. In this paper, unidirectional carbon fiber-reinforced plastic (CFRP) with ply splices was used as a research object to study these potential material defects. The effects of ply splices at different positions on the tensile properties of CFRP and the coupling between position of ply splicing were analyzed. Simultaneously, a finite element model was established to analyze the damage evolution, in which a continuous damage model and a cohesive zone model were used to describe the damage of the composite and interface layers, respectively. The model results were in good agreement with observed experimental results. Our results showed that there were three main factors for this failure mechanism: boundary effects, whether the ply splices were independent, or whether they were close to each other. In short, when two ply splices were located at the edge or independent of each other, the failure mode was first delamination and then fiber fracture, and the tensile strength was high. However, when the two ply splices were close to the edge or close to each other, the failure mode was first local fiber fracture and then delamination damage, and the resulting tensile strength was low. Finally, different reinforcement methods to improve the tensile properties of composites were adopted for the splicing layers at different positions through the analysis via model simulation. The two-side patch repair method was used to reinforce the ply splices on or near the edge. Additionally, increasing the toughness of the adhesive layer was used to reinforce the ply splices that were inside the material. These results showed that the tensile strength was enhanced by these two methods of reinforcement, and the initial damage load was especially increased.},

ABSTRACT = {The loading and the failure mode of metal hexagon bolt joints and metal counter-sunk bolt joints of C/C composites were investigated. The joints were tested for out-of-plane loading at two temperatures (600 °C and 800 °C). The failure morphology of a lap plate was investigated, and the main failure modes were determined. The typical load–displacement curve was characterized and the test was simulated using ABAQUS non-linear finite element software. Furthermore, progressive damage was induced, and comparison of the finite element simulation with the experimental data revealed that the failures mainly occurred in the lower lap plate and were dominated by cracking and delamination of the matrix, accompanied by the pull-out of a small number of piercing fibers. Finally, the influences of the temperature, nut radius, and fixture geometry on the critical load were determined via simulation.},

ABSTRACT = {One ambitious objective of Integrated Computational Materials Engineering (ICME) is to shorten the materials development cycle by using computational materials simulation techniques at different length scales. In this regard, the most important aspects are the prediction of the microstructural evolution during material processing and the understanding of the contributions of microstructural features to the mechanical response of the materials. One possible solution to such a challenge is to apply the Phase Field (PF) method because it can predict the microstructural evolution under the influence of different internal or external stimuli, including deformation. To accomplish this, it is necessary to take into account plasticity or, specifically, non-homogeneous plastic deformation, which is particularly important for investigating the size effects in materials emerging at the micron length scale. In this work, we present quasi-2D simulations of plastic deformation in a face centred cubic system using a finite strain formulation. Our model consists of dislocation-based strain gradient crystal plasticity implemented into a PF code. We apply this model to study the influence of grain size on the mechanical behavior of polycrystals, which includes dislocation storage and annihilation. Furthermore, the initial state of the material before deformation is also considered. The results show that a dislocation-based strain gradient crystal plasticity model can capture the Hall-Petch effect in many aspects. The model reproduced the correct functional dependence of the flow stress of the polycrystal on grain size without assigning any special properties to the grain boundaries. However, the predicted Hall-Petch coefficients are significantly smaller than those found typically in experiments. In any case, we found a good qualitative agreement between our findings and experimental results.},

ABSTRACT = {We have calculated that with the world population projected to increase from 7.5 billion in 2017 to 9.8 in 2050, the next generation (within 33 years) will produce 12,000–13,000 Mt of plastic, and that the yearly consumption will reach 37–40 kilos of plastic per person worldwide. One of the branches of the plastics industry is the production of plastics for agriculture e.g., seed trays and pots. In this paper, novel metakaolin-based geopolymer composites reinforced with cellulosic fibres are presented as an alternative to plastic pots. Materials can be dedicated to agricultural applications, provided they have neutral properties, however, geopolymer paste and its final products have high pH. Therefore, a two-step protocol of neutralisation of the geopolymer foam pots was optimised and implemented. The strength of the geopolymer samples was lower when foams were neutralised. The reinforcement of geopolymers with cellulose clearly prevented the reduction of mechanical properties after neutralisation, which was correlated with the lower volume of pores in the foam and with the cellulose chemical properties. Both, neutralisation and reinforcement with cellulose can also eliminate an efflorescence. Significantly increased plant growth was found in geopolymer pots in comparison to plastic pots. The cellulose in geopolymers resulted in better adsorption and slower desorption of minerals during fertilisation. This effect could also be associated with a lower number of large pores in the presence of cellulose fibres in pots, and thus more stable pore filling and better protection of internal surface interactions.},

ABSTRACT = {The continuous drive towards higher specific power and lower displacement engines in recent years place increasingly higher loads on the internal combustion engine materials. This necessitates a more robust collection of reliable material data for computational fatigue life prediction to develop reliable engines and reduce developmental costs. Monotonic tensile testing and cyclic stress and strain-controlled testing of A356-T7 + 0.5 wt.% Cu cast aluminium alloys have been performed. The uniaxial tests were performed on polished test bars extracted from highly loaded areas of cast cylinder heads. The monotonic deformation tests indicate that the material has an elastic-plastic monotonic response with plastic hardening. The strain controlled uniaxial low cycle fatigue tests were run at multiple load levels to capture the cyclic deformation behaviour and the corresponding fatigue lives. The equivalent stress-controlled fatigue tests were performed to study the influence of the loading mode on the cyclic deformation and fatigue lives. The two types of tests exhibit similar fatigue lives and stress-strain responses indicating minimal influence of the mode of loading in fatigue testing of A356 + T7 alloys. The material exhibits a non-linear deformation behaviour with a mixed isotropic and kinematic hardening behaviour that saturates after the initial few cycles. There exists significant scatter in the tested replicas for both monotonic and cyclic loading.},

ABSTRACT = {Alternative fuels (refuse-derived fuels—RDF) have been a substitute for fossil fuels in cement production for many years. RDF are produced from various materials characterized by high calorific value. Due to the possibility of self-ignition in the pile of stored alternative fuel, treatments are carried out to help protect entrepreneurs against material losses and employees against loss of health or life. The objective of the research was to assess the impact of alternative fuel biodrying on the ability to self-heat this material. Three variants of materials (alternative fuel produced on the basis of mixed municipal solid waste (MSW) and on the basis of bulky waste (mainly varnished wood and textiles) and residues from selective collection waste (mainly plastics and tires) were adopted for the analysis. The novelty of the proposed solution consists in processing the analyzed materials inside the innovative ecological waste apparatus bioreactor (EWA), which results in increased process efficiency and shortening its duration. The passive thermography technique was used to assess the impact of alternative fuel biodrying on the decrease in the self-heating ability of RDF. As a result of the conducted analyses, it was clear that the biodrying process inhibited the self-heating of alternative fuel. The temperature of the stored fuel reached over 60 °C before the biodrying process. However, after the biodrying process, the maximum temperatures in each of the variants were about 30 °C, which indicates a decrease in the activity of microorganisms and the lack of self-ignition risk. The maximum temperatures obtained (>71 °C), the time to reach them (≈4 h), and the duration of the thermophilic phase (≈65 h) are much shorter than in the studies of other authors, where the duration of the thermophilic phase was over 80 h.},

ABSTRACT = {In aircraft engineering, an increase of internal pressure in a hydraulic pipe increases the probability of pipe damage, leading to crack propagation becoming a serious issue. In this study, the extended finite element method (XFEM) is applied to simulate initial crack propagation in hydraulic pipes and to investigate the influence factors. Stress intensity factors are extracted to verify the mesh independence of XFEM, which is based on the level set method and unit decomposition method. A total of 30 finite element models of hydraulic pipes with cracks are established. The distribution of von Mises stress under different initial crack lengths and internal pressures is obtained to analyze the change of load-carrying capacity in different conditions. Then, a total of 300 finite element models of hydraulic pipes with different initial crack sizes and locations are simulated under different working conditions. The relationship between the maximum opening displacement and crack length is analyzed by extracting the opening displacement under different initial crack lengths. The length and depth of the initial crack are changed to analyze the factors affecting crack propagation. The opening size and crack propagation length are obtained in different directions. The results show that radial propagation is more destructive than longitudinal propagation for hydraulic pipes in the initial stage of crack propagation.},

ABSTRACT = {In high-speed precision machining, thermal deformation caused by temperature rise affects the accuracy stability of the machine tool to a significant extent. In order to reduce the thermal deformation of ball screws and improve the accuracy, a new adaptive method based on carbon fiber reinforced plastics (CFRP) was proposed in this study and the thermal deformation of ball screws was determined. By using the sequential coupling method, the thermal–structural coupling analysis of a ball screw was conducted based on the finite element method (FEM). The analysis results were verified through a comparison with the experimental results. Based on the verification, an FE model of the improved ball screw was established to study its thermal characteristics. The key design parameters of the improved ball screw were optimized based on the Kriging model and genetic algorithm (GA). The thermal reduction effect of the improved ball screw was validated through the experimental results. The results indicate that the adaptive method proposed in this research is effective in reducing the thermal deformation of ball screws.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper investigates the progressive damage and failure behavior of unidirectional graphite fiber-reinforced aluminum composites (CF/Al composites) under transverse and longitudinal tensile loadings. Micromechanical finite element analyses are carried out using different assumptions regarding fiber, matrix alloy, and interface properties. The validity of these numerical analyses is examined by comparing the predicted stress-strain curves with the experimental data measured under transverse and longitudinal tensile loadings. Assuming a perfect interface, the transverse tensile strength is overestimated by more than 180% and the transverse fracture induced by fiber failure is unrealistic based on the experimental observations. In fact, the simulation and experiment results indicate that the interface debonding arising from the matrix alloy failure dominates the transverse fracture, and the influence of matrix alloy properties on the mechanical behavior is inconspicuous. In the case of longitudinal tensile testing, however, the characteristic of interface bonding has no significant effect on the macroscopic mechanical response due to the low in-situ strength of the fibers. It is demonstrated that ultimate longitudinal fracture is mainly controlled by fiber failure mechanisms, which is confirmed by the fracture morphology of the tensile samples.},

ABSTRACT = {The present study aimed to optimize the phase constituents and mechanical properties of the spark plasma sintered (SPS) Inconel 718 (IN718) alloy. A series of heat treatment routes were designed based on the phase relations in IN718 and performed for the optimization. The microstructure and phase compositions of the SPS IN718 alloys were examined by using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy disperse spectroscopy (EDS), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The mechanical properties of the samples were characterized at room temperature and at 650 °C. The results showed that large amounts of γ” (Ni3Nb) and γ’ (Ni3(Al, Ti)) strengthening phases precipitated in the IN718 alloy after direct aging (DA) of the as-fabricated sample. Moreover, the mechanical properties of the DA sample were comparable to that of the best one of the solution-treated and aged counterparts. The analysis showed that the rapid sintering and solid solution treatment of the IN718 alloy were achieved simultaneously by SPS. In the case of the SPS IN718 material, the direct aging regime had the same heat treatment effect as the conventional solid solution and aging treatment. This contributes toward improving the production efficiency and reduces manufacturing costs in the actual production process.},

ABSTRACT = {Zr-Cu filler metal is proposed for SiC ceramic under special working conditions, as a novel type of the active filler metal, the difference of physical and chemical properties between SiC ceramic and Zr-Cu filler metal leads to greater residual stress in the joint, which affects the mechanical properties of brazing SiC ceramic joint. Based on the finite element method (FEM) simulation, the residual stress of the joint is simulated to guide the design of Zr-based filler metal and formulation of brazing process. The residual stress distribution of SiC ceramic joints brazed at 1200 °C with different thickness of the filler metal and cooling rate is simulated by ANSYS software. The simulation results of the residual stress are verified by brazing experiments and XRD measurements. The results show that the simulated residual stress of the joint is mainly axial compressive stress. The axial compressive stresses are the lowest when the filler metal thickness is 0.1 mm and the cooling rate is 2 °C /min, and increase with the increase of the filler metal layer thickness and cooling rate. The shear strength of the brazed SiC ceramic joint that achieves the highest with 2 °C /min is about 72 MPa, and then decreases with the increase of cooling rate. The experimental test of residual stress in different locations of the brazed SiC ceramic joint basically coincide with the FEM simulation.},

ABSTRACT = {Wire ropes undergo a fretting fatigue condition when subjected to axial and bending loads. The fretting behavior of wires are classified as line contact and trellis point of contact. The experimental study on the fatigue of wire ropes indicates that most of the failure occurs due to high localized stresses at trellis point of contact. A continuum damage mechanics approach was previously proposed to estimate the fatigue life estimation of wire ropes. The approach majorly depends on the high value of localized stresses as well as the micro-slippage occurs at the contact region. Finite element approach has been used to study radial and axial distribution of stresses and displacement in order to clearly understand the evolution of stresses and existence of relative displacements between neighboring wires under various loading and frictional conditions. The relative movements of contacting wires are more when friction is not considered. In the presence of friction, the relative movement occurs at the boundaries of the contact region. The location of microslip in the presence of friction is backed by the experimental observation stating the crack is initiated at or the outer boundary of the contact spot. The existence of slip is due to different displacement of outer and central wires.},

ABSTRACT = {A microstructure finite element method combining the cohesive zone model (CZM) is used to simulate the mechanical behavior, deformation, and failure of polymer-bonded explosive (PBX) 9501 under quasi-static loading. PBX 9501 consists of Cyclotetramethylene tetranitramine (HMX) filler particles with a random distribution packaged in a polymeric binder. The particle is treated as elastic and the binder as viscoelastic. Cohesive elements with a bilinear softening law are inserted into the particle/binder interface, the HMX particle, and the binder to study the interface’s debonding and failure evolution. Macroscopic stress–strain curves homogenized across the microstructure under tension and compression with different strain rates are basically consistent with the experimental data. The interface debonding approximately vertical to the loading direction is the primary failure mechanism under tension, while shear failure along the interfaces and particle fracture plays a significant role under compression. The effects of interface strengths and strain rates on the performance of PBX 9501 are also evaluated. The tensile and compressive strengths are dependent on the interface strength and strain rate, but the failure paths are insensitive. This model is shown to accurately predict macroscopic responses and improve our understanding of the relationship between the mechanical behavior and microstructure of PBX 9501.},

ABSTRACT = {Purpose: To analyze in vitro the mechanical behavior of five types of complete coverage crowns fabricated from different materials. Materials and methods: Seventy-five full coverage crowns were divided into five groups according to material: Group I, metal core with feldspathic ceramic covering (MC- control group); Group II, zirconia core with feldspathic ceramic covering (CZ); Group III, tetragonal monolithic zirconia (TMZ); Group IV, cubic monolithic zirconia (CMZ); Group V, high molecular weight polymethyl methacrylate (PMMAG) doped with graphene nanoparticles. All crowns underwent in vitro fatiguing by dynamic loading in wet conditions to simulate the masticatory forces to which prosthodontic materials are subject in the oral medium. Lastly, fracture resistance was evaluated by static compression testing. Results: The fracture resistance values obtained were as follows: Group MC, 2443.6 ± 238.6 N; Group CZ, 2095.4 ± 329.2 N; Group TMZ, 2494.6 ± 236.6 N; Group CMZ, 1523.6 ± 325.2 N; and Group PMMAG, 1708.9 ± 386.6 N. Group MC presented higher strength with statistically significant differences in comparison with Groups CZ (P = 0.002), CMZ (P < 0.001), and PMMAG (P < 0.001). Weibull distribution showed less probability of cumulative biomechanical failure in Groups MC and TMZ. Conclusions: Metal-ceramic and tetragonal zirconia showed high fracture resistance, while cubic zirconia and PMMA doped with graphene nanoparticles obtained lower values.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper presents the results of the static tensile and fatigue life tests under rotating bending of round 1.4301 (AISI 304) steel samples. The fatigue tests were carried out on smooth and notched samples with three different rounding angles with a shape factor of 1.4, 2 and 2.6. A fatigue life was determined for samples with different shape factors subject to identical loads. The results showed that the scatter of fatigue test results decreases with an increase in shape factor. To evaluate the cracking properties (cracking mode and mechanism), microstructure and fractographic tests of the fractured samples were carried out.},

ABSTRACT = {Dual phase (DP) steels provide good strength and ductility properties. Nevertheless, their forming capability is limited due to the damage characteristics of their constituting microstructural phases and interfaces. In this work, a specific type of interface is analysed, i.e., prior austenite grain boundaries (PAGBs). In the literature, prior austenite grain boundary fracture has been reported as an important damage mechanism of DP-steels. The influence of the morphology of phase boundaries near the PAGB and the role of the martensite substructure in the vicinity of a PAGB on damage initiation is analysed. The experimentally observed preferred sites of crack nucleation along the PAGB are assessed and clarified. A finite strain rate dependent crystal plasticity model accounting for the anisotropic elasto-plasticity of martensite (and also ferrite) was applied to an idealized volume element approximating a typical small-scale PAGB microstructure. The boundary value problem is solved using a fast Fourier transform (FFT) based spectral solver. The role of crystallography and geometrical features within the volume element is studied using simulations. Results are discussed considering possibly dominant regimes of elasticity and plasticity.},

ABSTRACT = {Magnesium is one of the lightest metals for structural components. It has been used for producing various lightweight cast components, but the application of magnesium sheet plates is less widespread. There are two reasons for this: (i) its poor formability at ambient temperatures; and (ii) insufficient data on its durability, especially for dynamic loading. In this article, an innovative approach to predicting the fatigue life of the AZ31 magnesium alloy is presented. It is based on an energy approach that links the strain–energy density with the fatigue life. The core of the presented methodology is a comprehensive new model for tensile and compressive loading paths, which makes it possible to calculate the strain–energy density of closed hysteresis loops. The model is universal for arbitrary strain amplitudes. The material parameters are determined from several low-cycle fatigue tests. The presented approach was validated with examples of variable strain histories.},

ABSTRACT = {Weft-knitted fabrics offer an excellent formability into complex shapes for composite application. In biaxial weft-knitted fabric, additional yarns are inserted in the warp (wale-wise) and weft (course-wise) directions as a reinforcement. Due to these straight yarns, the mechanical properties of such fabrics are better than those of unreinforced weft-knitted fabrics. The forming process of flat fabrics into 3D preforms is challenging and requires numerical simulation. In this paper, the mechanical behavior of biaxial weft-knitted fabrics is simulated by means of macro- and meso-scale finite element method (FEM) models. The macro-scale modelling approach is based on a shell element formulation and offers reasonable computational costs but has some limitations by the description of fabric mechanical characteristics and forming behavior. The meso-scale modelling approach based on beam elements can describe the fabric’s mechanical and forming characteristics better at a higher computational cost. The FEM models were validated by comparing the results of various simulations with the equivalent experiments. With the help of the parametric models, the forming of biaxial weft-knitted fabrics into complex shapes can be simulated. These models help to predict material and process parameters for optimized forming conditions without the necessity of costly experimental trials.},

It was found that the PSO-BP neural network model was superior to the simple ANNs that were trained by a single algorithm and it is suitable for predicting the CS of GGBFS concrete.},

ABSTRACT = {The density based topology optimization procedure represented by the SIMP (Solid isotropic material with penalization) method is the most common technique to solve material distribution optimization problems. It depends on several parameters for the solution, which in general are defined arbitrarily or based on the literature. In this work the influence of the optimization parameters applied to the design of periodic cellular materials were studied. Different filtering schemes, penalization factors, initial guesses, mesh sizes, and optimization solvers were tested. In the obtained results, it was observed that using the Method of Moving Asymptotes (MMA) can be achieved feasible convergent solutions for a large amount of parameters combinations, in comparison, to the global convergent method of moving asymptotes (GCMMA) and optimality criteria. The cases of studies showed that the most robust filtering schemes were the sensitivity average and Helmholtz partial differential equation based filter, compared to the Heaviside projection. The choice of the initial guess demonstrated to be a determining factor in the final topologies obtained.},

The effects of manufacturing porosities, needling diameter and needling density on the thermal conductivity of the composite were determined through multiscale finite-element modelling. The degradation of thermal conductivity caused by the manufacturing porosity was higher in the longitudinal direction than in the through-thickness direction. Moreover, it was found that the through-thickness thermal conductivity of the composites increased with increasing needling diameter and density.},

ABSTRACT = {Electrochemical electrodes comprise multiple phenomena at different scales. Several works have tried to model such phenomena using statistical techniques. This paper proposes a novel process to work with reduced size images to reconstruct microstructures with the Simulated Annealing method. Later, using the Finite Volume Method, it is verified the effect of the image resolution on the effective transport coefficient (ETC). The method can be applied to synthetic images or images from the Scanning Electron Microscope. The first stage consists of obtaining the image of minimum size, which contains at least 98% of the statistical information of the original image, allowing an equivalent statistical study. The image size reduction was made by applying an iterative decimation over the image using the normalized coarseness to compare the amount of information contained at each step. Representative improvements, especially in processing time, are achieved by reducing the size of the reconstructed microstructures without affecting their statistical behavior. The process ends computing the conduction efficiency from the microstructures. The simulation results, obtained from two kinds of images from different materials, demonstrate the effectivity of the proposed approach. It is important to remark that the controlled decimation allows a reduction of the processor and memory use during the reconstruction and ETC computation of electrodes.},

ABSTRACT = {Interaction between dislocations and grain boundaries (GBs) in the forms of dislocation absorption, emission, and slip transmission at GBs significantly affects size-dependent plasticity in fine-grained polycrystals. Thus, it is vital to consider those GB mechanisms in continuum plasticity theories. In the present paper, a new GB model is proposed by considering slip transmission at GBs within the framework of gradient polycrystal plasticity. The GB model consists of the GB kinematic relations and governing equations for slip transmission, by which the influence of geometric factors including the misorientation between the incoming and outgoing slip systems and GB orientation, GB defects, and stress state at GBs are captured. The model is numerically implemented to study a benchmark problem of a bicrystal thin film under plane constrained shear. It is found that GB parameters, grain size, grain misorientation, and GB orientation significantly affect slip transmission and plastic behaviors in fine-grained polycrystals. Model prediction qualitatively agrees with experimental observations and results of discrete dislocation dynamics simulations.},

ABSTRACT = {The strengthening method of using hybrid fiber reinforced polymer is an effective way to increase the strengthening efficiency and lower the cost. This paper focuses on simulating the flexural behavior of reinforced concrete beam strengthened by prestressed C/GFRP (Carbon-Glass hybrid Fiber Reinforced Polymer) with different hybrid ratios and prestress levels. An elastoplastic damage constitution is used to simulate the mechanical behavior of concrete. A cohesive zone model under mixed mode is adopted to describe the debonding behavior of the FRP-concrete and concrete-steel interface. The results show good agreement with the experiment in the load-deflection curve, load-stress curve of steel, and HFRP. Furthermore, the failure mode of concrete and FRP debonding obtained from numerical simulation is the same as the test. Considering the improvement of the bending capacity, stiffness, and ductility of the strengthened beam in this paper, the best hybrid ratio of carbon to glass fiber is 1:1, and the suitable prestress level is between 30 and 50% of its ultimate strength.},

ABSTRACT = {An optically transparent metasurface (MS) is proposed to design a resonant cavity fed by a patch antenna operating at 5.6 GHz. In the proposed MS, a transparent micro metal mesh conductive (MMMC) film is used as the transparent conducting film (TCF), and it has a high optical transmittance of more than 75% and a low sheet resistance of 0.7 Ω/sq. The MS is composed of a layer of glass substrate and a layer of MMMC film. The unit cell of MS consists of a square patch using MMMC film patterned on a square glass substrate. The transparent MS, patch antenna, ground plane, and air-filled half-wavelength cavity form a resonant cavity antenna, to achieve an improved gain. The MS is designed, optimized and analyzed using the EM simulation software CST. Results show that the MS can improve the simulated boresight gain from 4.7 to 13.2 dBi by 8.5 dB, without affecting the impedance bandwidth (IMBW) much. The losses of MS with different values of sheet resistance are also studied, showing the MS using MMMC with sheet resistance of 0.7 Ω/sq has very small losses.},

ABSTRACT = {The main aim of this research is to present complete methodological guidelines for dynamic characterization of elastomers when subjected to strain rates of 100/s–10,000/s. We consider the following three aspects: (i) the design of high strain rate testing apparatus, (ii) finite element analysis for the optimization of the experimental setup, and (iii) experimental parameters and validation for the response of an elastomeric specimen. To test low impedance soft materials, design of a modified Kolsky bar is discussed. Based on this design, the testing apparatus was constructed, validated, and optimized numerically using finite element methods. Furthermore, investigations on traditional pulse shaping techniques and a new design for pulse shaper are described. The effect of specimen geometry on the homogeneous deformation has been thoroughly accounted for. Using the optimized specimen geometry and pulse shaping technique, nitrile butadiene rubber was tested at different strain rates, and the experimental findings were compared to numerical predictions.},

ABSTRACT = {Skid resistance is an important surface characteristic that influences roadway safety. Various studies have been performed to understand the interaction between pavement and tires through numerical simulation for skid resistance prediction. However, the friction parameters required for simulation inputs are generally determined by objective assumptions. This paper develops a finite element method (FEM)-based skid resistance simulation framework using in-situ 3D pavement surface texture and skid resistance data. A 3D areal pavement model is reconstructed from high resolution asphalt pavement surface texture data. The exponential decay friction model is implemented in the simulation and the interface friction parameters required for the simulation are determined using the binary search back-calculation approach based on a trial process with the desired level of differences between simulated and observed skid numbers. To understand the influence of texture characteristics on interface friction parameters, the high-resolution 3D texture data is separated into macro- and micro-scales through Butterworth filtering and various areal texture indicators are calculated at both levels. Principal component analysis (PCA) regression analysis is conducted to quantify the relationship between various texture characteristics and the interface friction parameters. The results from this study can be used to better prepare the inputs of friction parameters for FEM simulation.},

ABSTRACT = {The mechanical behavior of concrete under biaxial loading condition (especially biaxial compression) is one of the most important indexes to evaluate the quality of concrete. To study the mechanical behavior of concrete under biaxial compression at mesoscale, we adopted our recently developed 3D numerical model based on Voronoi tessellation and cohesive elements. A constitutive model considering the friction effect is used in the model to characterize the fracture behavior of all potential fracture surfaces inside the concrete. A series of numerical experiments with different biaxial compression stress ratios were carried out. It was found that with the increase of the biaxial compression ratio, the proportion of energy increment caused by friction stress increases. The effect of inner friction coefficient on the biaxial relative strength was also investigated, and this kind of study is hard to be carried out through laboratory experiments. The results show that the inner friction coefficient has a great influence on the biaxial relative strength of concrete, and there is a positive correlation between these two parameters. Based on the above rules, a conservative biaxial relative compression strength envelope is obtained by setting the inner friction coefficient as zero.},

ABSTRACT = {The new analysis of a simplified plane model of single-layered graphene is presented in this work as a potential material for reinforcement in ultralight and durable composites. However, owing to the clear literature discrepancies regarding the mechanical properties of graphene, it is extremely difficult to conduct any numerical analysis to design parts of machines and devices made of composites. Therefore, it is necessary to first systemize the analytical and finite element method (FEM) calculations, which will synergize mathematical models, used in the analysis of mechanical properties of graphene sheets, with the very nature of the chemical bond. For this reason, the considered model is a hexagonal mesh simulating the bonds between carbon atoms in graphene. The determination of mechanical properties of graphene was solved using the superposition method and finite element method. The calculation of the graphene tension was performed for two main directions of the graphene arrangement: armchair and zigzag. The computed results were verified and referred to articles and papers in the accessible literature. It was stated that in unloaded flake of graphene, the equilibrium of forces exists; however, owing to changes of inter-atom distance, the inner forces occur, which are responsible for the appearance of strains.},

ABSTRACT = {A new cross-channel extrusion (CCE) method with the application of a back pressure (BP) is proposed and experimentally tested. The introduction of pressure blocks the free flow of material by using an additional set of pistons, which prevents the loss of consistency. The paper presents results of experimental trials of CCE process. Between one and eight passes of CCE with and without a BP were applied to pure copper billets to refine their initial coarse-grained microstructure at room temperature. It was found that processing by CCE results in the formation of a lamellar structure along the extruded axis and the fine-grained structure in the remaining volume. The material exhibited dynamic recrystallization, which results in the formation of 0.5- to 2-μm grains after one pass and 2- to 8-μm grains after four CCE passes. The fine-grained material had YS of 390-415 MPa. An increase in the microhardness from 70 to 130 HV02 after one pass and then a decrease after four passes were observed. This might indicate that secondary recrystallization and selective grain growth occur, because an exothermic peak (158.5 °C, 53 ± 2.1 J/mol) was observed during DSC (differential scanning calorimetry) testing. The resistivity of the once deformed copper significantly decreases, while its further processing causes the resistivity to increase.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper presents a new method of modeling the influence of mechanical stresses on a magnetic permeability tensor of soft magnetic materials. The proposed method utilizes the principal stresses concept to compensate the influence of shear stresses. As a result, the stress dependence of a magnetic permeability tensor may be assessed with only the knowledge about the influence of axial stresses on magnetic properties of isotropic material. The proposed method was used for a finite element method based model of a tensductor designed for measurements of tensile forces. Due to the fact that 2D stresses distribution occurs in a tensductor, simplification of both principal stresses and a magnetic permeability tensor rotation procedure was proposed. As a result, good agreement was reached between the results of modeling and the results of experimental tests. This result validates the possibility of utilization of the proposed modeling method for the design of magnetomechanical devices.},

ABSTRACT = {Ceria is one of the most important functional rare-earth oxides with wide industrial applications. Its amazing oxygen storage/release capacity is attributed to cerium’s flexible valence conversion between 4+ and 3+. However, there still exists some debate on whether the valence conversion is due to the Ce-4f electron localization-delocalization transition or the character of Ce–O covalent bonds. In this work, a mixed valence model was established and the formation energies of oxygen vacancies and electronic charges were obtained by density functional theory calculations. Our results show that the formation energy of oxygen vacancy is affected by the valence state of its neighboring Ce atom and two oxygen vacancies around a Ce4+ in CeO2 have a similar effect to a Ce3+. The electronic charge difference between Ce3+ and Ce4+ is only about 0.4e. Therefore, we argue that the valence conversion should be understood according to the adjustment of the ratio of covalent bond to ionic bond. We propose that the formation energy of oxygen vacancy be used as a descriptor to determine the valence state of Ce in cerium oxides.},

ABSTRACT = {Carbon Fiber-reinforced plastics (CFRPs) are widely used in the aerospace industry due to their highly mechanical properties and low density. Most of these materials are used in high-risk structures, where the damage caused by machining must be controlled and minimized. The optimization of these processes is still a challenge in the industry. In this work, a special cutting device, which allows for orthogonal cutting tests, with a linear displacement at a wide range of constant cutting speeds, has been developed by the authors. This paper describes the developed cutting device and its application to analyze the influence of tool geometry and cutting parameters on the material damage caused by the orthogonal cutting of a thick multidirectional CFRP laminate. The results show that a more robust geometry (higher cutting edge radius and lower rake angle) and higher feed cause an increase in the thrust force of a cutting tool, causing burrs and delamination damage. By reducing the cutting speed, the components with a higher machining force were also observed to have less surface integrity control.},

ABSTRACT = {In this study, the influence of the addition of rare earth oxides on the phase composition and density of KNN piezoelectric ceramics was investigated. The initial powders of Na2CO3 and K2CO3 were dried at 150 °C for 2 h. Then, a powder mixture for synthesis was prepared by adding a stoichiometric amount of Nb2O5 and 5 and 10 wt % overabundance of Na2CO3. All powders were mixed by ball-milling for 24 h and synthesized at 950 °C. The phase composition of the reaction bed was checked by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD). It had an appearance of tetragonal and monoclinic K0.5Na0.5NbO3 (KNN) phases. Then, 1 and 2 wt % of Er2O3 and Yb2O3, were added to the mixture. Green samples of 25 mm diameter and 3 mm thickness were prepared and sintered by hot pressing at 1000 °C for 2 h under 25 MPa pressure. The final samples were investigated via scanning electron microscopy (SEM)-energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), XRD, Rietveld, and ultrasonic methods. Phase analysis showed tetragonal and orthorhombic KNN phases, and a contamination of (K2CO3·1.5H2O) was present. The obtained KNN polycrystals had a relative density above 95%. Texturing of the material was confirmed as a result of hot pressing.},

ABSTRACT = {The present work is aimed to investigate the capability of the discrete element method (DEM) to model properly wave propagation in solid materials, with special focus on the determination of elastic properties through wave velocities. Reference micro–macro relationships for elastic constitutive parameters have been based on the kinematic hypothesis as well as obtained numerically by simulation of a quasistatic uniaxial compression test. The validity of these relationships in the dynamic analysis of the wave propagation has been checked. Propagation of the longitudinal and shear wave pulse in rectangular sample discretized with discs has been analysed. Wave propagation velocities obtained in the analysis have been used to determine elastic properties. Elastic properties obtained in the dynamic analysis have been compared with those determined by simulation of the quasistatic compression test.},

ABSTRACT = {The determination of elastic modulus (E) and hardness (H) relies on the accuracy of the contact area under the indenter tip, but this parameter cannot be explicitly measured during the nanoindentation process. This work presents a new approach that can derive the elastic modulus (E) and contact depth (hc) based on measured experiment stiffness using the continuous-stiffness-measurement (CSM) method. To achieve this, an inverse algorithm is proposed by incorporating a set of stiffness-based relationship functions that are derived from combining the dimensional analysis approach and computational simulation. This proposed solution considers both the sink-in and pile-up contact profiles; therefore, it provides a more accurate solution when compared to a conventional method that only considers the sink-in contact profile. While the proposed solution is sensitive to Poisson’s ratio (ν) and the equivalent indentation conical angle (θ), it is not affected by material plasticity, including yield strength (σy) and work hardening (n) for the investigated range of 0.001 < σy/E < 0.5. The proposed stiffness-based approach can be used to consistently derive elastic modulus and hardness by using stiffness and the load-and-unload curve measured by the continuous-stiffness-measurement (CSM) method.},

ABSTRACT = {The interaction between interstitial oxygen atoms and <a>-type screw dislocations was investigated via first-principles calculations to elucidate the effect of oxygen solutes on the deformation behaviors of Mg. The results show that repulsive interactions exist between basal screw dislocation cores and oxygen atoms, which would enable the full basal dislocation to bypass the oxygen atoms in the dislocation glide plane through the cross-slip process. This repulsion also increases the resistance to the motion of dissociated basal dislocations. Moreover, the energy of prismatic <a>-type screw dislocation cores is reduced by the presence of oxygen, which would stabilize the screw dislocation core on the prismatic plane, accordingly facilitating the prismatic slip. This information can complement the fundamental knowledge of alloying Mg using interstitial solutes.},

ABSTRACT = {A novel approach to take into account the effect of compaction pressure on the shape of modeled hysteresis curves of self-developed soft magnetic composite cores is presented. The description relies on the introduction of an additional term in the so-called effective field, which is assumed proportional to the compaction pressure. The proposed model bears some resemblance to the Sablik’s extension of the Jiles–Atherton model, readily used in the studies of the magnetoelastic effect. Verification of the description is carried out using measurement data from self-developed iron-based composite cores.},

ABSTRACT = {The strengthening energy or embrittling potency of an alloying element is a fundamental energetics of the grain boundary (GB) embrittlement that control the mechanical properties of metallic materials. A data-driven machine learning approach has recently been used to develop prediction models to uncover the physical mechanisms and design novel materials with enhanced properties. In this work, to accurately predict and uncover the key features in determining the strengthening energies, three machine learning methods were used to model and predict strengthening energies of solutes in different metallic GBs. In addition, 142 strengthening energies from previous density functional theory calculations served as our dataset to train three machine learning models: support vector machine (SVM) with linear kernel, SVM with radial basis function (RBF) kernel, and artificial neural network (ANN). Considering both the bond-breaking effect and atomic size effect, the nonlinear kernel based SVR model was found to perform the best with a correlation of r2 ~ 0.889. The size effect feature shows a significant improvement to prediction performance with respect to using bond-breaking effect only. Moreover, the mean impact value analysis was conducted to quantitatively explore the relative significance of each input feature for improving the effective prediction.},

ABSTRACT = {This investigation presents the results of research on low cycle fatigue properties of Sc-modified AA2519-T62 extrusion. The basic mechanical properties of the investigated alloy have been established in the tensile test. The low cycle fatigue testing has been performed on five different levels of total strain amplitude: 0.4%; 0.5%; 0.6%; 0.7% and 0.8% with cycle asymmetry coefficient R = 0.1. For each level of total strain amplitude, the graphs of variations in stress amplitude and plastic strain amplitude in the number of cycles have been presented. The obtained results allowed to establish Ramberg-Osgood and Manson-Coffin-Basquin relationships. The established values of the cyclic strength coefficient and cyclic strain hardening exponent equal to k’ = 1518.1 MPa and n’ = 0.1702. Based on the Manscon-Coffin-Basquin equation, the values of the following parameters have been established: the fatigue strength coefficient σ’f = 1489.8 MPa, the fatigue strength exponent b = −0.157, the fatigue ductility coefficient ε’f = 0.4931 and the fatigue ductility exponent c = −1.01. The fatigue surfaces of samples tested on 0.4%, 0.6% and 0.8% of total strain amplitude have been subjected to scanning electron microscopy observations. The scanning electron microscopy observations of the fatigue surfaces revealed the presence of cracks in striations in the surrounding area with a high concentration of precipitates. It has been observed that larger Al2Cu precipitates exhibit a higher tendency to fracture than smaller precipitates having a higher concentration of scandium and zirconium.},

ABSTRACT = {The purpose of this work is to simulate the powder compaction of refractory materials, using the discrete element method (DEM). The capability of two cohesive contact models, implemented in different DEM packages, to simulate the compaction of a mixture of two refractory materials (dead burnt magnesia (MgO) and calcined alumina (Al2O3)) was analyzed, and the simulation results were compared with experimental data. The maximum force applied by the punch and the porosity and final shape quality of the compact were examined. As a starting point, the influence of Young’s modulus (E), the cohesion energy density (CED), and the diameter of the Al2O3 particles (D) on the results was analyzed. This analysis allowed to distinguish that E and CED were the most influential factors. Therefore, a more extensive examination of these two factors was performed afterward, using a fixed value of D. The analysis of the combined effect of these factors made it possible to calibrate the DEM models, and consequently, after this calibration, the compacts had an adequate final shape quality and the maximum force applied in the simulations matched with the experimental one. However, the porosity of the simulated compacts was higher than that of the real ones. To reduce the porosity of the compacts, lower values of D were also modeled. Consequently, the relative deviation of the porosity was reduced from 40–50% to 20%, using a value of D equal to 0.15 mm.},

ABSTRACT = {Steel corrosion is considered as the main factor for the insufficient durability of concrete structures, especially in the marine environment. In this paper, to further inhibit steel corrosion in a high chloride environment and take advantage of the dual-functional carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP), the impressed current cathodic protection (ICCP) technique was applied to the hybrid-reinforced concrete beam with internally embedded CFRP bars and steel fiber reinforced polymer composite bar (SFCB) as the anode material while the steel bar was compelled to the cathode. The effect of the new ICCP system on the flexural performance of the hybrid-reinforced concrete beam subjected to corrosion was verified experimentally. First, the electricity-accelerated precorrosion test was performed for the steel bar in the hybrid-reinforced beams with a target corrosion ratio of 5%. Then, the dry–wet cycles corrosion was conducted and the ICCP system was activated simultaneously for the hybrid-reinforced concrete beam for 180 days. Finally, the three-point bending experiment was carried out for the hybrid-reinforced concrete beams. The steel bars were taken out from the concrete to quantitatively measure the corrosion ratio after flexural tests. Results showed that the further corrosion of steel bars could be inhibited effectively by the ICCP treatment with the CFRP bar and the SFCB as the anode. Additionally, the ICCP system showed an obvious effect on the flexural behavior of the hybrid-reinforced concrete beams: The crack load and ultimate load, as well as the stiffness, were enhanced notably compared with the beam without ICCP treatment. Compared with the SFCB anode, the ICCP system with the CFRP bar as the anode material was more effective for the hybrid-reinforced concrete beam to prevent the steel corrosion.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, the main objectives are to investigate and select the most suitable parameters used in particle swarm optimization (PSO), namely the number of rules (nrule), population size (npop), initial weight (wini), personal learning coefficient (c1), global learning coefficient (c2), and velocity limits (fv), in order to improve the performance of the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system in determining the buckling capacity of circular opening steel beams. This is an important mechanical property in terms of the safety of structures under subjected loads. An available database of 3645 data samples was used for generation of training (70%) and testing (30%) datasets. Monte Carlo simulations, which are natural variability generators, were used in the training phase of the algorithm. Various statistical measurements, such as root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), Willmott’s index of agreement (IA), and Pearson’s coefficient of correlation (R), were used to evaluate the performance of the models. The results of the study show that the performance of ANFIS optimized by PSO (ANFIS-PSO) is suitable for determining the buckling capacity of circular opening steel beams, but is very sensitive under different PSO investigation and selection parameters. The findings of this study show that nrule = 10, npop = 50, wini = 0.1 to 0.4, c1 = [1, 1.4], c2 = [1.8, 2], fv = 0.1, which are the most suitable selection values to ensure the best performance for ANFIS-PSO. In short, this study might help in selection of suitable PSO parameters for optimization of the ANFIS model.},

ABSTRACT = {The interplay of interface and bulk dislocation nucleation and glide in determining the motion of twin boundaries, slip-twin interaction, and the mechanical (i.e., stress-strain) behavior of fcc metals is investigated in the current work with the help of molecular dynamics simulations. To this end, simulation cells containing twin boundaries are subject to loading in different directions relative to the twin boundary orientation. In particular, shear loading of the twin boundary results in significantly different behavior than in the other loading cases, and in particular to jerky stress flow. For example, twin boundary shear loading along 〈 112 〉 results in translational normal twin boundary motion, twinning or detwinning, and net hardening. On the other hand, such loading along 〈 110 〉 results in oscillatory normal twin boundary motion and no hardening. As shown here, this difference results from the different effect each type of loading has on lattice stacking order perpendicular to the twin boundary, and so on interface partial dislocation nucleation. In both cases, however, the observed stress fluctuation and “jerky flow” is due to fast partial dislocation nucleation and glide on the twin boundary. This is supported by the determination of the velocity and energy barriers to glide for twin boundary partials. In particular, twin boundary partial edge dislocations are significantly faster than corresponding screws as well as their bulk counterparts. In the last part of the work, the effect of variable twin boundary orientation in relation to the loading direction is investigated. In particular, a change away from pure normal loading to the twin plane toward mixed shear-normal loading results in a transition of dominant deformation mechanism from bulk dislocation nucleation/slip, to twin boundary motion.},
