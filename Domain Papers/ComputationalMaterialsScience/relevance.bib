ABSTRACT = {A microstructure finite element method combining the cohesive zone model (CZM) is used to simulate the mechanical behavior, deformation, and failure of polymer-bonded explosive (PBX) 9501 under quasi-static loading. PBX 9501 consists of Cyclotetramethylene tetranitramine (HMX) filler particles with a random distribution packaged in a polymeric binder. The particle is treated as elastic and the binder as viscoelastic. Cohesive elements with a bilinear softening law are inserted into the particle/binder interface, the HMX particle, and the binder to study the interface’s debonding and failure evolution. Macroscopic stress–strain curves homogenized across the microstructure under tension and compression with different strain rates are basically consistent with the experimental data. The interface debonding approximately vertical to the loading direction is the primary failure mechanism under tension, while shear failure along the interfaces and particle fracture plays a significant role under compression. The effects of interface strengths and strain rates on the performance of PBX 9501 are also evaluated. The tensile and compressive strengths are dependent on the interface strength and strain rate, but the failure paths are insensitive. This model is shown to accurately predict macroscopic responses and improve our understanding of the relationship between the mechanical behavior and microstructure of PBX 9501.},

ABSTRACT = {Purpose: To analyze in vitro the mechanical behavior of five types of complete coverage crowns fabricated from different materials. Materials and methods: Seventy-five full coverage crowns were divided into five groups according to material: Group I, metal core with feldspathic ceramic covering (MC- control group); Group II, zirconia core with feldspathic ceramic covering (CZ); Group III, tetragonal monolithic zirconia (TMZ); Group IV, cubic monolithic zirconia (CMZ); Group V, high molecular weight polymethyl methacrylate (PMMAG) doped with graphene nanoparticles. All crowns underwent in vitro fatiguing by dynamic loading in wet conditions to simulate the masticatory forces to which prosthodontic materials are subject in the oral medium. Lastly, fracture resistance was evaluated by static compression testing. Results: The fracture resistance values obtained were as follows: Group MC, 2443.6 ± 238.6 N; Group CZ, 2095.4 ± 329.2 N; Group TMZ, 2494.6 ± 236.6 N; Group CMZ, 1523.6 ± 325.2 N; and Group PMMAG, 1708.9 ± 386.6 N. Group MC presented higher strength with statistically significant differences in comparison with Groups CZ (P = 0.002), CMZ (P < 0.001), and PMMAG (P < 0.001). Weibull distribution showed less probability of cumulative biomechanical failure in Groups MC and TMZ. Conclusions: Metal-ceramic and tetragonal zirconia showed high fracture resistance, while cubic zirconia and PMMA doped with graphene nanoparticles obtained lower values.},

ABSTRACT = {Compressive strength is considered as one of the most important parameters in concrete design. Time and cost can be reduced if the compressive strength of concrete is accurately estimated. In this paper, a new prediction model for compressive strength of high-performance concrete (HPC) was developed using a non-tuned machine learning technique, namely, a regularized extreme learning machine (RELM). The RELM prediction model was developed using a comprehensive dataset obtained from previously published studies. The input variables of the model include cement, blast furnace slag, fly ash, water, superplasticizer, coarse aggregate, fine aggregate, and age of specimens. k-fold cross-validation was used to assess the prediction reliability of the developed RELM model. The prediction results of the RELM model were evaluated using various error measures and compared with that of the standard extreme learning machine (ELM) and other methods presented in the literature. The findings of this research indicate that the compressive strength of HPC can be accurately estimated using the proposed RELM model.},

ABSTRACT = {Flame retardant cables were investigated using thermo-gravimetric analysis to measure the reference temperature and reference rate required for a fire spread simulation using a Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS). Sensitivity analysis was also performed to understand the effects of the reference temperature and rate on the pyrolysis reactions. A two-step pyrolysis reaction was typically observed regardless of the cable type, and each pyrolysis reaction could be attributed to single or multiple components depending on the cable type and reaction order. Although the structures, compositions, and insulation performances of the cables differed considerably, the reference temperatures of the two-step pyrolysis reaction were extremely similar regardless of the cable type. Conversely, the reference rates of the different types of cables varied significantly. The sensitivity analysis results indicate that the mean values of the reference temperature and rate are sufficient to simulate the pyrolysis reactions of flame retardant cables. The results obtained herein also suggest that the heat transfer and pyrolysis reaction path associated with the multi-layered cable structure may be more important for accurately determining the ignition and fire spread characteristics, which are attributable to differences in cable structure, composition, and insulation performance.},

ABSTRACT = {It is well known that the performance of thermoelectric measured by figure of merit ZT linearly depends on electrical conductivity, while it is quadratic related to the Seebeck coefficient, and the improvement of Seebeck coefficient may reduce electrical conductivity. As a promising thermoelectric material, BiCuOCh (Ch = Se, S) possesses intrinsically low thermal conductivity, and comparing with its p-type counterpart, n-type BiCuOCh has superior electrical conductivity. Thus, a strategy for increasing Seebeck coefficient while almost maintaining electrical conductivity for enhancing thermoelectric properties of n-type BiCuOCh is highly desired. In this work, the effects of uniaxial tensile strain on the electronic structures and thermoelectric properties of n-type BiCuOCh are examined by using first-principles calculations combined with semiclassical Boltzmann transport theory. The results indicate that the Seebeck coefficient can be enhanced under uniaxial tensile strain, and the reduction of electrical conductivity is negligible. The enhancement is attributed to the increase in the slope of total density of states and the effective mass of electron, accompanied with the conduction band near Fermi level flatter along the Γ to Z direction under strain. Comparing with the unstrained counterpart, the power factor can be improved by 54% for n-type BiCuOSe, and 74% for n-type BiCuOS under a strain of 6% at 800 K with electron concentration 3 × 1020 cm−3. Furthermore, the optimal carrier concentrations at different strains are determined. These insights point to an alternative strategy for superior thermoelectric properties.},

ABSTRACT = {The intent of this work is to numerically investigate the effect of second phase morphology on damage evolution characteristics of dual-phase (DP) steels. A strain gradient enhanced crystal plasticity framework is used in order to capture the deformation heterogeneity caused by lattice orientations and microstructural size effects. The investigation is focused on two different martensite distributions (banded and random) that are relevant for industrial applications. The effects of martensite morphology are compared by artificially generated 2D plane strain microstructures with initial void content. The Representative volume elements (RVEs) are subjected to tensile deformation imposed by periodic boundary conditions. Evolution of voids are analyzed individually as well as a whole and characterized with respect to average axial strain. It is found that during stretching voids exhibit varying evolution characteristics due to generation of inhomogeneous strain fields within the structure. The behavior of individual voids shows that the stress-state surrounding the void is different from the imposed far field macroscopic stress-state. The voids at the ferrite martensite interface and in ferrite grains of the randomly distributed martensite grow more than in the banded structure. On the other hand, voids formed by martensite cracking growth shows an opposite trend.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, a methodology for conducting a computer simulation of the frictional heating process of a multi-disc braking system is proposed. The single braking of a system of three identical discs made of carbon–carbon (C/C) carbon frictional composite material (CFCM) is considered. In order to determine the operational characteristics of the brake, a heat dynamics of friction (HDF) system of equations is formulated, which takes into account the contact pressure rise time, thermal sensitivity of the C/C material, the change in the coefficient of friction during braking, the parameters of the friction surface’s microgeometry and the mutual influence of sliding velocity and temperature. A numerical solution using the finite element method (FEM) of the HDF system of equations allows us to determine changes in key braking process characteristics, such as work done, braking torque, friction coefficient, heat transfer coefficient, velocity and temperature. Finally, a comparative analysis of the results obtained for three different time profiles of the coefficient of friction is carried out.},

ABSTRACT = {In this study, a novel approach for generating Representative Volume Elements (RVEs) is introduced. In contrast to common generators, the new RVE generator is based on discrete methods to reconstruct synthetic microstructures, using simple methods and a modular structure. The plain and uncomplicated structure of the generator makes the extension with new features quite simple. It is discussed why certain features are essential for microstructural simulations. The discrete methods are implemented into a python tool. A Random Sequential Addition (RSA)-Algorithm for discrete volumes is developed and the tessellation is realized with a discrete tessellation function. The results show that the generator can successfully reconstruct realistic microstructures with elongated grains and martensite bands from given input data sets.},

ABSTRACT = {In this work, a Preisach-recurrent neural network model is proposed to predict the dynamic hysteresis in ARMCO pure iron, an important soft magnetic material in particle accelerator magnets. A recurrent neural network coupled with Preisach play operators is proposed, along with a novel validation method for the identification of the model’s parameters. The proposed model is found to predict the magnetic flux density of ARMCO pure iron with a Normalised Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE) better than 0.7%, when trained with just six different hysteresis loops. The model is evaluated using ramp-rates not used in the training procedure, which shows the ability of the model to predict data which has not been measured. The results demonstrate that the Preisach model based on a recurrent neural network can accurately describe ferromagnetic dynamic hysteresis when trained with a limited amount of data, showing the model’s potential in the field of materials science.},

ABSTRACT = {The cell membrane is a complex system that consists of lipids, proteins, polysaccharides, and amphiphilic phospholipids. It plays an important role in ADME processes that are responsible for the final pharmaceutical effects of xenobiotics (bioavailability, activity). To study drug-membrane interaction at the molecular level, several high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) membrane model systems have been proposed which are mimicking mainly its lipid character. The aim of this work was to study interactions of new synthesized antiepileptic compounds of 4-alkyl-5-(3-chlorophenyl)-2,4-dihydro-3H-1,2,4-triazole-3-thione derivatives with Chirobiotic column containing glycoprotein ligand attached to the silica matrix. The affinity of the analytes to immobilized glycoprotein ligand was examined chromatographically in reversed-phase mode. The thermodynamics of interactions between bioactive compounds and teicoplanin was studied in terms of the van’t Hoff linear relationship ln k vs. 1/T in the range of 5–45 °C. Change in enthalpy (ΔH°), change in entropy (ΔS°) and change in Gibbs free energy (ΔG°) were estimated utilizing graphical extrapolation and interpolation methods. The density functional theory (DFT) approach and docking simulations were used to get the molecular interpretation and prove the obtained experimental results. Cross-correlations of chromatographic and thermodynamic parameters with non-empirical topological and quantum chemical indices suggest that the polarizability of analytes appears to be responsible for the interactions of the tested molecules with teicoplanin and, ultimately, their retention on the column. Experimental and theoretical parameters were subjected to statistical analysis using regression models. Partial least squares (PLS) regression model showed the usefulness of the experimentally measured parameter φ0 (MeOH) to discriminate between anticonvulsant active and inactive 1,2,4-triazole-3-thione derivatives. Obtained results point out the usefulness of interaction of potential anticonvulsants with glycoprotein class of compounds to anticipate their activity.},

ABSTRACT = {The welding of cemented carbide to tool steel is a challenging task, of scientific and industrial relevance, as it combines the high level of hardness of cemented carbide with the high level of fracture toughness of steel, while reducing the shaping cost and extending the application versatility, as its tribological, toughness, thermal and chemical properties can be optimally harmonised. The already existing joining technologies often impart either insufficient toughness or poor high-temperature strength to a joint to withstand the ever-increasing severe service condition demands. In this paper, a novel capacitor discharge welding (CDW) process is investigated for the case of a butt-joint between a tungsten carbide-cobalt (WC-Co) composite rod and an AISI M35 high-speed steel (HSS) rod. The latter was shaped with a conical-ended projection to promote a high current concentration and heat at the welding zone. CDW functions by combining a direct current (DC) electric current pulse and external uniaxial pressure after a preloading step, in which only uniaxial pressure is applied. The relatively high heating and cooling rates promote a thin layer of a characteristic ultrafine microstructure that combines high strength and toughness. Morphological analysis showed that the CDW process: (a) forms a sound and net shaped joint, (b) preserves the sub-micrometric grain structure of the original WC-Co composite base materials, via a transitional layer, (c) refines the microstructure of the original martensite of the HSS base material, and (d) results in an improved corrosion resistance across a 1-mm thick layer near the weld interface on the steel side. A nano-indentation test survey determined: (e) no hardness deterioration on the HSS side of the weld zone, although (f) a slight decrease in hardness was observed across the transitional layer on the composite side. Furthermore, (g) an indication of toughness of the joint was perceived as the size of the crack induced by processing the residual stress after sample preparation was unaltered.},

ABSTRACT = {The rapid growth of Additive Manufacturing (AM) in the past decade has demonstrated a significant potential in cost-effective production with a superior quality product. A numerical simulation is a steep way to learn and improve the product quality, life cycle, and production cost. To cope with the growing AM field, researchers are exploring different techniques, methods, models to simulate the AM process efficiently. The goal is to develop a thermo-mechanical weld model for the Directed Energy Deposition (DED) process for 316L stainless steel at an efficient computational cost targeting to model large AM parts in residual stress calculation. To adapt the weld model to the DED simulation, single and multi-track thermal simulations were carried out. Numerical results were validated by the DED experiment. A good agreement was found between predicted temperature trends for numerical simulation and experimental results. A large number of weld tracks in the 3D solid AM parts make the finite element process simulation challenging in terms of computational time and large amounts of data management. The method of activating elements layer by layer and introducing heat in a cyclic manner called a thermal cycle heat input was applied. Thermal cycle heat input reduces the computational time considerably. The numerical results were compared to the experimental data for thermal and residual stress analyses. A lumping of layers strategy was implemented to reduce further computational time. The different number of lumping layers was analyzed to define the limit of lumping to retain accuracy in the residual stress calculation. The lumped layers residual stress calculation was validated by the contour cut method in the deposited sample. Thermal behavior and residual stress prediction for the different numbers of a lumped layer were examined and reported computational time reduction.},

ABSTRACT = {The electrification of automotive powertrains in recent years has been driving the development of internal combustion engines towards reduced volumes with higher power outputs. These changes place extreme demands on engine materials. Engineers employ the computer-aided engineering approach to design reliable and cost-effective engines. However, this approach relies on accurate knowledge of the material deformation and fatigue characteristics during service-like loading. The present study seeks to investigate the effect of dwell times on the deformation and fatigue behaviour of the A356-T7 + 0.5 wt.% Cu alloy used to cast cylinder heads. In particular, we study the effect of dwell time duration at various temperatures. A combined fatigue-dwell testing procedure, with the dwell at the maximum compressive strain, replicates the service conditions. It is found that the material exhibits a stress relaxation behaviour with a decreasing relaxation rate. At lower temperatures, the load level influences the relaxation more than at elevated temperatures. However, the dwell does not significantly affect the hardening behaviour or the life of the tested alloy. Finally, we model the time-dependent material behaviour numerically. The Chaboche model, combined with a Cowper–Symonds power-law, is found to capture the visco-plastic deformation behaviour accurately.},

ABSTRACT = {The aim of this work is to efficiently and robustly solve the statistical inverse problem related to the identification of the elastic properties at both macroscopic and mesoscopic scales of heterogeneous anisotropic materials with a complex microstructure that usually cannot be properly described in terms of their mechanical constituents at microscale. Within the context of linear elasticity theory, the apparent elasticity tensor field at a given mesoscale is modeled by a prior non-Gaussian tensor-valued random field. A general methodology using multiscale displacement field measurements simultaneously made at both macroscale and mesoscale has been recently proposed for the identification the hyperparameters of such a prior stochastic model by solving a multiscale statistical inverse problem using a stochastic computational model and some information from displacement fields at both macroscale and mesoscale. This paper contributes to the improvement of the computational efficiency, accuracy and robustness of such a method by introducing (i) a mesoscopic numerical indicator related to the spatial correlation length(s) of kinematic fields, allowing the time-consuming global optimization algorithm (genetic algorithm) used in a previous work to be replaced with a more efficient algorithm and (ii) an ad hoc stochastic representation of the hyperparameters involved in the prior stochastic model in order to enhance both the robustness and the precision of the statistical inverse identification method. Finally, the proposed improved method is first validated on in silico materials within the framework of 2D plane stress and 3D linear elasticity (using multiscale simulated data obtained through numerical computations) and then exemplified on a real heterogeneous biological material (beef cortical bone) within the framework of 2D plane stress linear elasticity (using multiscale experimental data obtained through mechanical testing monitored by digital image correlation).},

ABSTRACT = {The effect of Nb content on microstructure, mechanical properties and superelasticity was investigated for a series of Ti-xNb alloys, fabricated by the laser engineered net shaping method, using elemental Ti and Nb powders. The microstructure of as-deposited materials consisted of columnar β-phase grains, elongated in the built direction. However, due to the presence of undissolved Nb particles during the deposition process, an additional heat treatment was necessary. The observed changes in mechanical properties were explained in relation to the phase constituents and deformation mechanisms. Due to the elevated oxygen content in the investigated materials (2 at.%), the specific deformation mechanisms were observed at lower Nb content in comparison to the conventionally fabricated materials. This made it possible to conclude that oxygen increases the stability of the β phase in β–Ti alloys. For the first time, superelasticity was observed in Ti–Nb-based alloys fabricated by the additive manufacturing method. The highest recoverable strain of 3% was observed in Ti–19Nb alloy as a result of high elasticity and reverse martensitic transformation stress-induced during the loading.},

ABSTRACT = {Achieving a good match between strength and conductivity is a challenge of the development of the high-performance Cu-Cr-Nb alloy for aerospace and fusion energy. The effect of heat treatment on Cr2Nb phase, strength and conductivity of spark plasma sintered (SPSed) Cu-2Cr-1Nb (at%) alloy was investigated. The results illustrated that Cr2Nb phase of Cu-2Cr-1Nb alloy can be regulated by heat treatment, multi-scale Cr2Nb phase with sizes of 0.10–0.50 μm, 30–100 nm and less than 30 nm was obtained, and the strength and conductivity were significantly increased after heat treatment at 500 °C for 2 h, the room temperature tensile strength and conductivity were 332 MPa and 86.7% IACS, 2.5% and 34.8% higher than those of as-SPSed alloy; the tensile strength at 700 °C was 76 MPa. Increasing heat treatment temperature and time, the tensile strength of the alloy was reduced by 1.5%, 4.3% and 12.3% after heat treatment at 500 °C, 700 °C and 950 °C for 72 h. The good match between strength and conductivity of Cu-Cr-Nb alloy was obtained by reducing the content of alloying elements (Cr and Nb) and microstructure regulation. This approach can be used to prepare structural/functional materials with excellent strength and conductivity.},

ABSTRACT = {At the stage of designing a special machine tool, it is necessary to analyze many variants of structural solutions of frames and load-bearing systems and to choose the best solution in terms of dynamic properties, in particular considering its resistance to chatter. For this reason, it is preferred to adopt a low-dimensional calculation model, which allows the user to reduce the necessary calculation time while maintaining a high accuracy. The paper presents the methodology of modeling the natural frequencies, mode shapes, and receptance functions of machine tool steel welded frames filled with strongly heterogenous polymer concrete, using low-dimensional models developed by the rigid finite elements method (RigFEM). In the presented study, a RigFEM model of a simple steel beam filled with polymer concrete and a frame composed of such beams were built. Then, the dynamic properties obtained on the basis of the developed RigFEM models were compared with the experimental results and the 1D and 3D finite element models (FEM) in terms of accuracy and dimensionality. As a result of the experimental verification, the full structural compliance of the RigFEM models (for beam and frame) was obtained, which was manifested by the agreement of the mode shapes. Additionally, experimental verification showed a high accuracy of the RigFEM models, obtaining for the beam model a relative error for natural frequencies of less than 4% and on average 2.2%, and for the frame model at a level not exceeding 11% and on average 5.5%. Comparing the RigFEM and FEM models, it was found that the RigFEM models have a slightly worse accuracy, with a dimensionality significantly reduced by 95% for the beam and 99.8% for the frame.},

ABSTRACT = {In the machine, metallurgical, and shipbuilding industries, steel products with alloy and composite coatings based on nickel may be used. It is expedient to improve the physicochemical properties of the surface layer of products as they have a significant roughness value after thermal spraying. It is therefore important to finish the layers applied by flame spraying, where machining is used for this purpose. However, it causes a loss of coating material, which is quite expensive. Therefore, in order to reduce costs and improve the quality of the surface layer, the finishing treatment of nickel-based coatings by means of plastic working is used. Two types of plastic working were proposed: rolling and burnishing. Numerical and experimental tests of the plastic processing of alloy coatings were carried out. The roughness of the coatings after rolling decreased to 1/25 and 30% strengthening of the alloy coating matrix was determined. After burnishing, roughness was reduced to 1/12 and the alloy coatings were strengthened by 25%. Plastic working by rolling and burnishing has a beneficial effect on the surface quality of the workpiece, not only by significantly improving the roughness, but also by increasing the strength properties of the surface layers.},

ABSTRACT = {The structural, mechanical, and electronic properties, as well as stability, elastic anisotropy and effective mass of AlN/GaN/InN in the Pmn21 phase were determined using density functional theory (DFT). The phonon dispersion spectra and elastic constants certify the dynamic and mechanical stability at ambient pressure, and the relative enthalpies were lower than those of most proposed III-nitride polymorphs. The mechanical properties reveal that Pmn21-AlN and Pmn21-GaN possess a high Vickers hardness of 16.3 GPa and 12.8 GPa. Pmn21-AlN, Pmn21-GaN and Pmn21-InN are all direct semiconductor materials within the HSE06 hybrid functional, and their calculated energy band gaps are 5.17 eV, 2.77 eV and 0.47 eV, respectively. The calculated direct energy band gaps and mechanical properties of AlN/GaN/InN in the Pmn21 phase reveal that these three polymorphs may possess great potential for industrial applications in the future.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper presents research on the impact of fly ash addition on selected physical and mechanical parameters of concrete made with slag cement. Experimental tests were carried out to measure the migration of chloride ions in concrete, the tightness of concrete exposed to water under pressure, and the compressive strength and tensile strength of concrete during splitting. Six series of concrete mixes made with CEM IIIA 42.5 and 32.5 cement were tested. The base concrete mix was modified by adding fly ash as a partial cement substitute in the amounts of 25% and 33%. A comparative analysis of the obtained results indicates a significant improvement in tightness, especially in concrete based on CEM IIIA 32.5 cement and resistance to chloride ion penetration for the concretes containing fly ash additive. In the concretes containing fly ash additive, a slower rate of initial strength increase and high strength over a long period of maturation are shown. In accordance with the presented research results, it is suggested that changes to the European standardization system be considered, to allow the use of fly ash additive in concrete made with CEM IIIA 42.5 or 32.5 cement classes. Such a solution is not currently acceptable in standards in some European Countries.},

ABSTRACT = {The digitization of materials is the prerequisite for accelerating product development. However, technologically, this is only beneficial when reliability is maintained. This requires comprehension of the microstructure-driven fatigue damage mechanisms across scales. A substantial fraction of the lifetime for high performance materials is attributed to surface damage accumulation at the microstructural scale (e.g., extrusions and micro crack formation). Although, its modeling is impeded by a lack of comprehensive understanding of the related mechanisms. This makes statistical validation at the same scale by micromechanical experimentation a fundamental requirement. Hence, a large quantity of processed experimental data, which can only be acquired by automated experiments and data analyses, is crucial. Surface damage evolution is often accessed by imaging and subsequent image post-processing. In this work, we evaluated deep learning (DL) methodologies for semantic segmentation and different image processing approaches for quantitative slip trace characterization. Due to limited annotated data, a U-Net architecture was utilized. Three data sets of damage locations observed in scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of ferritic steel, martensitic steel, and copper specimens were prepared. In order to allow the developed models to cope with material-specific damage morphology and imaging-induced variance, a customized augmentation pipeline for the input images was developed. Material domain generalizability of ferritic steel and conjunct material trained models were tested successfully. Multiple image processing routines to detect slip trace orientation (STO) from the DL segmented extrusion areas were implemented and assessed. In conclusion, generalization to multiple materials has been achieved for the DL methodology, suggesting that extending it well beyond fatigue damage is feasible.},

ABSTRACT = {The contour scan strategies in laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) of Ti-6Al-4V were studied at the coupon level. These scan strategies determined the surface qualities and subsurface residual stresses. The correlations to these properties were identified for an optimization of the LPBF processing. The surface roughness and the residual stresses in build direction were linked: combining high laser power and high scan velocities with at least two contour lines substantially reduced the surface roughness, expressed by the arithmetic mean height, from values as high as 30 µm to 13 µm, while the residual stresses rose from ~340 to about 800 MPa. At this stress level, manufactured rocket fuel injector components evidenced macroscopic cracking. A scan strategy completing the contour region at 100 W and 1050 mm/s is recommended as a compromise between residual stresses (625 MPa) and surface quality (14.2 µm). The LPBF builds were monitored with an in-line twin-photodiode-based melt pool monitoring (MPM) system, which revealed a correlation between the intensity quotient I2/I1, the surface roughness, and the residual stresses. Thus, this MPM system can provide a predictive estimate of the surface quality of the samples and resulting residual stresses in the material generated during LPBF.},

ABSTRACT = {We investigate the influence of hydrostatic/biaxial strain on the formation, migration, and clustering of vacancy in tungsten (W) using a first-principles method, and show that the vacancy behaviors are strongly dependent on the strain. Both a monovacancy formation energy and a divacancy binding energy decrease with the increasing of compressive hydrostatic/biaxial strain, but increase with the increasing of tensile strain. Specifically, the binding energy of divacancy changes from negative to positive when the hydrostatic (biaxial) tensile strain is larger than 1.5% (2%). These results indicate that the compressive strain will facilitate the formation of monovacancy in W, while the tensile strain will enhance the attraction between vacancies. This can be attributed to the redistribution of electronic states of W atoms surrounding vacancy. Furthermore, although the migration energy of the monovacancy also exhibits a monotonic linear dependence on the hydrostatic strain, it shows a parabola with an opening down under the biaxial strain. Namely, the vacancy mobility will always be promoted by biaxial strain in W, almost independent of the sign of strain. Such unexpected anisotropic strain-enhanced vacancy mobility originates from the Poisson effect. On the basis of the first-principles results, the nucleation of vacancy clusters in strained W is further determined with the object kinetic Monte Carlo simulations. It is found that the formation time of tri-vacancy decrease significantly with the increasing of tensile strain, while the vacancy clusters are not observed in compressively strained W, indicating that the tensile strain can enhance the formation of voids. Our results provide a good reference for understanding the vacancy behaviors in W.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper deals with the area of structural damage monitoring of steel strands wire ropes embedded into various equipment and mechanical systems. Of the currently available techniques and methods for wire ropes health monitoring, the authors focused on the group of techniques based on operational dynamics investigation of such systems. Beyond the capability and efficiency of both occasionally and continuously monitoring application, the dynamics-based methods are able to provide additional information regarding the structural integrity and functional operability of the entire ensemble embedding the wire ropes. This paper presents the results gained by the authors using a laboratory setup that can simulate the operational condition usually used for regular applications of wire ropes. The investigations were conducted on three directions of acquired signals post-processing. Firstly, the classical fast Fourier transform was used to evaluate the potential changes within the spectral distribution of transitory response. The other two directions involved high-order spectral analyses in terms of bi-spectrum and Wigner–Ville distribution and multi-scale analysis based methods such as complex wavelet cross-correlation and complex wavelet coherency. The results indicate that each direction of analysis can provide suitable information regarding potential wire rope damage, but the ensemble of post-processing methods offers supplementary precision.},

ABSTRACT = {Initiation and propagation of cracks in composite materials can severely affect their global mechanical properties. Due to the lower strength of the interlaminar bonding compared to fibers and the matrix, delamination between plies is known to be one of the most common failure modes in these materials. It is therefore deemed necessary to gain more insight into this type of failure to guide the design of composite structures towards ensuring their robustness and reliability during service. In this work, delamination of interlaminar bonding in composite end-notched flexure (ENF) samples was modeled using a newly developed stochastic 3D extended finite element method (XFEM). The proposed numerical scheme, which also incorporates the cohesive zone model, was used to characterize the mode II delamination results obtained from ENF testing on polyphenylene sulfide (PPS)/glass unidirectional (UD) composites. The nonrepeatable material responses, often seen during fracture testing of UD composites, were well captured with the current numerical model, demonstrating its capacity to predict the stochastic fracture properties of composites under mode II loading conditions.},

ABSTRACT = {It is essential to combine current state-of-the-art technologies such as additive manufacturing with current ecological needs. Due to the increasing demand for non-toxic biodegradable materials and products, human society has been searching for new materials. Consequently, it is compulsory to identify the qualities of these materials and their behavior when subjected to various external factors, to find their optimal solutions for application in various fields. This paper refers to the biodegradable Polylactic acid (PLA)-based filament (commercially known as Extrudr BDP (Biodegradable Plastic) Flax) compared with the biodegradable composite material PLA-lignin filament whose constituent’s trade name is Arboblend V2 Nature as a lignin base material and reinforcement with Extrudr BDP Pearl, a PLA based polymer, 3D printed by Fused Deposition Modeling technology. Certain mechanical properties (tensile strength, bending strength and DMA—Dynamic Mechanical Analysis) were also determined. The tribology behavior (friction coefficient and wear), the structure and the chemical composition of the biodegradable materials were investigated by SEM—Scanning Electron Microscopy, EDX—Energy Dispersive X-Ray Analysis, XRD—X-Ray Diffraction Analysis, FTIR—Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer and TGA—Thermogravimetric Analysis. The paper also refers to the influence of technological parameters on the 3D printed filaments made of Extrudr BDP Flax and the optimization those of technological parameters. The thermal behavior during the heating of the sample was analyzed by Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). As a result of the carried-out research, we intend to recommend these biodegradable materials as possible substituents for plastics in as many fields of activity as possible.},

ABSTRACT = {Understanding the properties of defects is crucial to design higher performance semiconductor materials because they influence the electronic and optical properties significantly. Using ab initio calculations, the dynamics properties of nitrogen interstitial in GaN material, including the configuration, migration, and interaction with vacancy were systematically investigated in the present work. By introducing different sites of foreign nitrogen atom, the most stable configuration of nitrogen interstitial was calculated to show a threefold symmetry in each layer and different charge states were characterized, respectively. In the researches of migration, two migration paths, in-plane and out-of-plane, were considered. With regards to the in-plane migration, an intermediated rotation process was observed first time. Due to this rotation behavior, two different barriers were demonstrated to reveal that the migration is an anisotropic behavior. Additionally, charged nitrogen Frenkel pair was found to be a relatively stable defect complex and its well separation distance was about 3.9 Å. Part of our results are in good agreement with the experimental results, and our work provides underlying insights of the identification and dynamics of nitrogen interstitial in GaN material. This study of defects in GaN material is useful to establish a more complete theory and improve the performance of GaN-based devices.},

ABSTRACT = {The middle ear is one of the smallest biomechanical systems in the human body and is responsible for the hearing process. Hearing is modelled in different ways and by various methods. In this paper, three-degree-of-freedom models of the human middle ear with different viscoelastic properties are proposed. Model 1 uses the Maxwell type viscoelasticity, Model 2 is based on the Kelvin–Voigt viscoelasticity, and Model 3 uses the Kelvin–Voigt viscoelasticity with relaxation effect. The primary aim of the study is to compare the models and their dynamic responses to a voice excitation. The novelty of this study lies in using different models of viscoelasticity and relaxation effect that has been previously unstudied. First, mathematical models of the middle ear were built, then they were solved numerically by the Runge–Kutta procedure and finally, numerical results were compared with those obtained from experiments carried out on the temporal bone with the Laser Doppler Vibrometer. The models exhibit differences in the natural frequency and amplitudes near the second resonance. All analysed models can be used for modelling the rapidly changing processes that occur in the ear and to control active middle ear implants.},

ABSTRACT = {The presence of one-dimensional (1D) nodal lines, which are formed by band crossing points along a line in the momentum space of materials, is accompanied by several interesting features. However, in order to facilitate experimental detection of the band crossing point signatures, the materials must possess a large linear energy range around the band crossing points. In this work, we focused on a topological metal, YB2, with phase stability and a P6/mmm space group, and studied the phonon dispersion, electronic structure, and topological nodal line signatures via first principles. The computed results show that YB2 is a metallic material with one pair of closed nodal lines in the kz = 0 plane. Importantly, around the band crossing points, a large linear energy range in excess of 2 eV was observed, which was rarely reported in previous reports that focus on linear-crossing materials. Furthermore, YB2 has the following advantages: (1) An absence of a virtual frequency for phonon dispersion, (2) an obvious nontrivial surface state around the band crossing point, and (3) small spin–orbit coupling-induced gaps for the band crossing points.},

ABSTRACT = {Extreme atmospheric conditions in the marine and offshore industry are harmful to engineering materials, especially to welded joints, and may cause degradation of their properties. This article presents the results of research on the plasticity of bead-on-plate welds made using two types of seamless, copper plated flux-cored wires. Before welding, spools with wire were stored for 1 month in two distinct locations with different geographical and industrial conditions in Poland, and then subjected to visual examination. Bead-on-plate welds were subjected to a static tensile test and on this basis plasticity indexes showing the effect of storage on plasticity were determined. The fractures after tensile tests and the surfaces of the wires were examined on an electron scanning microscope. Additionally, diffusible hydrogen content in deposited metal measurements for each condition were carried out. The highest degradation level was found for wire stored in an agricultural building in north-eastern Poland—there was an almost fourfold decrease in the plasticity index value and the highest diffusible hydrogen content. For the same wire and the same location, the largest difference was also observed in fracture morphology after the tensile test—ductile fracture was obtained for wire at delivery condition while an almost full cleavage fracture was found after relatively short (1 month) storage of wire.},

The numerical investigation was conducted by the finite element analysis of the representative volume element. Moreover, usage of the novel method of assessment of the speckle pattern applicability for the measurement of local fields by using the digital image correlation method has been proposed.

ABSTRACT = {Generating random aggregate models (RAMs) plays a key role in the mesoscopic modelling of concrete-like composite materials. The arbitrary geometry, wide gradation, and high volume ratio of aggregates pose a great challenge for fast and efficient numerical construction of concrete meso-structures. This paper presents a simple strategy for generating RAMs of concrete based on Laguerre tessellation, which mainly consists of three steps: tessellation, geometric smoothing, and scaling. The computer-assisted design (CAD) file of RAMs obtained by the proposed approach can be directly adopted for the construction of random numerical concrete samples. Combined with the image-based octree meshing algorithm, the scaled boundary finite element method (SBFEM) was adopted for an automatic stress analysis of mass concrete samples, and a parametric study was conducted to investigate the meso-structural effects on concrete elasticity properties. The modelling results successfully reproduced the increasing trend of concrete elastic modulus with the grading of coarse aggregates in literature test data and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.},

Laser powder-bed fusion (LPBF) commonly uses pre-alloyed, fine powders (diameter usually 15–45 µm) to produce fully dense metallic parts. The availability of such fine, pre-alloyed powders reduces the iteration speed of alloy development for LPBF and renders it quite costly. Here, we overcome these drawbacks by performing in-situ alloying in LPBF starting with pure elemental powder mixtures avoiding the use of costly pre-alloyed powders. Pure iron, chromium, and nickel powder mixtures were used to perform in-situ alloying to manufacture 304 L stainless steel cube-shaped samples. Process parameters including scanning speed, laser power, beam diameter, and layer thickness were varied aiming at obtaining a chemically homogeneous alloy. The scientific questions focused on in this work are: which process parameters are required for producing such samples (in part already known in the state of the art), and why are these parameters conducive to homogeneity? Analytical modelling of the melt pool geometry and temperature field suggests that the residence time in the liquid state is the most important parameter controlling the chemical homogeneity of the parts. Results show that in-situ alloying can be successfully employed to enable faster and cost-efficient rapid alloy development.},

ABSTRACT = {The aim of the present study is to provide a computationally efficient and reliable hybrid numerical formulation capable of characterizing the thermomechanical behavior of nanocomposites, which is based on the combination of molecular dynamics (MD) and the finite element method (FEM). A polymeric material is selected as the matrix—specifically, the poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) commonly known as Plexiglas due to its expanded applications. On the other hand, the fullerene C240 is adopted as a reinforcement because of its high symmetry and suitable size. The numerical approach is performed at two scales. First, an analysis is conducted at the nanoscale by utilizing an appropriate nanocomposite unit cell containing the C240 at a high mass fraction. A MD-only method is applied to accurately capture all the internal interfacial effects and accordingly its thermoelastic response. Then, a micromechanical, temperature-dependent finite element analysis takes place using a representative volume element (RVE), which incorporates the first-stage MD output, to study nanocomposites with small mass fractions, whose atomistic-only simulation would require a substantial computational effort. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, numerous numerical results are presented while the investigation is performed in a temperature range that includes the PMMA glass transition temperature, Tg.},

ABSTRACT = {Bowing is a pathology known by the deformation experienced in some external covering systems in ornamental stones, especially in marble, and thermal action is one of the key factors that lead to this degradation. Previous studies presented remarkable contributions about the mechanical behavior of bowing but they were based on classical beam’s theory and improper assumptions might mislead the evaluation of internal stresses. This study proposes to evaluate internal stresses in bowing due to thermal loading considering the true deformed shape in continuum media. Finite displacement concepts are proposed to calculate stress-strain relationship and comparison with linear elastic theory is also addressed. Internal stresses not predictable in the Euler-Bernoulli beam were found in parametric analyses. Moreover, the numerical analysis accomplished in this paper indicates that transient heat flux should induce higher stresses than just considering higher gradients of temperature in steady flux which could explain the larger decohesion through width in bowing tests.},

ABSTRACT = {While repair is mainly used to restore the original part geometry and properties, hybrid manufacturing aims to exploit the benefits of each respective manufacturing process regarding either processing itself or resulting part characteristics. Especially with the current implementation of additive manufacturing in the production of TiAl, turbine blades for both hybrid manufacturing and repair new opportunities are enabled. One main issue is the compatibility of the two or more material types involved, which either differ regarding composition or microstructure or both. In this study, a TNMTM-alloy (Ti-Nb-Mo) was manufactured by different processes (casting, forging, laser additive manufacturing) and identically heat-treated at 1290 °C. Chemical compositions, especially aluminum and oxygen contents, were measured, and the resulting microstructures were analyzed with Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and High-energy X-ray diffraction (HEXRD). The properties were determined by hardness measurements and high-temperature compression tests. The comparison led to an overall assessment of the theoretical compatibility. Experiments to combine several processes were performed to evaluate the practical feasibility. Despite obvious differences in the final phase distribution caused by deviations in the chemical composition, the measured properties of the samples did not differ significantly. The feasibility of combining direct energy deposition (DED) with either casting or laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) was demonstrated by the successful build of the dense, crack-free hybrid material.},

ABSTRACT = {The calibration of any sophisticated model, and in particular a constitutive relation, is a complex problem that has a direct impact in the cost of generating experimental data and the accuracy of its prediction capacity. In this work, we address this common situation using a two-stage procedure. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the model to its parameters, the first step in our approach consists of formulating a meta-model and employing it to identify the most relevant parameters. In the second step, a Bayesian calibration is performed on the most influential parameters of the model in order to obtain an optimal mean value and its associated uncertainty. We claim that this strategy is very efficient for a wide range of applications and can guide the design of experiments, thus reducing test campaigns and computational costs. Moreover, the use of Gaussian processes together with Bayesian calibration effectively combines the information coming from experiments and numerical simulations. The framework described is applied to the calibration of three widely employed material constitutive relations for metals under high strain rates and temperatures, namely, the Johnson–Cook, Zerilli–Armstrong, and Arrhenius models.},

ABSTRACT = {The superior fracture toughness of zirconia is closely correlated with stress-induced martensitic phase transformation around a crack tip. In this study, a modified phase field (PF) model coupling phase transformation and fracture is proposed to study the fracture behavior and toughening effect of tetragonal zirconia polycrystal (TZP). The stress-induced tetragonal to monoclinic (t–m) phase transformation around a static or propagating crack is characterized with PF simulations. It is shown that the finite size and shape of the transformation zone under different loads and ambient temperatures can be well predicted with the proposed PF model. The phase transformation may decrease the stress level around the crack tip, which implies the toughening effect. After that, crack propagation in TZP is studied. As the stress field is perturbed by the phase transformation patterns, the crack may experience deflection and branching in the propagation process. It is found that the toughness of the grain boundaries (GBs) has important influences on the crack propagation mode. For TZP with strong GBs, the crack is more likely to propagate transgranularly while, for TZP with weak GBs, intergranular crack propagation is prevalent. Besides that, the crystal orientation and the external load can also influence the topology of crack propagation.},

ABSTRACT = {Noise has a negative impact on our environment and human health. For this reason, it is necessary to eliminate excessive noise levels. This paper is focused on the study of the sound absorption properties of materials with open-porous structures, which were made of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) material using additive technology. Four types of structures (Cartesian, Octagonal, Rhomboid, and Starlit) were evaluated in this work, and every structure was prepared in three different volume ratios of the porosity and three different thicknesses. The sound absorption properties of the investigated ABS specimens were examined utilizing the normal incidence sound absorption and noise reduction coefficients, which were experimentally determined by the transfer function method using a two-microphone acoustic impedance tube. This work deals with various factors that influence the sound absorption performance of four different types of investigated ABS material’s structures. It was found, in this study, that the sound absorption performance of the investigated ABS specimens is strongly affected by different factors, specifically by the structure geometry, material volume ratio, excitation frequency of an acoustic wave, material’s thickness, and air space size behind the tested sound-absorbing materials.},

ABSTRACT = {Based on first-principles calculations, we study electronic structure of interfaces between a Z2 topological insulator (TI) SnBi2Te4 and a topological crystalline insulator (TCI) SnTe. We consider two interface models characterized by the different atomic structure on the contact of the SnTe(111) and SnBi2Te4(0001) slabs: the model when two materials are connected without intermixing (abrupt type of interface) and the interface model predicted to be realized at epitaxial immersion growth on topological insulator substrates (smooth interface). We find that a strong potential gradient at the abrupt interface leads to the redistribution of the topological states deeper from the interface plane which prevents the annihilation of the Γ¯ Dirac states, predicted earlier. In contrast, a smooth interface is characterized by minor charge transfer, which promotes the strong interplay between TI and TCI Γ¯ Dirac cones leading to their complete annihilation.The M¯ topologically protected Dirac state of SnTe(111) survives irrespective of the interface structure.},

ABSTRACT = {Fibre reinforced plastics have tailorable and superior mechanical characteristics compared to metals and can be used to construct relevant components such as primary crash structures for automobiles. However, the absence of standardized methodologies to predict component level damage has led to their underutilization as compared to their metallic counterparts, which are used extensively to manufacture primary crash structures. This paper presents a methodology that uses crashworthiness results from in-plane impact tests, conducted on carbon-fibre reinforced epoxy flat plates, to tune the related material card in Radioss using two different parametric identification techniques: global and adaptive response search methods. The resulting virtual material model was then successfully validated by comparing the crushing behavior with results obtained from experiments that were conducted by impacting a Formula SAE (Society of Automotive Engineers) crash box. Use of automated identification techniques significantly reduces the development time of composite crash structures, whilst the predictive capability reduces the need for component level tests, thereby making the development process more efficient, automated and economical, thereby reducing the cost of development using composite materials. This in turn promotes the development of vehicles that meet safety standards with lower mass and noxious gas emissions.},

ABSTRACT = {We studied the impact of light polarization on photoinduced dynamics of model azo-polymer chains in two dimensions, using bond-fluctuation Monte Carlo simulations. For two limiting models—sensitive to and independent of light polarization—their dynamics driven by photoisomerization of azo-dyes as well as by thermal effects was studied, including characterization of mass transport and chain reorientations. The corresponding schemes of light–matter interaction promote qualitatively different dynamics of photoinduced motion of azo-polymer chains. In particular, they can inhibit or trigger off a directed mass transport along a gradient of light illumination. The generic dynamics of single chains is superdiffusive and is promoted by breaking a symmetry present in the polarization independent model.},

ABSTRACT = {The article proposes two 3D and 2D numerical FE models of frictional heating for the estimation of temperature distributions in railway tread brake in 1xBg configuration during repeated long-term braking. The results of computations were compared with the time courses of temperature measured using thermocouples throughout the duration of the tests on a full-scale dynamometer for two different brake shoe materials in combination with a steel wheel. The resulting temperature distributions calculated using the proposed models agreed well with the experimental measurements, and the maximum difference in temperature values does not exceed 20%. It has been proven that 2D FE model can be as efficient as 3D model to estimate the temperature distribution during long-term and variable braking in the considered friction node. The differences in the calculation of the temperature values using these models did not exceed 3%, and the calculation time for the 2D model, compared to the 3D model, was shorter approximately 85 times for the braking cycle lasting 5032 s, and approximately 45 times for the braking cycle lasting 3297 s.},

In the present study, the effect of monovacancies and divacancies defects on the solution, clustering and diffusion behaviors of H impurity in fcc-Pd were studied through first principles calculations. Our calculations prove that vacancies behave as an effective sink for H impurities. We found that, although the H-trap efficiency of the larger vacancy defect was reduced, its H-trap ability strengthened. There is a short-ranged area around the vacancy defects in which H impurities tend to diffuse to vacancy defects, gather and form hydrogen bubbles. Therefore, the characteristic of large vacancy defects formation in materials should be considered when screening anti-blistering materials for neutron-producing targets or when designing radiation resistant composite materials.},

ABSTRACT = {The prediction of springback angle for ultra-thin metallic sheets becomes extremely difficult with the existence of size effects. In this study, size effects on the springback behavior of CuZn20 foils are investigated by experiments and analytical methods. The experimental results reveal that the springback angle first decreases gradually and then increases markedly with the decrease of foil thickness, which cannot be analyzed by current theoretical models. Then, an analytical model based on the Taylor-based nonlocal theory of plasticity is developed, in which the drastic increases of both the proportion of surface grains and the strain gradient are taken into account. Moreover, the influence of strain gradient is modified by the grain-boundary blocking factor. The calculation results show that the springback angle of foils is determined by the intrinsic competition between the decrement angle caused by surface grains and the increment angle caused by the strain gradient. Besides, the relative error of predicted springback angle by the model is less than 15%, which means that the developed model is very useful for improving the quality of micro sheet parts with high accuracy of springback prediction.},

ABSTRACT = {The effect of halide composition on the structural, electronic, and optical properties of CsPb(Br1−xClx)3 perovskite was investigated in this study. When the chloride (Cl) content of x was increased, the unit cell volume decreased with a linear function. Theoretical X-ray diffraction analyses showed that the peak (at 2θ = 30.4°) shifts to a larger angle (at 2θ = 31.9°) when the average fraction of the incorporated Cl increased. The energy bandgap (Eg) was observed to increase with the increase in Cl concentration. For x = 0.00, 0.25, 0.33, 0.50, 0.66, 0.75, and 1.00, the Eg values calculated using the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof potential were between 1.53 and 1.93 eV, while those calculated using the modified Becke−Johnson generalized gradient approximation (mBJ–GGA) potential were between 2.23 and 2.90 eV. The Eg calculated using the mBJ–GGA method best matched the experimental values reported. The effective masses decreased with a concentration increase of Cl to 0.33 and then increased with a further increase in the concentration of Cl. Calculated photoabsorption coefficients show a blue shift of absorption at higher Cl content. The calculations indicate that CsPb(Br1−xClx)3 perovskite could be used in optical and optoelectronic devices by partly replacing bromide with chloride.},

ABSTRACT = {Understanding and simulating the dynamic response of quasi-brittle materials still remains as one of the most challenging issues in structural engineering. This paper presents the damage propagation material model (DAMP) developed in order to obtain reliable results for use in structural engineering practice. A brief overview focuses on the differences between fracture mechanics studies, and engineering material modelling is presented to highlight possible guideline improvements. An experimental dynamic test performed on ultra-high-performance concrete specimens was used to obtain evidence of the physical behaviour of brittle materials with respect to specimen size variations and, consequently, to verify the reliability of the material equations proposed. Two widely used material models (RHT and M72R3), as representatives of the classical brittle material models for structural purposes, and the proposed material model are compared. Here, we show how: (i) the multiple structural strength of brittle materials arises from the damage propagation process, (ii) there is no contradiction between fracture mechanics and the engineering approach once the velocity of damage propagation is chosen as fundamental material property and (iii) classical dynamic material models are intrinsically not objective with related loss of predictive capability. Finally, the original material model equation and the experimental strategy, dedicated to its extended verification, will be shown in order to increase the design predictiveness in the dynamic range considering structure and specimen size variations. The dynamic stress increasing factor (DIF), experimentally observed and widely recognised in literature as a fundamental concept for quasi-brittle material modelling, has been reviewed and decomposed in its geometrical and material dependencies. The new material model defines its DIF starting from the physical quantities of the damage propagation velocity applied to the test case boundary conditions. The resultant material model predictiveness results improved greatly, demonstrating its ability to model several dynamic events considering size and dynamic load variations with a unique material property set without showing contradictions between numerical and experimental approaches.},

ABSTRACT = {The material properties of thermoplastic polymer parts manufactured by the extrusion-based additive manufacturing process are highly dependent on the thermal history. Different numerical models have been proposed to simulate the thermal history of a 3D-printed part. However, they are limited due to limited geometric applicability; low accuracy; or high computational demand. Can the time–temperature history of a 3D-printed part be simulated by a computationally less demanding, fast numerical model without losing accuracy? This paper describes the numerical implementation of a simplified discrete-event simulation model that offers accuracy comparable to a finite element model but is faster by two orders of magnitude. Two polymer systems with distinct thermal properties were selected to highlight differences in the simulation of the orthotropic response and the temperature-dependent material properties. The time–temperature histories from the numerical model were compared to the time–temperature histories from a conventional finite element model and were found to match closely. The proposed highly parallel numerical model was approximately 300–500 times faster in simulating thermal history compared to the conventional finite element model. The model would enable designers to compare the effects of several printing parameters for specific 3D-printed parts and select the most suitable parameters for the part.},

ABSTRACT = {In order to provide a better understanding of the phenomena that define the weld bead penetration and melting rate of consumables in underwater welding, welds were developed with a rutile electrode in air welding conditions and at the simulated depths of 5 and 10 m with the use of a hyperbaric chamber and a gravity feeding system. In this way, voltage and current signals were acquired. Data processing involved the welding voltage, determination of the sum of the anodic and cathodic drops, calculation of the short-circuit factor, and determination of the melting rate. Cross-sectional samples were also taken from the weld bead to assess bead geometry. As a result, the collected data show that the generation of energy in the arc–electrode connection in direct polarity (direct current electrode negative-DCEN) is affected by the hydrostatic pressure, causing a loss of fusion efficiency, a drop of operating voltage, decreased arc length, and increased number of short-circuit events. The combination of these characteristics kept the weld bead geometry unchanged, compared to dry weld conditions. With the positive electrode (direct current electrode positive-DCEP), radial losses were derived from greater arc lengths resulting from increasing hydrostatic pressure, which led to a decrease in weld penetration.},

ABSTRACT = {Characterization of the tensile mechanical behaviors of rocks under dynamic loads is of great significance for the practical engineering. However, thus far, its micromechanics have rarely been studied. This paper micromechanically investigated the compression-induced tensile mechanical behaviors of the crystalline rock using the grain-based model (GBM) by universal distinct element code (UDEC). Results showed that the crystalline rock has the rate- and heterogeneity-dependency of tensile behaviors. Essentially, dynamic Brazilian tensile strength increased in a linear manner as the loading rate increased. With the size distribution and morphology of grain-scale heterogeneity weakened, it increased, and this trend was obviously enhanced as the loading rate increased. Additionally, the rate-dependent characteristic became strong with the grain heterogeneity weakened. The grain heterogeneity prominently affected the stress distribution inside the synthetic crystalline rock, especially in the mixed compression and tension zone. Due to heterogeneity, there were tensile stress concentrations (TSCs) in the sample which could favor microcracking and strength weakening of the sample. As the grain heterogeneity weakened or the loading rate increased, the magnitude of the TSC had a decreasing trend and there was a transition from the sharp TSC to the smooth tensile stress distribution zone. The progressive failure of the crystalline rock was notably influenced by the loading rate, which mainly represented the formation of the crushing zone adjacent to two loading points. Our results are meaningful for the practical engineering such as underground protection works from stress waves.},

ABSTRACT = {The novel ternary carbides and nitrides, known as MAX phase materials with remarkable combined metallic and ceramic properties, offer various engineering and technological applications. Using ab initio calculations based on generalized gradient approximation (GGA), local density approximation (LDA), and the quasiharmonic Debye model; the electronic, structural, elastic, mechanical, and thermodynamic properties of the M2GaC (M = Zr, Hf) MAX phase were investigated. The optimized lattice parameters give the first reference to the upcoming theocratical and experimental studies, while the calculated elastic constants are in excellent agreement with the available data. Moreover, obtained elastic constants revealed that both the Zr2GaC and Hf2GaC MAX phases are brittle. The band structure and density of states analysis showed that these MAX phases are electrical conductors, having strong directional bonding between M-C (M = Zr, Hf) atoms due to M-d and C-p hybridization. Formation and cohesive energies, and phonon calculations showed that Zr2GaC and Hf2GaC MAX phases’ compounds are thermodynamically and dynamically stable and can be synthesized experimentally. Finally, the effect of temperature and pressure on volume, heat capacity, Debye temperature, Grüneisen parameter, and thermal expansion coefficient of M2GaC (M = Zr, Hf) are evaluated using the quasiharmonic Debye model from the nonequilibrium Gibbs function in the temperature and pressure range 0–1600 K and 0–50 GPa respectively.},

ABSTRACT = {The electromagnetic properties of structures with spatially periodic distributed graded refractive index were investigated in the terahertz frequency range. The band structure and electromagnetic response of material with harmonically distributed refractive index were calculated and analyzed. The analytical expressions for frequencies of the first and second bandgap are derived. 3D printed gyroid based architectures were proven to be harmonically graded refractive index structures with designed bandgaps in THz frequency ranges. The transmission coefficient of thermoplastic polyurethane-based samples were experimentally measured in the frequency range 100–500 GHz and compared with theoretical results. Due to losses in the real world produced samples, the predicted response is significantly dumped in the terahertz range and only traces of band gaps are experimentally observed. This funding paves the way toward a new generation of 3D printed THz components for gradient-index optics applications.},

ABSTRACT = {Multiple site damage (MSD) cracks are small fatigue cracks that may accumulate at the sides of highly loaded holes in aging aircraft structures. The presence of MSD cracks can drastically reduce the residual strength of fuselage panels. In this paper, artificial neural networks (ANN) modeling is used for predicting the residual strength of aluminum panels with MSD cracks. Experimental data that include 147 unique configurations of aluminum panels with MSD cracks are used. The experimental dataset includes three different aluminum alloys (2024-T3, 2524-T3, and 7075-T6), four different test panel configurations (unstiffened, stiffened, stiffened with a broken middle stiffener, and bolted lap-joints), many different panel widths and thicknesses, and the sizes of the lead and MSD cracks. The results presented in this paper demonstrate that a single ANN model can predict the residual strength for all materials and configurations with high accuracy. Specifically, the overall mean absolute error for the ANN model predictions is 3.82%. Furthermore, the ANN model residual strength predictions are compared to those obtained using the most accurate semi-analytical and computational approaches from the literature. The ANN model predictions are found to be at the same accuracy level of these approaches, and they even outperform the other approaches for many configurations.},

ABSTRACT = {This study investigated the influence of the curing time on the fracture toughness of concrete produced with different content of low calcium fly ash (LCFA). During the study, the amounts of 20% and 30% of pozzolanic additive were used. In order to observe the effect of the applied pozzolanic additive on the analyzed concrete properties, the obtained results were compared with the values obtained for the reference concrete. Compressive strength—fcm and fracture toughness, by using mode II loading—KIIc (shearing), were determined between the 3rd and 365th days of curing. In the course of experiments, changes in the development of cracks in individual series of concrete were also analyzed. In addition, the microstructures of all composites and the nature of macroscopic crack propagation in mature concretes were assessed. It was observed that the greatest increase in fracture toughness at shear was in the case of reference concrete during the first 28 days, whereas, in the case of concretes containing LCFA, in the period of time above 4 weeks. Furthermore, concrete without the LCFA additives were characterized by a brittle fracture. In contrast to it, concretes with LCFA additives are mainly characterized by a quasi-plastic process of failure. Moreover, most of the samples showed a typical pattern of the destruction that occurs as a result of shearing. The presented test results may be helpful in selecting the composition of concrete mixtures containing LCFA to be used in concrete and reinforced concrete structures subjected to shear loads.},

ABSTRACT = {The aim of this work is to simulate the fragmentation of bullets impacted through granular media, in this case, sand. In order to validate the simulation, a group of experiments were conducted with the sand contained in two different box prototypes. The walls of the first box were constructed with fiberglass and the second with plywood. The prototypes were subjected to the impact force of bullets fired 15 m away from the box. After the shots, X-ray photographs were taken to observe the penetration depth. Transient numerical analyses were conducted to simulate these physical phenomena by using the smooth particle hydrodynamics (SPH) module of ANSYS® 2019 AUTODYN software. Advantageously, this module considers the granular media as a group of uniform particles capable of transferring kinetic energy during the elastic collision component of an impact. The experimental results demonstrated a reduction in the maximum bullet kinetic energy of 2750 J to 100 J in 0.8 ms. The numerical results compared with the X-ray photographs showed similar results demonstrating the capability of sand to dissipate kinetic energy and the fragmentation of the bullet caused at the moment of impact.},

ABSTRACT = {Recently, increasing demand for the accurate assessment of the structural integrity and fitness-for-service (FFS) analysis of engineering structures has elevated constraint effects to one of the most important issues in fracture mechanics and structural integrity research. In this paper, the effect of crack tip constraints are investigated on the fracture toughness assessment of 9% Ni steel for application in liquefied natural gas storage tanks. Crack tip opening displacement (CTOD) tests were conducted using both conventional standard three-point bending (3PB) and wide plate (WP) specimens at a cryogenic temperature of −196 °C. The distribution of the stress and strain fields near the crack tip in the 3PB and WP specimens were then obtained by FE (Finite Elements) analysis. Based on both the experimental and numerical results, the parameters of the Weibull distribution were obtained to evaluate the critical Weibull stress at brittle fracture. The equivalent CTOD ratio β is defined as the ratio of the CTOD of the 3PB specimen to the CTOD of the WP specimen at the same Weibull stress. The application of the proposed CTOD toughness correction method to the WP results was then demonstrated in the context of a failure assessment diagram (FAD). It was determined that the conventional evaluation yields an excessively conservative result for WP specimens, but can be reasonably reduced by applying β.},

ABSTRACT = {Recent studies have shown that the use of membranes based on artificial nanoporous materials can be effective for desalination and decontamination of water, separation of ions and gases as well as for solutions to other related problems. Before the expensive stages of synthesis and experimental testing, the search of the optimal dimensions and geometry of nanopores for the water desalination membranes can be done using computer-aided design. In the present study, we propose and examine the assumption that rectangular nanopores with a high aspect ratio would demonstrate excellent properties in terms of water permeation rate and ion rejection. Using the non-equilibrium molecular dynamic simulations, the properties of promising hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) membranes with rectangular nanopores were predicted. It has been found that not only the nanopore width but also its design (“armchair” or “zigzag”) determines the permeability and ion selectivity of the h-BN-based membrane. The results show that membranes with a zigzag-like design of nanopores of ~6.5 Å width and the armchair-like nanopores of ~7.5 Å width possess better efficiency compared with other considered geometries. Moreover, the estimated efficiency of these membranes is higher than that of any commercial membranes and many other previously studied single-layer model membranes with other designs of the nanopores.},

This work studied additive manufacturing processing parameters at various processing stages on final printed part performance, specifically how altering featured wall thickness and layer height combine to affect final porosity. Results showed that reducing the layer height yielded a 90% improvement in pristine porosity reduction. Optimal processing parameters were combined and utilized to design and print a closed additive manufacturing molding tool to demonstrate flexible composite manufacturing by fabricating a composite laminate. Non-destructive and destructive methods were used to analyze the composite structures. Compared to the well-established composite manufacturing processes of hand lay-up and vacuum-assisted resin transfer molding methods, additive manufacturing molding composites were shown to have comparable material strength properties.},

ABSTRACT = {In the present work, modified embedded atom potential and large-scale molecular dynamics’ simulations were used to explore the effect of grain boundary (GB) segregated foreign interstitials on the deformation behavior of nanocrystalline (nc) iron. As a case study, carbon and nitrogen (about 2.5 at.%) were added to (nc) iron. The tensile test results showed that, at the onset of plasticity, grain boundary sliding mediated was dominated, whereas both dislocations and twinning were prevailing deformation mechanisms at high strain. Adding C/N into GBs reduces the free excess volume and consequently increases resistance to GB sliding. In agreement with experiments, the flow stress increased due to the presence of carbon or nitrogen and carbon had the stronger impact. Additionally, the simulation results revealed that GB reduction and suppressing GBs’ dislocation were the primary cause for GB strengthening. Moreover, we also found that the stress required for both intragranular dislocation and twinning nucleation were strongly dependent on the solute type.},

ABSTRACT = {The mixer is the most widely used batch mixing equipment in the rubber industry. The rotor is a core component and has a great impact on the mixing effect of the equipment. The current rotor structure design is done empirically, being tightly dependent on practical experience. This paper proposes a method for optimizing the rotor structure by using optimization algorithms combined with numerical simulation technology. Using MATLAB software, a parametric design program for synchronous rotors and a set of optimization programs for the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm were written. The global distribution index was used as the fitness function to optimize the synchronous rotor configuration. A comparative analysis of the rotors before and after optimization shows that the optimization process is feasible, and the results are reliable. This provides new ideas for the design and development of mixer rotors.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper modelled the cutting process of a bundle consisted of ultra-thin cold-rolled steel sheets using a guillotine. The geometry of a cutting tool with given dimensions was assumed. A bundle of sheets being cut was modelled as deformable, the cutting tool was rigid, and the finite element method along with computer system LS-DYNA was employed. Numerical simulations of the complex state of stress and of the corresponding complex state of strain were carried out. Cutting processes belong to fast changing physical phenomena, and therefore, highly nonlinear dynamical algorithms were applied in order to solve this particular problem. Experimental investigations were also conducted by means of the scanning electron microscopy. It was found that the fracture region consisted of two distinct zones: brittle and ductile separated from each other by the interfacial transition. Morphological features of the brittle, ductile, and the transition regions were identified. The ductile and brittle zones were separated at the depth of ca. 1/5 thickness of the cut steel sheet. Finally, the numerical results obtained by usage of the finite element method as well as experimental ones in the form of microscopic images were compared, showing quite good agreement.},

Due to the wide range of applications of deep learning, among others in speech recognition, bioinformation processing, and medication design, the extent was checked to which it is possible to obtain information related to the prediction of the compressive strength of bone cements. Development and improvement of deep learning network (DLN) algorithms and statistical modeling in the analysis of changes in the mechanical parameters of the tested materials will enable determining an acceptable margin of error during surgery or cement preparation in relation to the expected strength of the material used to fill bone cavities. The use of the abovementioned computer methods may, therefore, play a significant role in the initial qualitative assessment of the effects of procedures and, thus, mitigation of errors resulting in failure to maintain the required mechanical parameters and patient dissatisfaction.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, a comparison of the mechanical properties of high-strength low-alloy S460N steel welded joints is presented. The welded joints were made by the gas metal arc welding (GMAW) process in the air environment and water, by the local cavity welding method. Welded joints were tested following the EN ISO 15614-1:2017 standard. After welding, the non-destructive—visual, penetrant, radiographic, and ultrasonic (phased array) tests were performed. In the next step, the destructive tests, as static tensile-, bending-, impact- metallographic (macroscopic and microscopic) tests, and Vickers HV10 measurements were made. The influence of weld porosity on the mechanical properties of the tested joints was also assessed. The performed tests showed that the tensile strength of the joints manufactured in water (567 MPa) could be similar to the air welded joint (570 MPa). The standard deviations from the measurements were—47 MPa in water and 33 MPa in the air. However, it was also stated that in the case of a complex state of stress, for example, bending, torsional and tensile stresses, the welding imperfections (e.g., pores) significantly decrease the properties of the welded joint. In areas characterized by porosity the tensile strength decreased to 503 MPa. Significant differences were observed for bending tests. During the bending of the underwater welded joint, a smaller bending angle broke the specimen than was the case during the air welded joint bending. Also, the toughness and hardness of joints obtained in both environments were different. The minimum toughness for specimens welded in water was 49 J (in the area characterized by high porosity) and in the air it was 125 J (with a standard deviation of 23 J). The hardness in the heat-affected zone (HAZ) for the underwater joint in the non-tempered area was above 400 HV10 (with a standard deviation of 37 HV10) and for the air joint below 300 HV10 (with a standard deviation of 17 HV10). The performed investigations showed the behavior of S460N steel, which is characterized by a high value of carbon equivalent (CeIIW) 0.464%, during local cavity welding.},

ABSTRACT = {The comparison of shear stress determination methods in tubular specimens under torsion is presented in this paper. Four methods were analyzed: purely elastic solutions, purely plastic solutions, the midsection approach, and the Chaboche nonlinear kinematic hardening model. Using experimental data from self-designed and conducted fatigue experiments, an interesting insight on this problem was obtained that is not often tackled in the literature. It was shown that there are differences in determined shear stress values, and their level depends on a few factors. The midsection approach and purely plastic solution gave values of surface shear stress very close to the values obtained using the Chaboche nonlinear kinematic hardening model for high strain levels. The purely elastic solution gave proper results for the low strain ranges, close to the cyclic yield limit. Since none of the methods can be trusted in the full range of loading, an important conclusion from these analyses regards the formulated ranges of their applicability. It was also shown that the calculated values of shear stress and plastic and elastic strain energy density determined on this basis have a strong impact on fatigue life predictions. Finally, the influence of predicted values of shear stresses on the interpretation of cyclic hardening phenomena was also presented.},

ABSTRACT = {A new environmentally friendly method of photoreactive pressure-sensitive adhesives (PSAs) preparation was demonstrated. PSAs based on n-butyl acrylate (BA), acrylic acid (AA) and 4-acryloyloxy benxophenone (ABP) were prepared via the UV-induced cotelomerization process in the presence of a radical photoinitiator (acylphosphine oxide) and telogen (tetrabromomethane). Hydroxyterminated polybutadiene was used as a crosslinking agent. Influence of AA concentration (0–10 wt %) on kinetics of the cotelomerization process was investigated using a photodifferential scanning calorimetry method, selected physicochemical features of obtained photoreactive BA/AA/ABP cotelomers (molecular masses, polydispersity, monomers conversion and dynamic viscosity) and self-adhesive properties of obtained PSAs (adhesion, tack and cohesion) were studied, as well. It turned out that AA content is the important factor that influences monomers conversion (thereby the volatile parts content in prepolymer) and PSAs’ properties. As the acrylic acid content increases, the reaction rate increases, but the total monomers conversion and the solid content of the prepolymer decreases. Additionally, the adhesion and cohesion of PSAs were grown up, and their tackiness decreased. However, the AA content has no effect on molecular weights (Mw and Mn) and polydispersity (c.a. 1.5) of photoreactive cotelomers. The optimal AA content necessary to obtain a prepolymer with low volatile parts content and good PSA properties was determined.},

ABSTRACT = {The studies about the effect of the graphene reinforcement ratio and machining parameters to improve the machining performance of Ti6Al4V alloy are still rare and incomplete to meet the Industry 4.0 manufacturing criteria. In this study, a hybrid adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) with a multi-objective particle swarm optimization method is developed to obtain the optimal combination of milling parameters and reinforcement ratio that lead to minimize the feed force, depth force, and surface roughness. For achieving this, Ti6Al4V matrix nanocomposites reinforced with 0 wt.%, 0.6 wt.%, and 1.2 wt.% graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) are produced. Afterward, a full factorial approach was used to design experiments to investigate the effect of cutting speed, feed rate, and graphene nanoplatelets ratio on machining behaviour. After that, artificial intelligence based on ANFIS is used to develop prediction models as the fitness function of the multi-objective particle swarm optimization method. The experimental results showed that the developed models can obtain an accurate estimation of depth force, feed force, and surface roughness with a mean absolute percentage error of 3.87%, 8.56%, and 2.21%, respectively, as compared with experimentally measured outputs. In addition, the developed artificial intelligence models showed 361.24%, 35.05%, and 276.47% less errors for depth force, feed force, and surface roughness, respectively, as compared with the traditional mathematical models. The multi-objective optimization results from the new approach indicated that a cutting speed of 62 m/min, feed rate of 139 mm/min, and GNPs reinforcement ratio of 1.145 wt.% lead to the improved machining characteristics of GNPs reinforced Ti6Al4V matrix nanocomposites. Henceforth, the hybrid method as a novel artificial intelligent method can be used for optimizing the machining processes with complex relationships between the output responses.},

ABSTRACT = {Hydrogen embrittlement, which severely affects structural materials such as steel, comprises several mechanisms at the atomic level. One of them is hydrogen enhanced decohesion (HEDE), the phenomenon of H accumulation between cleavage planes, where it reduces the interplanar cohesion. Grain boundaries are expected to play a significant role for HEDE, since they act as trapping sites for hydrogen. To elucidate this mechanism, we present the results of first-principles studies of the H effect on the cohesive strength of α-Fe single crystal (001) and (111) cleavage planes, as well as on the Σ5(310)[001] and Σ3(112)[11¯0] symmetrical tilt grain boundaries. The calculated results show that, within the studied range of concentrations, the single crystal cleavage planes are much more sensitive to a change in H concentration than the grain boundaries. Since there are two main types of procedures to perform ab initio tensile tests, different in whether or not to allow the relaxation of atomic positions, which can affect the quantitative and qualitative results, these methods are revisited to determine their effect on the predicted cohesive strength of segregated interfaces.},

ABSTRACT = {The article presents a comparative analysis of the impact of the addition of steel and polypropylene fibers on the properties of the concrete mixes and hardened concrete used in the concrete floor industry. The behavior of concrete intended for floors is different from conventional structural concrete because it is formed horizontally; until now, the effect of steel and polypropylene fibers on the properties of concrete formed horizontally has not yet been fully understood. Therefore, the aim of this article is to examine this issue and compare the behavior of concrete modified with steel and polypropylene fibers in concrete that is formed horizontally. The following properties of fresh concrete mixes were analyzed: consistency, the content of air-voids, and bulk density. Consequently, the following properties of hardened concrete were analyzed: compressive strength, bending tensile strength, and brittleness. It was confirmed that steel and polypropylene fibers have a different type of effect on the properties of fresh concrete mixes and hardened concrete. Finally, a combined economic and mechanical analysis was performed.},

ABSTRACT = {Sulfuric acid under different concentrations and with the addition of SO3 (fuming sulfuric acid) was studied as a reducing agent for the production of reduced graphene oxide (RGO). Three concentrations of sulfuric acid (1.5, 5, and 12 M), as well as 12 M with 30% SO3, were used. The reduction of graphene oxide increased with H2SO4 concentration as observed by Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. It was observed that GO lost primarily epoxide functional groups from 40.4 to 9.7% and obtaining 69.8% carbon when using 12 M H2SO4, without leaving sulfur doping. Additionally, the appearance of hexagonal domain structures observed in transmission electron microscopy and analyzed by selected area electron diffraction patterns confirmed the improvement in graphitization. Although the addition of SO3 in H2SO4 improved the GO reduction with 74% carbon, as measured by XPS, the use of SO3 introduced sulfur doping of 1.3%. RGO produced with sulfuric acid was compared with a sample obtained via ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, a very common reduction route, by observing that the RGO produced with sulfuric acid had a higher C/O ratio than the material reduced by UV irradiation. This work showed that sulfuric acid can be used as a single-step reducing agent for RGO without sulfur contamination.},

ABSTRACT = {Understanding the strengthening effect of niobium on ferrite grain boundaries from the perspective of valence electron structures will help to use niobium and other microalloying elements more effectively to improve the performance of steel materials. In this paper, the effect of niobium element on ferrite grain boundary strengthening is studied based on microstructure analysis at the nanometer scale. The enrichment of niobium in pipeline steel at ferrite boundary was observed by a three-dimensional atomic probe test. Segregation of Nb is observed in the ferrite grain boundaries of X70 steel, and its maximum concentration is 0.294–0.466 at.%. The charges in the occupancy of the Fe 3d state in grain and grain boundary were 7.23 and 7.37, respectively, based on quantitative analysis of electron energy loss spectra (EELS). The first-principle calculation suggests that the charges in the occupancy of 3d state for grain boundary iron are 6.57 and 6.68, respectively, before and after the Nb doping (with an increase of 1.67%), which reveals a similar trend to that of the EELS results. Through Nb alloying, the 3d valence electronic density of the state of Fe in grain boundary moves to a lower energy, which can reduce the total energy of the system and make the grain boundary more stable. Meanwhile, the charges in the occupancy of the 3d state for Fe in the grain boundary increases, providing more electrons for grain boundary bonding. These improve the strength and toughness of the material. This work provides a fundamental understanding for pipeline steel strengthening by element alloying.},

ABSTRACT = {A study on the strength of ceramic fiber bundles based on experimental and computational procedures is presented. Tests were performed on single filaments and bundles composed of two fibers with different nominal fiber counts. A method based on fiber rupture signals was developed to estimate the amount of filament rupture during the test. Through this method, the fiber bundle true strength was determined and its variation with the initial fiber count observed. By using different load-sharing models and the single filament data as input parameter, simulations were also developed to verify this behavior. Through different approaches between experiments and simulations, it was noted that the fiber bundle true strength increased with the fiber count. Moreover, a variation of the fibers’ final proportion in the bundles relative to the initial amount was verified in both approaches. Finally, discussions on the influence of different load-sharing models on the results are presented.},

ABSTRACT = {One important challenge that faces the metallurgic industry turns around the constant increment in the mechanical resistance of certain finished products. Metallurgic advantages can be obtained from the inclusion of microparticles in metallic materials, but this inclusion involves complex challenges as the internal stress distribution can be modified. In this work, the simulation of a cooling sequence in 7075 aluminum with a SiO2 microparticle is presented. Two models of two-dimensional (2D) type were constructed in ANSYS®2019 with circular and oval shape microparticles located inside the aluminum. Both models were subjected to the same thermomechanical transient analysis to compare the remaining stress distributions around the microparticles after the thermal load and to observe the effect of the geometrical shape. The results show remaining stresses increased in the oval model as a consequence of the geometrical shape modification. After applying a tension load in the analyzed specimens, shear stress concentrations were observed with a higher magnitude around the covertex of the oval shape. The results can be very useful for the creation of materials with controlled remnant stress located in specific or desired locations in the matrix.},

ABSTRACT = {A traditional penetration test only measures the total penetration within 5 s. The penetration process is not monitored, and therefore, a large amount of information on the deformation properties of asphalt is not used. This paper documents a study to use a high-speed camera to quantify the entire penetration process and use the Finite Element Method (FEM) to interpret the penetration process using a viscoelastic model. The penetration–time relationships of several asphalt binders (70#, 90#, a rubber modified binder, and a styrene-butadiene-styrene (SBS) modified binder) have been acquired using the new method, and the FEM modeling of the penetration processes is performed. The results show that both stress relaxation and creep appear during the penetration process. The results indicate that the improved test method and its data interpretation procedure may better characterize the properties of asphalt binder, which may extend the applications of the traditional penetration test.},

ABSTRACT = {One possibility in order to manufacture products with very few restrictions in design freedom is additive manufacturing. For advanced acoustic design measures like Acoustic Black Holes (ABH), the layer-wise material deposition allows the continuous alignment of the mechanical impedance by different filling patterns and degrees of filling. In order to explore the full design potential, mechanical models are indispensable. In dependency on process parameters, the resulting homogenized material parameters vary. In previous investigations, especially for ABH structures, a dependency of the material parameters on the structure’s thickness can be observed. In this contribution, beams of different thicknesses are investigated experimentally and numerically in order to identify the material parameters in dependency on the frequency and the thickness. The focused material is polyactic acid (PLA). A parameter fitting is conducted by use of a 3D finite element model and it’s reduced version in a Krylov subspace. The results yield homogenized material parameters for the PLA stack as a function of frequency and thickness. An increasing Young’s modulus with increasing frequency and increasing thickness is observed. This observed effect has considerable influence and has not been considered so far. With the received parameters, more reliable results can be obtained.},

ABSTRACT = {The necessity to progress towards sustainability has inspired modern researchers to examine the lubrication and cooling effects of vegetable oils on conventional metal cutting operations. Consequently, as an eco-friendly vegetable product, castor oil can be the right choice as Minimum quantity lubrication (MQL) base fluid. Nonetheless, the high viscosity of castor oil limits its flowability and restricts its industrial application. Conversely, palm oil possesses superior lubricity, as well as flowability characteristics. Hence, an attempt has been made to improve the lubrication behavior of castor oil. Here, six castor-palm mixtures (varying from 1:0.5–1:3) were utilized as MQL-fluid, and the values of machining responses viz. average surface roughness, specific cutting energy, and tool wear were evaluated. Furthermore, an integrated Shannon’s Entropy-based Technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) framework was employed for selecting the most suitable volume ratio of castor-palm oil mixture. The rank provided by the TOPSIS method confirmed that 1:2 was the best volume ratio for castor-palm oil mixture. Afterward, a comparative analysis demonstrated that the best castor-palm volume fraction resulted in 8.262 and 16.146% lowering of surface roughness, 5.459 and 7.971% decrement of specific cutting energy, 2.445 and 3.155% drop in tool wear compared to that of castor and palm oil medium, respectively.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper presents the results of the fracture toughness of concretes containing two mineral additives. During the tests, the method of loading the specimens according to Mode I fracture was used. The research included an evaluation of mechanical parameters of concrete containing noncondensed silica fume (SF) in an amount of 10% and siliceous fly ash (FA) in the following amounts: 0%, 10% and 20%. The experiments were carried out on mature specimens, i.e., after 28 days of curing and specimens at an early age, i.e., after 3 and 7 days of curing. In the course of experiments, the effect of adding SF to the value of the critical stress intensity factor—KIcS in FA concretes in different periods of curing were evaluated. In addition, the basic strength parameters of concrete composites, i.e., compressive strength—fcm and splitting tensile strength—fctm, were measured. A novelty in the presented research is the evaluation of the fracture toughness of concretes with two mineral additives, assessed at an early age. During the tests, the structures of all composites and the nature of macroscopic crack propagation were also assessed. A modern and useful digital image correlation (DIC) technique was used to assess macroscopic cracks. Based on the conducted research, it was found the application of SF to FA concretes contributes to a significant increase in the fracture toughness of these materials at an early age. Moreover, on the basis of the obtained test results, it was found that the values of the critical stress intensity factor of analyzed concretes were convergent qualitatively with their strength parameters. It also has been demonstrated that in the first 28 days of concrete curing, the preferred solution is to replace cement with SF in the amount of 10% or to use a cement binder substitution with a combination of additives in proportions 10% SF + 10% FA. On the other hand, the composition of mineral additives in proportions 10% SF + 20% FA has a negative effect on the fracture mechanics parameters of concretes at an early age. Based on the analysis of the results of microstructural tests and the evaluation of the propagation of macroscopic cracks, it was established that along with the substitution of the cement binder with the combination of mineral additives, the composition of the cement matrix in these composites changes, which implies a different, i.e., quasi-plastic, behavior in the process of damage and destruction of the material.},

ABSTRACT = {This research aims to examine the fracture toughness of hybrid fibrous geopolymer composites under mode II. For this purpose, eight geopolymer mixtures were cast and tested to evaluate the influence of steel and synthetic fiber hybridization on mode II fracture response. The first mixture was plain and was kept as a reference, while steel, polypropylene and glass fibers were used in the rest seven mixtures. The first three of which were mono-reinforced with one of the three fibers, while the rest of the four were hybrids reinforced with combinations of steel and synthetic fibers. The Brazilian center notched disc and the double notched cube test configurations were used to evaluate the mode II fracture toughness of the eight mixtures. The results of the tests showed that steel fibers played the vital role in enhancing the fracture toughness, where the mixtures S1.6 and S1.3G0.3 showed the best performance. The results also showed that increasing the notch depth decreased the fracture toughness with an approximate linear decrement fashion. It was found that the use of double-notched cubes resulted in much higher fracture toughness than the Brazilian notched discs, where the ratio of normalized fracture toughness of the disc specimens to cube specimens was approximately 0.37 to 0.47. This is attributed to the concentration of stresses along one defined path in the disc specimens compared to the multi-path stresses in the cube specimens. In addition, the accompanied tensile stresses in the disc specimens may lead to a mode I fracture before the designed mode II fracture.},

ABSTRACT = {In the present work, for the first time, free vibration response of angle ply laminates with uncertainties is attempted using Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline (MARS), Artificial Neural Network-Particle Swarm Optimization (ANN-PSO), Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), and Adaptive Network Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS). The present approach employed 2D C0 stochastic finite element (FE) model based on the Third Order Shear Deformation Theory (TSDT) in conjunction with MARS, ANN-PSO, GPR, and ANFIS. The TSDT model used eliminates the requirement of shear correction factor owing to the consideration of the actual parabolic distribution of transverse shear stress. Zero transverse shear stress at the top and bottom of the plate is enforced to compute higher-order unknowns. C0 FE model makes it commercially viable. Stochastic FE analysis done with Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) FORTRAN inhouse code, selection of design points using a random variable framework, and soft computing with MARS, ANN-PSO, GPR, and ANFIS is implemented using MATLAB in-house code. Following the random variable frame, design points were selected from the input data generated through Monte Carlo Simulation. A total of four-mode shapes are analyzed in the present study. The comparison study was done to compare present work with results in the literature and they were found in good agreement. The stochastic parameters are Young’s elastic modulus, shear modulus, and the Poisson ratio. Lognormal distribution of properties is assumed in the present work. The current soft computation models shrink the number of trials and were found computationally efficient as the MCS-based FE modelling. The paper presents a comparison of MARS, ANN-PSO, GPR, and ANFIS algorithm performance with the stochastic FE model based on TSDT.},

ABSTRACT = {The behaviour of many materials is strongly influenced by the mechanical properties of hard phases, present either from deliberate introduction for reinforcement or as deleterious precipitates. While it is, therefore, self-evident that these phases should be studied, the ability to do so—particularly their plasticity—is hindered by their small sizes and lack of bulk ductility at room temperature. Many researchers have, therefore, turned to small-scale testing in order to suppress brittle fracture and study the deformation mechanisms of complex crystal structures. To characterise the plasticity of a hard and potentially anisotropic crystal, several steps and different nanomechanical testing techniques are involved, in particular nanoindentation and microcompression. The mechanical data can only be interpreted based on imaging and orientation measurements by electron microscopy. Here, we provide a tutorial to guide the collection, analysis, and interpretation of data on plasticity in hard crystals. We provide code collated in our group to help new researchers to analyse their data efficiently from the start. As part of the tutorial, we show how the slip systems and deformation mechanisms in intermetallics such as the Fe7Mo6 μ-phase are discovered, where the large and complex crystal structure precludes determining a priori even the slip planes in these phases. By comparison with other works in the literature, we also aim to identify “best practises” for researchers throughout to aid in the application of the methods to other materials systems.},

ABSTRACT = {Although the growth rate of diamond increased with increasing methane concentration at the filament temperature of 2100 °C during a hot filament chemical vapor deposition (HFCVD), it decreased with increasing methane concentration from 1% CH4 –99% H2 to 3% CH4 –97% H2 at 1900 °C. We investigated this unusual dependence of the growth rate on the methane concentration, which might give insight into the growth mechanism of a diamond. One possibility would be that the high methane concentration increases the non-diamond phase, which is then etched faster by atomic hydrogen, resulting in a decrease in the growth rate with increasing methane concentration. At 3% CH4 –97% H2, the graphite was coated on the hot filament both at 1900 °C and 2100 °C. The graphite coating on the filament decreased the number of electrons emitted from the hot filament. The electron emission at 3% CH4 –97% H2 was 13 times less than that at 1% CH4 –99% H2 at the filament temperature of 1900 °C. The lower number of electrons at 3% CH4 –97% H2 was attributed to the formation of the non-diamond phase, which etched faster than diamond, resulting in a lower growth rate.},

ABSTRACT = {The current work centers on multi-scale approaches to simulate and predict metallic nano-layers’ thermomechanical responses in crystal plasticity large deformation finite element platforms. The study is divided into two major scales: nano- and homogenized levels where Cu/Nb nano-layers are designated as case studies. At the nano-scale, a size-dependent constitutive model based on entropic kinetics is developed. A deep-learning adaptive boosting technique named single layer calibration is established to acquire associated constitutive parameters through a single process applicable to a broad range of setups entirely different from those of the calibration. The model is validated through experimental data with solid agreement followed by the behavioral predictions of multiple cases regarding size, loading pattern, layer type, and geometrical combination effects for which the performances are discussed. At the homogenized scale, founded on statistical analyses of microcanonical ensembles, a homogenized crystal plasticity-based constitutive model is developed with the aim of expediting while retaining the accuracy of computational processes. Accordingly, effective constitutive functionals are realized where the associated constants are obtained via metaheuristic genetic algorithms. The model is favorably verified with nano-scale data while accelerating the computational processes by several orders of magnitude. Ultimately, a temperature-dependent homogenized constitutive model is developed where the effective constitutive functionals along with the associated constants are determined. The model is validated by experimental data with which multiple demonstrations of temperature effects are assessed and analyzed.},

ABSTRACT = {Nonlinear finite element (FE) analysis of reinforced concrete (RC) structures is characterized by numerous modeling options and input parameters. To accurately model the nonlinear RC behavior involving concrete cracking in tension and crushing in compression, practitioners make different choices regarding the critical modeling issues, e.g., defining the concrete constitutive relations, assigning the bond between the concrete and the steel reinforcement, and solving problems related to convergence difficulties and mesh sensitivities. Thus, it is imperative to review the common modeling choices critically and develop a robust modeling strategy with consistency, reliability, and comparability. This paper proposes a modeling strategy and practical recommendations for the nonlinear FE analysis of RC structures based on parametric studies of critical modeling choices. The proposed modeling strategy aims at providing reliable predictions of flexural responses of RC members with a focus on concrete cracking behavior and crushing failure, which serve as the foundation for more complex modeling cases, e.g., RC beams bonded with fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) laminates. Additionally, herein, the implementation procedure for the proposed modeling strategy is comprehensively described with a focus on the critical modeling issues for RC structures. The proposed strategy is demonstrated through FE analyses of RC beams tested in four-point bending—one RC beam as reference and one beam externally bonded with a carbon-FRP (CFRP) laminate in its soffit. The simulated results agree well with experimental measurements regarding load-deformation relationship, cracking, flexural failure due to concrete crushing, and CFRP debonding initiated by intermediate cracks. The modeling strategy and recommendations presented herein are applicable to the nonlinear FE analysis of RC structures in general.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, the dynamics of multi-dendrite concurrent growth and coarsening of an Al-15 wt.% Cu alloy was studied using a highly computationally efficient 3D phase field model and real-time synchrotron X-ray micro-tomography. High fidelity multi-dendrite simulations were achieved and the results were compared directly with the time-evolved tomography datasets to quantify the relative importance of multi-dendritic growth and coarsening. Coarsening mechanisms under different solidification conditions were further elucidated. The dominant coarsening mechanisms change from small arm melting and interdendritic groove advancement to coalescence when the solid volume fraction approaches ~0.70. Both tomography experiments and phase field simulations indicated that multi-dendrite coarsening obeys the classical Lifshitz–Slyozov–Wagner theory Rn−R0n = kc(t−t0), but with a higher constant of n = 4.3.},

ABSTRACT = {The Qinghai–Tibet Plateau is the main permafrost area in China. Concrete structures constructed on permafrost are affected by the early negative-temperature environment. In particular, the negative-temperature environment seriously affects the strength growth process and the frost resistance of concrete (FRC). Therefore, this study considered the influence of the gas content, water–binder ratio (w/b), age, and other factors on the strength variation law and FRC under −3 °C curing conditions. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) was used to analyze the pore structure of concrete before and after freeze–thaw cycles (FTCs). The results showed that the compressive strength of the concrete (CSC) under −3 °C curing was only 57.8–86.4% of that cured under standard conditions. The CSC under −3 °C curing showed an obvious age-lag phenomenon. The FRC under −3 °C curing was much lower than that under standard curing. The porosity of the concrete under −3 °C curing was greater, with a higher percentage of harmful and multi-harmful pores than that under standard curing. The concrete properties deteriorated primarily because curing at −3 °C hindered the hydration reaction compared with standard methods. This hindrance resulted in diminished hydration development, weakening the concrete’s structural integrity. Under both curing conditions, when the gas content was between 3.2% and 3.8%, the frost resistance was the best. This is because a gas content within this range effectively enhances the internal pore structure, therefore relieving the swelling pressure caused by FTCs. Based on the freeze–thaw damage (FTD) model proposed by previous authors, a new model for the CSC under −3 °C curing reaching that of the concrete under standard curing for 28 d was established in this study. This advanced model was capable of accurately assessing the FTD of concrete structures in permafrost regions. Finally, the life expectancy of concrete in Northwest China was predicted. The life of the concrete reached 46.9 years under standard curing, while the longest life of the concrete under −3 °C curing was only 12.9 years. Therefore, attention should be paid to constructing and curing concrete structures in cold environments.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper presents a new anisotropic visco-hyperelastic constitutive model for finite bending of an incompressible rectangular elastomeric material. The proposed approach is based on the Mooney–Rivlin anisotropic strain energy function and non-linear visco-hyperelastic method. In this study, we aim to examine the mechanical response of a reinforced viscoelastic rectangular bar with a group of fibers under bending. Anisotropic materials are typically composed of one (or more) family of reinforcing fibers embedded within a soft matrix material. This operation may lead to an enhancement in the strength and stiffness of soft materials. In addition, a finite element simulation is carried out to validate the accuracy of the analytical solution. In this research, the well-known stress relaxation test, as well as the multi-step relaxation test, are examined both analytically and numerically. The results obtained from the analytical solution are found to be in good agreement with those from the finite element method. Therefore, it can be deduced that the proposed model is competent in describing the mechanical behavior of fiber-reinforced materials when subjected to finite bending deformations.},

ABSTRACT = {Polymer composites, hailed for their ultra-strength and lightweight attributes, stand out as promising materials for the upcoming era of space vehicles. The selection of the polymer matrix plays a pivotal role in material design, given its significant impact on bulk-level properties through the reinforcement/polymer interface. To aid in the systematic design of such composite systems, molecular-level calculations are employed to establish the relationship between interfacial characteristics and mechanical response, specifically stiffness. This study focuses on the interaction of fluorinated and non-fluorinated cyanate ester monomers with graphene or a BN monolayer, representing non-polymerized ester composites. Utilizing micromechanics and the density functional theory method to analyze interaction energy, charge density, and stiffness, our findings reveal that the fluorinated cyanate-ester monomer demonstrates lower interaction energy, reduced pull-apart force, and a higher separation point compared to the non-fluorinated counterpart. This behavior is attributed to the steric hindrance caused by fluorine atoms. Furthermore, the BN monolayer exhibits enhanced transverse stiffness due to increased interfacial strength, stemming from the polar nature of B–N bonds on the surface, as opposed to the C-C bonds of graphene. These molecular-level results are intended to inform the design of next-generation composites incorporating cyanate esters, specifically for structural applications.},

ABSTRACT = {The abnormal grain growth of steel, which is occurs during carburization, adversely affects properties such as heat treatment deformation and fatigue strength. This study aimed to control abnormal grain growth by controlling the materials and processes. Thus, it was necessary to investigate the effects of microstructure, precipitation, and heat treatment conditions on abnormal grain growth. We simulated abnormal grain growth using the cellular automaton (CA) method. The simulations focused on the grain boundary anisotropy and dispersion of precipitates. We considered the effect of grain boundary misorientation on boundary energy and mobility. The dispersion state of the precipitates and its pinning effect were considered, and grain growth simulations were performed. The results showed that the CA simulation reproduced abnormal grain growth by emphasizing the grain boundary mobility and the influence of the dispersion state of the precipitate on the occurrence of abnormal grain growth. The study findings show that the CA method is a potential technique for the prediction of abnormal grain growth.},

ABSTRACT = {Stainless steel is a cold-work-hardened material. The degree and mechanism of hardening depend on the grade and family of the steel. This characteristic has a direct effect on the mechanical behaviour of stainless steel when it is cold-formed. Since cold rolling is one of the most widespread processes for manufacturing flat stainless steel products, the prediction of their strain-hardening mechanical properties is of great importance to materials engineering. This work uses artificial neural networks (ANNs) to forecast the mechanical properties of the stainless steel as a function of the chemical composition and the applied cold thickness reduction. Multiple linear regression (MLR) is also used as a benchmark model. To achieve this, both traditional and new-generation austenitic, ferritic, and duplex stainless steel sheets are cold-rolled at a laboratory scale with different thickness reductions after the industrial intermediate annealing stage. Subsequently, the mechanical properties of the cold-rolled sheets are determined by tensile tests, and the experimental cold-rolling curves are drawn based on those results. A database is created from these curves to generate a model applying machine learning techniques to predict the values of the tensile strength (Rm), yield strength (Rp), hardness (H), and elongation (A) based on the chemical composition and the applied cold thickness reduction. These models can be used as supporting tools for designing and developing new stainless steel grades and/or adjusting cold-forming processes.},

ABSTRACT = {Interatomic potentials play a crucial role in the molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of silicon carbide (SiC). However, the ability of interatomic potentials to accurately describe certain physical properties of SiC has yet to be confirmed, particularly for hexagonal SiC. In this study, the mechanical, thermal, and defect properties of four SiC structures (3C-, 2H-, 4H-, and 6H-SiC) have been calculated with multiple interatomic potentials using the MD method, and then compared with the results obtained from density functional theory and experiments to assess the descriptive capabilities of these interatomic potentials. The results indicate that the T05 potential is suitable for describing the elastic constant and modulus of SiC. Thermal calculations show that the Vashishta, environment-dependent interatomic potential (EDIP), and modified embedded atom method (MEAM) potentials effectively describe the vibrational properties of SiC, and the T90 potential provides a better description of the thermal conductivity of SiC. The EDIP potential has a significant advantage in describing point defect formation energy in hexagonal SiC, and the GW potential is suitable for describing vacancy migration in hexagonal SiC. Furthermore, the T90 and T94 potentials can effectively predict the surface energies of the three low-index surfaces of 3C-SiC, and the Vashishta potential exhibits excellent capabilities in describing stacking fault properties in SiC. This work will be helpful for selecting a potential for SiC simulations.},

ABSTRACT = {Structures made of heterogeneous materials, such as composites, often require a multiscale approach when their behavior is simulated using the finite element method. By solving the boundary value problem of the macroscale model, for previously homogenized material properties, the resulting stress maps can be obtained. However, such stress results do not describe the actual behavior of the material and are often significantly different from the actual stresses in the heterogeneous microstructure. Finding high-accuracy stress results for such materials leads to time-consuming analyses in both scales. This paper focuses on the application of machine learning to multiscale analysis of structures made of composite materials, to substantially decrease the time of computations of such localization problems. The presented methodology was validated by a numerical example where a structure made of resin epoxy with randomly distributed short glass fibers was analyzed using a computational multiscale approach. Carefully prepared training data allowed artificial neural networks to learn relationships between two scales and significantly increased the efficiency of the multiscale approach.},

ABSTRACT = {The Ti-6Al-4V (TC4) alloy wheel hub has exhibited some defects that affect the properties during the vertical centrifugal casting process. Therefore, the analysis of the solidification process would contribute to solving the above-mentioned problems. In this study, an orthogonal experimental design was employed to optimize the process parameters (rotational speed, mold preheating temperature, and pouring temperature) of the vertical centrifugal casting method. The effects of process parameters on the velocity field, temperature field, and total shrinkage porosity during the solidification process were explored, and the microstructure and mechanical properties of the wheel hub prepared by the vertical centrifugal casting method were also investigated. The results showed that the rotational speed mainly induced the change of the velocity field. The pouring temperature and mold preheating temperature affected the temperature field and solidification time. Based on the analysis of the orthogonal experiment, the optimal parameters were confirmed as a rotational speed of 225 rpm, mold preheating temperature of 400 °C, and pouring temperature of 1750 °C, respectively. The simulation results of total shrinkage porosity were in agreement with the experiment results. The wheel hub was composed of nonuniform α and β phases. The lath α phase precipitated from larger β grains with different orientations. Compared with the other samples at different locations, the α phase in the PM sample (middle of the TC4 wheel hub) displayed high peak intensity and uniformly distributed β phase along the radial direction of the wheel hub. Moreover, the PM sample revealed a higher tensile strength of 820 MPa and similar Vickers hardness of 318 HV compared with the other samples at different locations, which were higher than those of rolling and extrusion molding. This experiment design would provide a good reference for the vertical centrifugal casting of the TC4 alloy.},

ABSTRACT = {The aim of this study is to solve a practical problem encountered in the automotive industry, especially the failure of a cracked lower control arm made of al 6062 T6 material during static and crash physical tests, and to characterize the behavior of cracked parts made of aluminum materials using the fracture mechanics parameters. As a first step, we carried out a numerical study and simulation using Abaqus/CAE 2020 software and the finite element method to determine the stress concentration and load limit capacity for different car weight cases. The von Mises stress variation shows crack initiation and propagation to be in the area of the lower control arm’s attachment to the vehicle platform, where stress is concentrated. These numerical results are consistent with the experimental test results found by automotive manufacturers. Also, we find that the mechanical load that can support this part is below 4900 N for good performance. In the second step, we use the results of the first section to simulate the failure of a lower control arm with a crack defect. This paper investigates the stress intensity factor KI in mode I for different lengths (L) and depths (a) of the crack in the lower control arm using the extended finite element method (XFEM) under Abaqus/CAE. For crack failure initiation and progression, we relied on the traction separation law, specifically the maximum principal stress (MAXPS) criterion. The KI factor was evaluated for the materials steel and Al 6062 T6. The results obtained from the variation of the KI coefficient as a function of crack depth (a) and the thickness (t) show that the crack remains stable even when a depth ratio (a/t = 0.8) is reached for the steel material. However, the crack in the Aluminum 6062 T6 material becomes unstable at depth (a/t = 0.6), with a high risk of total failure of the lower control arm.},

ABSTRACT = {The mechanical properties of a defect-free laser melting (PBF-LB) deposit of an AISI 316L steel alloy were assessed by means of an instrumented indentation test (IIT), at both the macro- and nano-scales. The inherent non-equilibrium microstructure of the alloy was chemically homogenous and consisted of equiaxed grains and large-elongated grains (under the optical microscope) with irregular outlines composed of a much finer internal cell structure (under the scanning electron microscope). Berkovich and Vickers indenters were used to assess the indentation properties across individual grains (nano) and over multiple grains (macro), respectively. The nano-indentation over the X-Y plane revealed nearly constant indentation modulus across an individual grain but variable on average within different grains whose value depended on the relative orientation of the individual grain. The macro-indentation test was conducted to analyze the tensile-like properties of the polycrystalline SS 316L alloy over the X-Y and Y-Z planes. The macro-indentation test provided a reliable estimate of the ultimate tensile strength (UTS-like) of the alloy. Other indentation properties gave inconsistent results, and a post factum analysis was, therefore, conducted, by means of a new approach, to account for the presence of residual stresses. The already existing indentation data were supplemented with new repeated indentation tests to conduct a detailed analysis of the relaxation ability of compressive and tensile residual stresses. The developed methodology allows the effect of residual stresses and the reliability of measured macro-indentation properties to be examined as a function of a small group of indentation parameters.},

ABSTRACT = {The manufacturing processes and design of metal and alloy products can be performed over a wide range of strain rates and temperatures. To design and optimize these processes using computational mechanics tools, the selection and calibration of the constitutive models is critical. In the case of hazardous and explosive impact loads, it is not always possible to test material properties. For this purpose, this paper assesses the efficiency and the accuracy of different architectures of ANNs for the identification of the Johnson–Cook material model parameters. The implemented computational tool of an ANN-based parameter identification strategy provides adequate results in a range of strain rates required for general manufacturing and product design applications. Four ANN architectures are studied to find the most suitable configuration for a reduced amount of experimental data, particularly for cases where high-impact testing is constrained. The different ANN structures are evaluated based on the model’s predictive capability, revealing that the perceptron-based network of 66 inputs and one hidden layer of 30 neurons provides the highest prediction accuracy of the effective flow stress–strain behavior of Ti64 alloy and three virtual materials.},

ABSTRACT = {This study aims to enhance the productivity of high-voltage transmission line insulators and their operational safety by investigating their failure mechanisms under ultimate load conditions. Destructive tests were conducted on a specific type of insulator under ultimate load conditions. A high-speed camera was used to document the insulator’s failure process and collect strain data from designated points. A simulation model of the insulator was established to predict the effects of ultimate loads. The simulation results identified a maximum first principal stress of 94.549 MPa in the porcelain shell, with stress distribution characteristics resembling a cantilever beam subjected to bending. This implied that the insulator failure occurred when the stress reached the bending strength of the porcelain shell. To validate the simulation’s accuracy, bending and tensile strength tests were conducted on the ceramic materials constituting the insulator. The bending strength of the porcelain shell was 100.52 MPa, showing a 5.6% variation from the simulation results, which indicated the reliability of the simulation model. Finally, optimization designs on the design parameters P1 and P2 of the insulator were conducted. The results indicated that setting P1 to 8° and P2 to 90.062 mm decreased the first principal stress of the porcelain shell by 47.6% and Von Mises stress by 31.6% under ultimate load conditions, significantly enhancing the load-bearing capacity. This research contributed to improving the production yield and safety performance of insulators.},

ABSTRACT = {Before a new type of engine is introduced into civil aviation, it must comply with various safety regulations. These regulations include the analysis of secondary damage caused by the re-ingestion of a tooth fragment. The purpose is to prevent crack propagation through the gear rim, which would lead to catastrophic failure. In this context, identification of the initial crack location is crucial to determine the crack propagation path. Therefore, this paper presents a technique to determine and validate a constitutive material model and fracture locus for case-hardened spur gears. As the modelling of the surface-hardened layer is computationally intensive, it is necessary to homogenise the model. This paper comprehensively reviews and discusses the associated effects and errors. To determine the plastic behaviour of the case-hardened external gear (30CrNiMo8) and the nitrided internal gear (35CrAlNi7-10), the widely acknowledged Johnson–Cook material model is implemented using compression and Vickers indenter tests to define the necessary parameters. The fracture locus implementation is also based on the Johnson–Cook method and an axial shift of the fracture locus based on the hardness profile of the spur gears is determined by quasi-static pulsator tests. For validation, a project-specific gearbox test rig is used, enabling consistent ingestion of defined fragments. In addition, to check the likelihood of a tooth flank crack and to validate the results, a simplified ingestion experiment is performed.},

ABSTRACT = {This work presents a test rig developed for testing the lifetime of electrically and cyclically activated shape memory alloy wires. This test rig is developed to provide information on the functional and structural fatigue of the wires. Therefore, electrical activation on the test rig can be carried out using different activation profiles, because it is of great research interest to determine whether those profiles have a significant influence on the wire’s lifetime and functional behavior. The test rig monitors the process parameters such as stroke, current, voltage, and force. After presenting the electrical and mechanical design of the test rig, this publication evaluates an initial series of tests to demonstrate its functionality. Three different activation profiles are run in parallel on four identical test rig setups and are then evaluated. The functionality of the test rig is verified by a detailed evaluation of the process data on the one hand, and by comparing the results with existing literature on the other. The functionality of the test rig can thus be verified. At the same time, the strong influence of the different activation profiles on both the lifetime and the functional properties of the shape memory alloy wires becomes clear.},
