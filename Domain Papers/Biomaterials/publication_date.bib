ABSTRACT = {This review aimed at searching literature for data regarding the inflammasomes’ involvement in the pathogenesis of oral diseases (mainly periodontitis) and general pathologies, including approaches to control inflammasome-related pathogenic mechanisms. The inflammasomes are part of the innate immune response that activates inflammatory caspases by canonical and noncanonical pathways, to control the activity of Gasdermin D. Once an inflammasome is activated, pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukins, are released. Thus, inflammasomes are involved in inflammatory, autoimmune and autoinflammatory diseases. The review also investigated novel therapies based on the use of phytochemicals and pharmaceutical substances for inhibiting inflammasome activity. Pharmaceutical substances can control the inflammasomes by three mechanisms: inhibiting the intracellular signaling pathways (Allopurinol and SS-31), blocking inflammasome components (VX-765, Emricasan and VX-740), and inhibiting cytokines mediated by the inflammasomes (Canakinumab, Anakinra and Rilonacept). Moreover, phytochemicals inhibit the inflammasomes by neutralizing reactive oxygen species. Biomaterials functionalized by the adsorption of therapeutic agents onto different nanomaterials could represent future research directions to facilitate multimodal and sequential treatment in oral pathologies.},

ABSTRACT = {The integration of functional biomaterials in oculoplastic and orbital surgery is a pivotal area where material science and clinical practice converge. This review, encompassing primary research from 2015 to 2023, delves into the use of biomaterials in two key areas: the reconstruction of orbital floor fractures and the development of implants and prostheses for anophthalmic sockets post-eye removal. The discussion begins with an analysis of orbital floor injuries, including their pathophysiology and treatment modalities. It is noted that titanium mesh remains the gold standard for orbital floor repair due to its effectiveness. The review then examines the array of materials used for orbital implants and prostheses, highlighting the dependence on surgeon preference and experience, as there are currently no definitive guidelines. While recent innovations in biomaterials show promise, the review underscores the need for more clinical data before these new materials can be widely adopted in clinical settings. The review advocates for an interdisciplinary approach in orbital surgery, emphasizing patient-centered care and the potential of biomaterials to significantly enhance patient outcomes.},

ABSTRACT = {Besides the need for biomaterial surface modification to improve cellular attachment, laser-structuring is favorable for designing a new surface topography for external bone fixator pins or implants. The principle of this study was to observe how bioinspired (deer antler) laser-induced nano–microstructures influenced the adhesion and growth of skin cells. The goal was to create pins that allow the skin to attach to the biomaterial surface in a bacteria-proof manner. Therefore, typical fixator metals, steel, and titanium alloy were structured using ultrashort laser pulses, which resulted in periodical nano- and microstructures. Surface characteristics were investigated using a laser scanning microscope and static water contact angle measurements. In vitro studies with human HaCaT keratinocytes focused on cell adhesion, morphology, actin formation, and growth within 7 days. The study showed that surface functionalization influenced cell attachment, spreading, and proliferation. Micro-dimple clusters on polished bulk metals (DC20) will not hinder viability. Still, they will not promote the initial adhesion and spreading of HaCaTs. In contrast, additional nanostructuring with laser-induced periodic surface structures (LIPSS) promotes cell behavior. DC20 + LIPSS induced enhanced cell attachment with well-spread cell morphology. Thus, the bioinspired structures exhibited a benefit in initial cell adhesion. Laser surface functionalization opens up new possibilities for structuring, and is relevant to developing bioactive implants in regenerative medicine.},

ABSTRACT = {Multifunctional nanoparticles are of significant importance for synergistic multimodal antitumor activity. Herein, zinc oxide (ZnO) was used as pH-sensitive nanoparticles for loading the chemotherapy agent doxorubicin (DOX) and the photosensitizer agent indocyanine green (ICG), and biocompatible low-molecular-weight heparin (LMHP) was used as the gatekeepers for synergistic photothermal therapy/photodynamic therapy/chemotherapy/immunotherapy. ZnO was decomposed into cytotoxic Zn2+ ions, leading to a tumor-specific release of ICG and DOX. ZnO simultaneously produced oxygen (O2) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) for photodynamic therapy (PDT). The released ICG under laser irradiation produced ROS for PDT and raised the tumor temperature for photothermal therapy (PTT). The released DOX directly caused tumor cell death for chemotherapy. Both DOX and ICG also induced immunogenic cell death (ICD) for immunotherapy. The in vivo and in vitro results presented a superior inhibition of tumor progression, metastasis and recurrence. Therefore, this study could provide an efficient approach for designing multifunctional nanoparticles for synergistic multimodal antitumor therapy.},

ABSTRACT = {The field of bone tissue engineering is steadily being improved by novel experimental approaches. Nevertheless, microbial adhesion after scaffold implantation remains a limitation that could lead to the impairment of the regeneration process, or scaffold rejection. The present study introduces a methodology that employs laser-based strategies for the development of antimicrobial interfaces on tricalcium phosphate–hydroxyapatite (TCP-HA) scaffolds. The outer surfaces of the ceramic scaffolds with inner porosity were structured using a femtosecond laser (λ = 800 nm; τ = 70 fs) for developing micropatterns and altering local surface roughness. The pulsed laser deposition of ZnO was used for the subsequent functionalization of both laser-structured and unmodified surfaces. The impact of the fs irradiation was investigated by Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. The effects of the ZnO-layered ceramic surfaces on initial bacterial adherence were assessed by culturing Staphylococcus aureus on both functionalized and non-functionalized scaffolds. Bacterial metabolic activity and morphology were monitored via the Resazurin assay and microscopic approaches. The presence of ZnO evidently decreased the metabolic activity of bacteria and led to impaired cell morphology. The results from this study have led to the conclusion that the combination of fs laser-structured surface topography and ZnO could yield a potential antimicrobial interface for implants in bone tissue engineering.},

ABSTRACT = {Since chondrocytes are highly vulnerable to oxidative stress, an anti-oxidative bioink combined with 3D bioprinting may facilitate its applications in cartilage tissue engineering. We developed an anti-oxidative bioink with methacrylate-modified rutin (RTMA) as an additional bioactive component and glycidyl methacrylate silk fibroin as a biomaterial component. Bioink containing 0% RTMA was used as the control sample. Compared with hydrogel samples produced with the control bioink, solidified anti-oxidative bioinks displayed a similar porous microstructure, which is suitable for cell adhesion and migration, and the transportation of nutrients and wastes. Among photo-cured samples prepared with anti-oxidative bioinks and the control bioink, the sample containing 1 mg/mL of RTMA (RTMA-1) showed good degradation, promising mechanical properties, and the best cytocompatibility, and it was selected for further investigation. Based on the results of 3D bioprinting tests, the RTMA-1 bioink exhibited good printability and high shape fidelity. The results demonstrated that RTMA-1 reduced intracellular oxidative stress in encapsulated chondrocytes under H2O2 stimulation, which results from upregulation of COLII and AGG and downregulation of MMP13 and MMP1. By using in vitro and in vivo tests, our data suggest that the RTMA-1 bioink significantly enhanced the regeneration and maturation of cartilage tissue compared to the control bioink, indicating that this anti-oxidative bioink can be used for 3D bioprinting and cartilage tissue engineering applications in the future.},

ABSTRACT = {Additive manufacturing (AM) of orthopedic implants has increased in recent years, providing benefits to surgeons, patients, and implant companies. Both traditional and new titanium alloys are under consideration for AM-manufactured implants. However, concerns remain about their wear and corrosion (tribocorrosion) performance. In this study, the effects of fretting corrosion were investigated on AM Ti-29Nb-21Zr (pre-alloyed and admixed) and AM Ti-6Al-4V with 1% nano yttria-stabilized zirconia (nYSZ). Low cycle (100 cycles, 3 Hz, 100 mN) fretting and fretting corrosion (potentiostatic, 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl) methods were used to compare these AM alloys to traditionally manufactured AM Ti-6Al-4V. Alloy and admixture surfaces were subjected to (1) fretting in the air (i.e., small-scale reciprocal sliding) and (2) fretting corrosion in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) using a single diamond asperity (17 µm radius). Wear track depth measurements, fretting currents and scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM/EDS) analysis of oxide debris revealed that pre-alloyed AM Ti-29Nb-21Zr generally had greater wear depths after 100 cycles (4.67 +/− 0.55 µm dry and 5.78 +/− 0.83 µm in solution) and higher fretting currents (0.58 +/− 0.07 µA). A correlation (R2 = 0.67) was found between wear depth and the average fretting currents with different alloys located in different regions of the relationship. No statistically significant differences were observed in wear depth between in-air and in-PBS tests. However, significantly higher amounts of oxygen (measured by oxygen weight % by EDS analysis of the debris) were embedded within the wear track for tests performed in PBS compared to air for all samples except the ad-mixed Ti-29Nb-21Zr (p = 0.21). For traditional and AM Ti-6Al-4V, the wear track depths (dry fretting: 2.90 +/− 0.32 µm vs. 2.51 +/− 0.51 μm, respectively; fretting corrosion: 2.09 +/− 0.59 μm vs. 1.16 +/− 0.79 μm, respectively) and fretting current measurements (0.37 +/− 0.05 μA vs. 0.34 +/− 0.05 μA, respectively) showed no significant differences. The dominant wear deformation process was plastic deformation followed by cyclic extrusion of plate-like wear debris at the end of the stroke, resulting in ribbon-like extruded material for all alloys. While previous work documented improved corrosion resistance of Ti-29Nb-21Zr in simulated inflammatory solutions over Ti-6Al-4V, this work does not show similar improvements in the relative fretting corrosion resistance of these alloys compared to Ti-6Al-4V.},

ABSTRACT = {The regenerative capacity of well-preserved blood clots may be enhanced by biologics like enamel matrix derivative (EMD). This retrospective analysis compares outcomes reported by three centers using different heterografts. Center 1 (C1) treated intrabony defects combining cross-linked high-molecular-weight hyaluronic acid (xHyA) with a xenograft; center 2 (C2) used EMD with an allograft combination to graft a residual pocket. Center 3 (C3) combined xHyA with the placement of a resorbable polymer membrane for defect cover. Clinical parameters, BoP reduction, and radiographically observed defect fill at 12-month examination are reported. The 12-month evaluation yielded significant improvements in PPD and CAL at each center (p < 0.001, respectively). Analyses of Covariance revealed significant improvements in all parameters, and a significantly greater CAL gain was revealed for C2 vs. C1 (p = 0.006). Radiographic defect fill presented significantly higher scores for C2 and C3 vs. C1 (p = 0.003 and = 0.014; C2 vs. C3 p = 1.00). Gingival recession increased in C1 and C3 (p = 1.00), while C2 reported no GR after 12 months (C2:C1 p = 0.002; C2:C3 p = 0.005). BoP tendency and pocket closure rate shared similar rates. Within the limitations of the study, a data comparison indicated that xHyA showed a similar capacity to enhance the regenerative response, as known for EMD. Radiographic follow-up underlined xHyA’s unique role in new attachment formation.},

ABSTRACT = {“Hot spot” 19F magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has garnered significant attention recently for its ability to image various disease markers quantitatively. Unlike conventional gadolinium-based MRI contrast agents, which rely on proton signal modulation, 19F-MRI’s direct detection has a unique advantage in vivo, as the human body exhibits a negligible background 19F-signal. However, existing perfluorocarbon (PFC) or PFC-based contrast materials suffer from several limitations, including low longitudinal relaxation rates and relatively low imaging efficiency. Hence, we designed a macromolecular contrast agent featuring a high number of magnetically equivalent 19F-nuclei in a single macromolecule, adequate fluorine nucleus mobility, and excellent water solubility. This design utilizes superfluorinated polyphosphazene (PPz) polymers as the 19F-source; these are modified with sodium mercaptoethanesulfonate (MESNa) to achieve water solubility exceeding 360 mg/mL, which is a similar solubility to that of sodium chloride. We observed substantial signal enhancement in MRI with these novel macromolecular carriers compared to non-enhanced surroundings and aqueous trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) used as a positive control. In conclusion, these novel water-soluble macromolecular carriers represent a promising platform for future MRI contrast agents.},

ABSTRACT = {Dentine adhesives have demonstrated great success with permanent teeth. Though the results in primary teeth are not well documented, some studies have demonstrated lower values of bond strength in primary teeth than those found in permanent teeth. The aim of this study was to compare and evaluate the effect of grape seed extract (6.5%) (Herbal Bio Solutions, Delhi, India), glutaraldehyde (5%) (Loba Chemie PVT. LTD., Mumbai), hesperidin (0.5%) (Herbal Bio Solutions, Delhi, India), and casein phosphopeptide-amorphous calcium phosphate (tooth mousse) (GC Corporation, Alsip, IL, USA) on the shear bond strength of dentine of primary teeth and to evaluate the resin tags at the resin tooth interface. Seventy-five caries-free human primary molars were collected, and their occlusal surfaces were ground flat. Dentin surfaces were etched using phosphoric acid. Then teeth were randomly assigned in sequential order to five groups according to the dentinal treatment method: Group I (Control group) (no treatment), Group II (5% glutaraldehyde), Group III (6.5% grape seed extract), Group IV (0.5% hesperidin), and Group V (CPP-ACP). Ten teeth from each group were assigned for Shear Bond Strength and five for SEM analysis. ANOVA and a post hoc least significant difference test (p < 0.05) were used for statistical analysis of the collected data. The grape seed extract group showed significantly increased shear bond strength than the control group (p < 0.05), and the mean length of resin tags in different dentine bio modifiers groups was also statistically significant (p < 0.05). The use of dentin bio modifiers such as 5% glutaraldehyde, 6.5% grape seed extract, 0.5% hesperidin, and CPP-ACP in the bonding process for primary teeth did not improve the dentinal bond strength.},

ABSTRACT = {Calcium phosphate (CaP) coating of zirconia and zirconia-based implants is challenging, due to their chemical instability and susceptibility to thermal and mechanical impacts. A 3 mol% yttrium-stabilized tetragonal zirconia polycrystal was subjected to femtosecond laser (FsL) irradiation to form micro- and submicron surface architectures, prior to CaP coating using pulsed laser deposition (PLD) and low-temperature solution processing. Untreated zirconia, CaP-coated zirconia, and FsL-irradiated and CaP-coated zirconia were implanted in proximal tibial metaphyses of male Japanese white rabbits for four weeks. Radiographical analysis, push-out test, alizarin red staining, and histomorphometric analysis demonstrated a much improved bone-bonding ability of FsL-irradiated and CaP-coated zirconia over CaP-coated zirconia without FsL irradiation and untreated zirconia. The failure strength of the FsL-irradiated and CaP-coated zirconia in the push−out test was 6.2–13.1-times higher than that of the CaP-coated zirconia without FsL irradiation and untreated zirconia. Moreover, the adhesion strength between the bone and FsL-irradiated and CaP-coated zirconia was as high as that inducing host bone fracture in the push-out tests. The increased bone-bonding ability was attributed to the micro-/submicron surface architectures that enhanced osteoblastic differentiation and mechanical interlocking, leading to improved osteointegration. FsL irradiation followed by CaP coating could be useful for improving the osteointegration of cement-less zirconia-based joints and zirconia dental implants.},

ABSTRACT = {Enhancing nanoparticles’ anti-cancer capabilities as drug carriers requires the careful adjustment of formulation parameters, including loading efficiency, drug/carrier ratio, and synthesis method. Small adjustments to these parameters can significantly influence the drug-loading efficiency of nanoparticles. Our study explored how chitosan and polyethylene glycol (PEG) coatings affect the structural properties, drug-loading efficiency, and anti-cancer efficacy of Fe3O4 nanoparticles (NPs). The loading efficiency of the NPs was determined using FTIR spectrometry and XRD. The quantity of chrysin incorporated into the coated NPs was examined using UV–Vis spectrometry. The effect of the NPs on cell viability and apoptosis was determined by employing the HCT 116 human colon carcinoma cell line. We showed that a two-fold increase in drug concentration did not impact the loading efficiency of Fe3O4 NPs coated with PEG. However, there was a 33 Å difference in the crystallite sizes obtained from chitosan-coated Fe3O4 NPs and drug concentrations of 1:0.5 and 1:2, resulting in decreased system stability. In conclusion, PEG coating exhibited a higher loading efficiency of Fe3O4 NPs compared to chitosan, resulting in enhanced anti-tumor effects. Furthermore, variations in the loaded amount of chrysin did not impact the crystallinity of PEG-coated NPs, emphasizing the stability and regularity of the system.},

ABSTRACT = {The additive manufacturing of titanium–niobium–tantalum alloys with nominal chemical compositions Ti–xNb–6Ta (x = 20, 27, 35) by means of laser beam powder bed fusion is reported, and their potential as implant materials is elaborated by mechanical and biological characterization. The properties of dense specimens manufactured in different build orientations and of open porous Ti–20Nb–6Ta specimens are evaluated. Compression tests indicate that strength and elasticity are influenced by the chemical composition and build orientation. The minimum elasticity is always observed in the 90° orientation. It is lowest for Ti–20Nb–6Ta (43.2 ± 2.7 GPa) and can be further reduced to 8.1 ± 1.0 GPa for open porous specimens (p < 0.001). Furthermore, human osteoblasts are cultivated for 7 and 14 days on as-printed specimens and their biological response is compared to that of Ti–6Al–4V. Build orientation and cultivation time significantly affect the gene expression profile of osteogenic differentiation markers. Incomplete cell spreading is observed in specimens manufactured in 0° build orientation, whereas widely stretched cells are observed in 90° build orientation, i.e., parallel to the build direction. Compared to Ti–6Al–4V, Ti–Nb–Ta specimens promote improved osteogenesis and reduce the induction of inflammation. Accordingly, Ti–xNb–6Ta alloys have favorable mechanical and biological properties with great potential for application in orthopedic implants.},

ABSTRACT = {The configuration of implant-supported prostheses is considered to influence the magnitude of stress concentrations, affecting their survival rate. The purpose of this study is to determine, through strain gauge measurements during load application, the dispersion and magnitude of strain concentrations in different implant-supported prosthesis designs. All designs matched those commonly used in posterior partially edentulous states. Three implants were inserted into an epoxy resin model (PLM-4B Vishay Measurements Group Inc., Raleigh, NC, USA), allowing for the delivery of three- and four-unit crowns in different cemented configurations. Loads were applied at vertical and oblique directions over the cast crowns in six different configurations representing various posterior partially edentulous restorations. The readings from the strain gauges adhered to the implant necks’ presented data on implant strain. Prostheses including cantilevers showed the highest strain among the three-unit prostheses within the prosthetic complex, and three single units showed the least (8133 µs vs. 201 µs, respectively). Angulated load application also had a role in amplifying the strains recorded, resulting in total strains of between 3.5 and 20 times higher than during vertical loading in all configurations. It can be concluded that the configuration of implant-fixed partial prosthesis changes the loads engaging the restoration, the implant, and, probably, the supporting bone.},

ABSTRACT = {Human platelet lysate (HPL), rich in growth factors, is increasingly recognized for its potential in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. However, its use in liquid or gel form is constrained by limited stability and handling difficulties. This study aimed to develop dry and porous aerogels from HPL hydrogel using an environmentally friendly supercritical CO2-based shaping process, specifically tailored for tissue engineering applications. The aerogels produced retained their three-dimensional structure and demonstrated significant mechanical robustness and enhanced manageability. Impressively, they exhibited high water absorption capacity, absorbing 87% of their weight in water within 120 min. Furthermore, the growth factors released by these aerogels showed a sustained and favourable biological response in vitro. They maintained the cellular metabolic activity of fibroblasts (BALB-3T3) at levels akin to conventional culture conditions, even after prolonged storage, and facilitated the migration of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Additionally, the aerogels themselves supported the adhesion and proliferation of murine fibroblasts (BALB-3T3). Beyond serving as excellent matrices for cell culture, these aerogels function as efficient systems for the delivery of growth factors. Their multifunctional capabilities position them as promising candidates for various tissue regeneration strategies. Importantly, the developed aerogels can be stored conveniently and are considered ready to use, enhancing their practicality and applicability in regenerative medicine.},

ABSTRACT = {Nanoporous membranes (NPMBs) have been the focus of interest of many scientists in the last decade. However, the fouling phenomenon that takes place during the implantation period blocks pores and causes failure in the local implant. In this study, alumina NPMBs were developed using electrochemical anodization through two steps. Furthermore, graphene oxide (GO), free and impregnated with ZIF-8 MOF, was synthesized and loaded in a mixture of PVDF/PVP polymer matrix at different ratios, and was applied to the produced NPMBs using spin-coater. The NPMBs were characterized before and after coating by SEM/EDX, TEM, FTIR, XRD, contact angle and AFM. The antifouling features of the NPMBs were analyzed against two different bacterial species. The prepared alumina NPMBs demonstrated homogeneous porous structures with pore sizes ranging from 36 to 39 nm. The coated layers were proven to possess microporous coatings on the surfaces of the NPMBs. The numbers of released ions (Al and Zn) from the coated NPMBs were below the allowed limits. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) uptake in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) was impressively reduced with the presence of coating materials. In addition, the antifouling behavior of the coated NPMBs against the selected strains of bacteria was greatly enhanced compared with the pure alumina NPMBs. Finally, NPMBs’ uncoated and polymer-coated membranes were tested for their ability to deliver donepezil HCl. The results reveal the downregulation of donepezil release, especially from NPMBs coated with PVDF/PVP 0.5GO. It is advised to use the current antifouling materials and techniques to overcome the limitations of the inorganic NPMBs implants.},

ABSTRACT = {Zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) are metal oxide nanomaterials, which are important for several applications: antibacterial, anthelmintic, antiprotozoal and antitumoral, among others. These applications are mainly related to the ability to spontaneously produce and induce the production of reactive oxygen species that are important components for the destruction of pathogens and tumor cells. While trying to potentiate ZnO NPs, studies have associated these NPs with silver oxide (AgO) or silver (Ag) NPs. It has already been reported that this combination (Ag-ZnO/AgO NPs) is able to enhance the microbicidal potential. Although possessing much potential for several purposes, it is important to evaluate whether this association also poses the risk of toxicity to cells and experimental models. Therefore, this work aimed to evaluate the toxicity of various Ag-ZnO/AgO NP nanocomposites, in vitro and in vivo. Accordingly, ZnO nanocrystals and nanocomposites with various concentrations of AgO (ZnO:5Ag, ZnO:9Ag or ZnO:11Ag) were used in different cytotoxicity models: Galleria mellonella (G. mellonella), cell lines (VERO and RAW 264.7) and C57BL/6 mice. In the G. mellonella model, four concentrations were used in a single dose, with subsequent evaluation of mortality. In the case of cells, serial concentrations starting at 125 µg/mL were used, with subsequent cytotoxicity assessment. Based on the safe doses obtained in G. mellonella and cell models, the best doses were used in mice, with subsequent evaluations of weight, biochemistry as also renal and liver histopathology. It was observed that the toxicity, although low, of the nanocomposites was dependent upon the concentration of AgO used in association with ZnO NPs, both in vitro and in vivo.},

ABSTRACT = {Titanium-based materials are the most widely used materials in biomedical applications. However, according to literature findings, the degradation products of titanium have been associated with potential allergic reactions, inflammation, and bone resorption. The corrosion process of Ti-6Al-4V in the human body environment may be exacerbated by factors such as reduced pH levels and elevated concentrations of chloride compounds. Coatings made of biopolymers are gaining attention as they offer numerous advantages for enhancing implant functionality, including improved biocompatibility, bioactivity, wettability, drug release, and antibacterial activity. This study analyzes the physicochemical and electrochemical behavior of the Ti-6Al-4V ELI alloy subjected to PCL and PCL/TiO2 deposition by the electrospinning method. To characterize the polymer-based layer, tests of chemical and phase composition, as well as surface morphology investigations, were performed. Wetting angle tests were conducted as part of assessing the physicochemical properties. The samples were subjected to corrosion behavior analysis, which included open circuit potential measurements, potentiodynamic tests, and the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy method. Additionally, the quantification of released ions post the potentiodynamic test was carried out using the inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP–AES) method. Cytotoxicity tests were also performed. It was found that surface modification by depositing a polymer-based layer on the titanium substrate material using the electrospinning method provides improved corrosion behavior, and the samples exhibit non-toxic properties.},

ABSTRACT = {Podophyllotoxin (PPT) is used in the industrial production of efficient anticancer, antiviral and other drugs. Sinopodophyllum hexandrum or Podophyllum peltatum are natural sources of PPT, but at present they are considered as endangered species. Their PPT content is variable, depending on the growing conditions. Searching for new sources of PPT, some representatives of the genus Juniperus were found to exhibit efficient PPT biosynthesis. However, PPT is highly toxic and poorly soluble in water compound, which limits its clinical applications. In this connection, amphiphilic polymer micelles are considered to be suitable PPT carriers, aimed at increase in water solubility and decrease in toxicity. The present research deals with the evaluation of MPEG–polycarbonate block copolymer micelles loaded with PPT or juniper extracts. The active component-loaded polymer nanocarriers were characterized by dynamic and electrophoretic light scattering, as well as by transmission electron microscopy. The active component loading efficiency and loading capacity were also determined. Highly efficient antiproliferative activity of the loaded micelles was determined in a panel of cancer cell lines. The obtained amphiphilic nanocarriers, loaded with PPT-containing bioactive components, have application in future in vivo preclinical trials of their pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as potential therapeutical agents in the prospective nanomedicine.},

ABSTRACT = {Bio-Gide® is a collagen membrane routinely used in guided bone regeneration. Recent studies have shown that this collagen membrane has osteoconductive properties, meaning that it can support the growth of new bone. However, it has also been observed that the collagen membrane has areas of mineralized fibers which can occur spontaneously and independently of osteoblasts. To better understand how this works, we established a model using minced collagen membranes to reduce the active mineralization of intact collagen membranes in favor of passive mineralization. We thus compared the original intact membrane with a minced collagen membrane in a 5 mm calvarial defect model in Sprague Dawley rats. After three weeks of healing, histology and microcomputed tomography (μCT) were performed. Histological analysis confirmed the osteoconductive properties, with new bone growing inside the intact collagen membrane. However, in minced collagen membranes, the osteoconductive properties were restricted to the defect margins. Interestingly, histology revealed large mineralized areas indicating passive mineralization with no signs of bone formation. In the μCT analysis, the intact collagen membranes caused a higher median mineralized volume (1.5 mm3) compared with the minced group (0.4 mm3), but this lacked significance (p = 0.09). The μCT analysis needs to be interpreted carefully, particularly in defects filled with minced membranes, considering that the mineralized tissue may not necessarily be bone but also the result of passive mineralization. Taken together, the findings suggest that Bio-Gide® collagen membranes support bone formation while also exhibiting potential for passive mineralization.},

ABSTRACT = {Bone tissue engineering using osteoconductive scaffolds holds promise for regeneration, with pearl powder gaining interest for its bioactive qualities. This study used freeze drying to create chitosan (CS) scaffolds with pearl/calcium phosphate (p/CaP) powders, mimicking bone tissue structurally and compositionally. Characterization included scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and mechanical testing. X-ray diffraction (XRD) Fourier-transform infrared–photoacoustic photo-acoustic sampling (FTIR−PAS), and FTIR- attenuated total reflectance (FTIR-ATR) were used to characterize p/CaP. In vitro tests covered degradation, cell activity, and SEM analysis. The scaffolds showed notable compressive strength and modulus enhancements with increasing p/CaP content. Porosity, ranging from 60% to 90%, decreased significantly at higher pearl/CaP ratios. Optimal cell proliferation and differentiation were observed with scaffolds containing up to 30 wt.% p/CaP, with 30 wt.% pearl powder and 30 wt.% p/CaP yielding the best results. In conclusion, pearl/calcium phosphate chitosan (p/CaP_CS) composite scaffolds emerged as promising biomaterials for bone tissue engineering, combining structural mimicry and favourable biological responses.},

ABSTRACT = {The hyoid is the only bone in the human body that is completely independent, not forming a joint with any other bone; its position is maintained by the suprahyoid and infrahyoid muscles, as well as several ligaments. The purpose of this study was to ascertain the effect of the functional pressure arising from these muscles and ligaments on the hyoid body structure from its bone mineral density, bone quality, and histological observations. The area between the mesial-most part of each lesser horn and the center of the hyoid body was divided equally into four measurement regions. We conducted histological investigations at each measurement region and observed the entheses. To analyze bone mass and bone quality, we also measured bone mineral density (BMD) and analyzed biological apatite (BAp) crystallite orientation in the same regions. Histological observations identified periosteal insertions and fibrocartilaginous entheses. There was no significant difference in BMD between any of the measurement regions, but the preferential orientation of BAp crystallites was stronger in the infrahyoid muscles and ligaments, where fibrocartilaginous entheses are found, than in other places. This suggests that the functional pressure at these sites might exert a major effect not only on the morphological characteristics of the entheses but also on bone quality.},

ABSTRACT = {Bone tissue is one of the most transplanted tissues. The ageing population and bone diseases are the main causes of the growing need for novel treatments offered by bone tissue engineering. Three-dimensional (3D) scaffolds, as artificial structures that fulfil certain characteristics, can be used as a temporary matrix for bone regeneration. In this study, we aimed to fabricate 3D porous polymer scaffolds functionalized with tricalcium phosphate (TCP) particles for applications in bone tissue regeneration. Different combinations of poly(lactic acid) (PLA), poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG with molecular weight of 600 or 2000 Da) and poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) with TCP were blended by a gel-casting method combined with rapid heating. Porous composite scaffolds with pore sizes from 100 to 1500 µm were obtained. ATR-FTIR, DSC, and wettability tests were performed to study scaffold composition, thermal properties, and hydrophilicity, respectively. The samples were observed with the use of optical and scanning electron microscopes. The addition of PCL to PLA increased the hydrophobicity of the composite scaffolds and reduced their susceptibility to degradation, whereas the addition of PEG increased the hydrophilicity and degradation rates but concomitantly resulted in enhanced creation of rounded mineral deposits. The scaffolds were not cytotoxic according to an indirect test in L929 fibroblasts, and they supported adhesion and growth of MG-63 cells when cultured in direct contact.},

ABSTRACT = {Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection caused the COVID-19 pandemic, impacting the global economy and medical system due to its fast spread and extremely high infectivity. Efficient control of the spread of the disease relies on a fast, accurate, and convenient detection system for the early screening of the infected population. Although reverse transcription–quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is the gold-standard method for SARS-CoV-2 RNA analysis, it has complex experimental procedures and relies on expensive instruments and professional operators. In this work, we proposed a simple, direct, amplification-free lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) with dual-mode detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA via direct visualization as well as fluorescence detection. The viral RNA was detected by the designed DNA probes to specifically hybridize with the conserved open reading frame 1ab (ORF1ab), envelope protein (E), and nucleocapsid (N) regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome to form DNA–RNA hybrids. These hybrids were then recognized by the dual-mode gold nanoparticles (DMNPs) to produce two different readout signals. The fluorescence characteristics of different sizes of GNPs were explored. Under the optimized conditions, the LFIA presented a linear detection range of 104–106 TU/mL with a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.76, 1.83, and 2.58 × 104 TU/mL for lentiviral particles carrying SARS-CoV-2 ORF1ab, E, and N motifs, respectively, in the fluorescent mode, which was up to 10 times more sensitive than the colorimetric mode. Furthermore, the LFIA exhibited excellent specificity to SARS-CoV-2 in comparison with other respiratory viruses. It could be used to detect SARS-CoV-2 in saliva samples. The developed LFIA represents a promising and convenient point-of-care method for dual-mode, rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2, especially in the periods with high infectivity.},

ABSTRACT = {Utilizing the immune system as a strategy for disease prevention and treatment is promising, especially with dendritic cells (DCs) playing a central role in adaptive immune responses. The unique properties of DCs drive interest in developing materials for cell-based therapy and immune modulation. Injectable systems require syringe-compatible scaffolds, while hydrogels, like alginate, known for their programmability and biocompatibility, offer a versatile platform for immune medicine enhancement through easy preparation and room-temperature cross-linking. In this study, we synthesized alginate balls loaded with DCs or cytosine–phosphorothioate–guanine deoxyribonucleotide (CpG DNA) microparticles, aiming for long-term immune cell culture with potential immune stimulation effects. Encapsulated DCs exhibited proliferation within the alginate balls for up to 7 days, and CpG MPs were uniformly dispersed, which can facilitate uptake by DCs. This was supported by the result that DCs effectively phagocytosed CpG microparticles in a 2D environment. After the uptake of CpG MPs, the alginate balls with CpG-MP-uptaken DCs were synthesized successfully. The injectable properties of the alginate balls were easily modulated by adjusting the syringe needle gauges. This innovative strategy holds substantial promise for advancing medical treatments, offering effective and comfortable solutions for controlled immune modulation.},

ABSTRACT = {Three-dimensional printing (3DP) technology has revolutionized the field of the use of bioceramics for maxillofacial and periodontal applications, offering unprecedented control over the shape, size, and structure of bioceramic implants. In addition, bioceramics have become attractive materials for these applications due to their biocompatibility, biostability, and favorable mechanical properties. However, despite their advantages, bioceramic implants are still associated with inferior biological performance issues after implantation, such as slow osseointegration, inadequate tissue response, and an increased risk of implant failure. To address these challenges, researchers have been developing strategies to improve the biological performance of 3D-printed bioceramic implants. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of 3DP techniques and strategies for bioceramic materials designed for bone regeneration. The review also addresses the use and incorporation of active biomolecules in 3D-printed bioceramic constructs to stimulate bone regeneration. By controlling the surface roughness and chemical composition of the implant, the construct can be tailored to promote osseointegration and reduce the risk of adverse tissue reactions. Additionally, growth factors, such as bone morphogenic proteins (rhBMP-2) and pharmacologic agent (dipyridamole), can be incorporated to promote the growth of new bone tissue. Incorporating porosity into bioceramic constructs can improve bone tissue formation and the overall biological response of the implant. As such, employing surface modification, combining with other materials, and incorporating the 3DP workflow can lead to better patient healing outcomes.},

ABSTRACT = {Selective laser melting (SLM) technologies are becoming increasingly popular. The aim of the work is to compare the metallographic structure, hardness, and selected strength properties of alloys obtained by casting and by SLM, with a particular emphasis on fatigue strength. Twenty Cr/Co alloy bars were made by casting or SLM, and samples of appropriate dimensions were prepared for individual tests. The microstructures of the samples were tested by metallography, and then tested for hardness, impact strength, tensile strength, bending strength, and fatigue strength; they were also subjected to fracture after bending, tensile, fatigue, and impact tests, with the resulting fractures examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Primary dendrites and small amounts of gas bubbles were present in the cast samples ground lengthwise. The SEM samples were more finer grained and uniform. Compared to the casting samples, the SLM samples demonstrated higher hardness, lower mean impact strength and higher tensile strength. The casting samples also displayed lower mean elongation values. The casting samples demonstrated slightly higher fatigue strength. The fractures of the casting samples showed an interdendritic character with clearly visible dendrites at the fracture, while those of the SLM samples were also intergranular, but finer grained. SLM generally results in better strength properties, while casting obtains slightly greater fatigue strength.},

ABSTRACT = {Coating materials offers an intriguing solution for imparting inert implants with additional bioactive characteristics without changing underlying parameters such as mechanical strength. Metallic implants like endoprostheses or polymeric implants can be coated with a thin layer of bioactive film capable of stimulating bone-forming cells to proliferate or release a drug. However, irrespective of the final implantation site of such a coating biomaterial, it is necessary to conduct detailed mechanical and physicochemical in vitro analyses to determine its likely behavior under biological conditions. In this study, polymeric and composite coatings with hydroxyapatite obtained under UV light underwent incubation tests in four different artificial biological fluids: simulated body fluid (SBF), artificial saliva, Ringer’s fluid, and water (as the reference fluid). The potentiometric and conductometric properties, sorption capacity, and degradation rate of the coatings were examined. Furthermore, their hardness, modulus of elasticity, and deformation were determined. It was demonstrated that the coatings remained stable in SBF liquid at a pH value of around 7.4. In artificial saliva, the greatest degradation of the polymer matrix (ranging between 36.19% and 39.79%) and chipping of hydroxyapatite in the composite coatings were observed. Additionally, the effect of ceramics on sorption capacity was determined, with lower capacity noted with higher HA additions. Moreover, the evaluation of surface morphology supported by elemental microanalysis confirmed the appearance of new apatite layers on the surface as a result of incubation in SBF. Ceramics also influenced mechanical aspects, increasing hardness and modulus of elasticity. For the polymer coatings, the value was 11.48 ± 0.61, while for the composite coating with 15% ceramics, it increased more than eightfold to a value of 93.31 ± 11.18 N/mm2. Based on the conducted studies, the effect of ceramics on the physicochemical as well as mechanical properties of the materials was determined, and their behavior in various biological fluids was evaluated. However, further studies, especially cytotoxicity analyses, are required to determine the potential use of the coatings as biomaterials.},

ABSTRACT = {The azide transfer reaction and copper(I)-catalyzed alkyne-azide cycloaddition (CuAAC) can be used to convert the amino groups in chitosan to triazole 1,2,3-moieties. The resulting polymer has been named chitotriazolan. This synthesis was performed with six different quaternary ammonium alkynes and three amine alkynes to obtain a series of nine water-soluble chitotriazolan derivatives. The structure and complete conversion of the azide were confirmed by FT-IR and proton NMR spectroscopy. The derivatives were investigated for antibacterial activity against S. aureus, E. faecalis, E. coli, and P. aeruginosa. The activity of the quaternized chitotriazolan derivatives varied depending on the structure of the quaternary moiety and the species of bacteria. The basic protonable derivatives were less active or inactive against the bacteria.},

ABSTRACT = {Background: Recent developments in addressing dental aesthetic concerns, encompassing issues like teeth discoloration and halitosis, underscore the demand for safer alternative solutions. Purpose: This study aims to confirm the effects of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) from kimchi on artificial teeth bleaching and their potential impact in terms of preventing halitosis-related bacteria. Materials and Methods: To evaluate the antimicrobial effects against oral pathogens, disc diffusion tests and broth microdilution methods were used. Additionally, crystal violet analysis was performed to confirm the biofilm inhibition effect. The bleaching effects on stained artificial teeth were analyzed using the CIEDE2000 colorimetric method. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 9 with one-way and two-way ANOVA, with the significance level set at α < 0.05. Results: The strain THK-30, isolated from kimchi, exhibited antibacterial activity against Streptococcus mutans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Fusobacterium nucleatum, and was identified as Pediococcus inopinatus. Moreover, THK-30 showed a synergistic antibacterial effect against Gram-negative oral pathogens with 8% sodium hexametaphosphate (SHMP). In the stained artificial teeth bleaching test and artificial teeth biofilm inhibition test, the cell-free supernatant of THK-30 displayed significant teeth bleaching effects and caused the inhibition of biofilm formation, both independently and in combination with SHMP 8%. Conclusions: This study has demonstrated the potential applicability of LAB in teeth discoloration and halitosis. These findings are poised to provide a foundation for the development of research pertaining to the control of oral bacteria.},

ABSTRACT = {Excessive osteoclast activity can promote periodontitis-associated bone destruction. The inhibitory mechanisms of Weissella cibaria strains CMU and CMS1 against periodontitis have not yet been fully elucidated. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether heat-killed (HK) W. cibaria CMU and CMS1 or their respective cell-free supernatants (CFSs) inhibit osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption in response to receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL)-treated RAW 264.7 cells. TRAP (tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase) staining and bone resorption assays revealed that both HK bacteria and CFSs significantly suppressed the number of TRAP-positive cells, TRAP activity, and bone pit formation compared to the RANKL-treated control (p < 0.05). HK bacteria dose-dependently inhibited osteoclastogenesis while selectively regulating certain genes in CFSs (p < 0.05). We found that disrupting the direct interaction between HK bacteria and RAW 264.7 cells abolished the inhibitory effect of HK bacteria on the expression of osteoclastogenesis-associated proteins (c-Fos, nuclear factor of activated T cells c1 (NFATc1), and cathepsin K). These results suggest that dead bacteria suppress osteoclast differentiation more effectively than the metabolites and may serve as beneficial agents in preventing periodontitis by inhibiting osteoclast differentiation via direct interaction with cells.},

ABSTRACT = {Bone regeneration poses a significant challenge in the field of tissue engineering, prompting ongoing research to explore innovative strategies for effective bone healing. The integration of stem cells and nanomaterial scaffolds has emerged as a promising approach, offering the potential to enhance regenerative outcomes. This study focuses on the application of a stem cell-laden nanomaterial scaffold designed for bone regeneration in rabbits. The in vivo study was conducted on thirty-six healthy skeletally mature New Zealand white rabbits that were randomly allocated into six groups. Group A was considered the control, wherein a 15 mm critical-sized defect was created and left as such without any treatment. In group B, this defect was filled with a polycaprolactone–hydroxyapatite (PCL + HAP) scaffold, whereas in group C, a PCL + HAP-carboxylated multiwalled carbon nanotube (PCL + HAP + MWCNT-COOH) scaffold was used. In group D, a PCL + HAP + MWCNT-COOH scaffold was used with local injection of bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) on postoperative days 30, 45, and 60. The rabbit bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (rBMSCs) were seeded onto the PCL + HAP + MWCNT-COOH scaffold by the centrifugal method. In group E, an rBMSC-seeded PCL + HAP + MWCNT-COOH scaffold was used along with the local injection of rBMSC on postoperative days 7, 14, and 21. For group F, in addition to the treatment given to group E, BMP-2 was administered locally on postoperative days 30, 45, and 60. Gross observations, radiological observation, scanning electron microscopic assessment, and histological evaluation study showed that group F displayed the best healing properties, followed by group E, group D, group C, and B. Group A showed no healing with ends blunting minimal fibrous tissue. Incorporating growth factor BMP-2 in tissue-engineered rBMSC-loaded nanocomposite PCL + HAP + MWCNT-COOH construct can augment the osteoinductive and osteoconductive properties, thereby enhancing the healing in a critical-sized bone defect. This novel stem cell composite could prove worthy in the treatment of non-union and delayed union fractures in the near future.},

ABSTRACT = {The study and characterization of the biophysical properties of membranes and drug–membrane interactions represent a critical step in drug development, as biological membranes act as a barrier that the drug must overcome to reach its active site. Liposomes are widely used in drug delivery to circumvent the poor aqueous solubility of most drugs, improving systemic bioavailability and pharmacokinetics. Further, they can be targeted to deliver to specific disease sites, thus decreasing drug load, and reducing side effects and poor adherence to treatment. To improve drug solubility during liposome preparation, DMSO is the most widely used solvent. This raises concern about the potential effect of DMSO on membranes and leads us to investigate, using DSC and EPR, the influence of DMSO on the behavior of lipid model membranes of DMPC and DPPC. In addition, we tested the influence of DMSO on drug–membrane interaction, using compounds with different hydrophobicity and varying DMSO content, using the same experimental techniques. Overall, it was found that with up to 10% DMSO, changes in the bilayer fluidity or the thermotropic properties of the studied liposomes were not significant, within the experimental uncertainty. For higher concentrations of DMSO, there is a stabilization of both the gel and the rippled gel phases, and increased bilayer fluidity of DMPC and DPPC liposomes leading to an increase in membrane permeability.},

ABSTRACT = {To date, the need for biomaterials capable of improving the treatment of chronic skin wounds remains a clinical challenge. The aim of the present work is to formulate and characterize chitosan (Cs)/hydrolyzed collagen (HC) films as potential biomaterials with improved mechanical and hydration performances compared to single component formulations. Films were made by the solvent casting method, with or without glycerin and/or PEG1500 as plasticizers, resulting in a total of eight formulations. All films were characterized by their physico-chemical characteristics and their mechanical and hydration features. A full factorial design was also used to statistically assess the effect of HC concentration, type and concentration of plasticizers and their possible interactions on mechanical and swelling behaviors. Solid state characterization confirmed the hybrid nature of the films, with suggested electrostatic interactions between Cs and HC. Mechanical and swelling properties, along with the analysis of the experimental design, allowed the identification of formulations containing high HC concentration (2% w/v) and glycerin or glycerin/PEG1500 as more suitable candidates for skin wound treatment. Finally, viability assay of immortalized human keratinocytes (HaCaT) showed no statistical differences in cell survival compared to the complete culture medium, suggesting their potential as a promising tool for biomedical applications.},

ABSTRACT = {Hydrofluoric acid (HF) is commonly used as an etchant for the pretreatment of dental computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM) materials, such as glass-ceramics and resin composites. Despite its effectiveness, the harmful and hazardous nature of HF has raised significant safety concerns. In contrast, ammonium fluoride (AF) is known for its relatively low toxicity but has limited etching capability. This study explored the potential of ammonium hydrogen sulfate (AHS), a low-toxicity and weak acid, to enhance the etching ability of aqueous AF solutions for the bonding pretreatment of CAD-CAM materials. This study investigated five types of aesthetic CAD-CAM materials: lithium disilicate glass, feldspathic porcelain, polymer-infiltrated ceramic networks, resin composites, and zirconia. Seven experimental etchants were prepared by varying the amount of AHS added to aqueous AF solutions, with each etchant used to etch the surfaces of the respective CAD-CAM materials. The treated surfaces were analyzed using scanning electron microscopy and confocal laser scanning microscopy. Additionally, the shear bond strength (SBS) of the CAD-CAM materials treated with a luting agent (resin cement) was evaluated. The results indicated that the AF1/AHS3 (weight ratio AF:AHS = 1:3) etchant had the most substantial etching effect on the surfaces of silica-containing materials (lithium disilicate glass, feldspathic porcelain, polymer-infiltrated ceramic networks, and resin composites) but not on zirconia. The SBS of the materials treated with the AF1/AHS3 etchant was comparable to that of the commercial HF etchant. Hence, an AF/AHS mixed solution could effectively etch silica-containing CAD-CAM materials, thereby enhancing their bonding capabilities.},

ABSTRACT = {In this study, nanochitosan dots (ChiDs) were synthesized using gamma rays and encapsulated in bacterial cellulose (BC) polymer matrix for antibiofilm potential in photodynamic therapy. The composites were analyzed for structural changes using SEM, AFM, FTIR, XRD, EPR, and porosity measurements. Additionally, ChiD release was assessed. The results showed that the chemical composition remained unaltered, but ChiD agglomerates embedded in BC changed shape (1.5–2.5 µm). Bacterial cellulose fibers became deformed and interconnected, with increased surface roughness and porosity and decreased crystallinity. No singlet oxygen formation was observed, and the total amount of released ChiD was up to 16.10%. Antibiofilm activity was higher under green light, with reductions ranging from 48 to 57% under blue light and 78 to 85% under green light. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was the most sensitive strain. The new photoactive composite hydrogels show promising potential for combating biofilm-related infections.},

ABSTRACT = {The cost of treatment of antibiotic-resistant pathogens is on the level of tens of billions of dollars at the moment. It is of special interest to reduce or solve this problem using antimicrobial coatings, especially in hospitals or other healthcare facilities. The bacteria can transfer from medical staff or contaminated surfaces to patients. In this paper, we focused our attention on the antibacterial and antibiofouling activities of two types of photodynamic polyurethane composite films doped with carbon polymerized dots (CPDs) and fullerene C60. Detailed atomic force, electrostatic force and viscoelastic microscopy revealed topology, nanoelectrical and nanomechanical properties of used fillers and composites. A relationship between the electronic structure of the nanocarbon fillers and the antibacterial and antibiofouling activities of the composites was established. Thorough spectroscopic analysis of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation was conducted for both composite films, and it was found that both of them were potent antibacterial agents against nosocomial bacteria (Klebsiela pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonela enterica, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus epidermis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Antibiofouling testing of composite films indicated that the CPDs/PU composite films eradicated almost completely the biofilms of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus and about 50% of Escherichia coli biofilms.},

ABSTRACT = {Background: Gynecological cancers are a significant public health concern, accounting for 40% of all cancer incidence and 30% of deaths in women. 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) can be used with chemotherapy to improve treatment in advanced-stage gynecological cancer. Mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) can improve drug effectiveness and reduce toxicity. Folic acid can target folate receptors in epithelial malignancies like ovarian and cervical cancer. Methods: The mixture of MSN-NH2 was synthesized by dissolving N-lauroylsarcosine sodium in a water–ethanol mixture, adding APTES and TEOS, and heating at 80 °C for 18 h, before being fully characterized. The drug is loaded into a 5-FU solution and functionalized with folate. The drug release mechanism, as well as ex vivo intestinal permeation from MSN-NH2 formulations, was tested. The cell viability study of the nanoparticles was evaluated in various cancer cell lines, and the cellular uptake was measured indirectly using HPLC. Results: The study analyzed the amine content, propylamine loading, and drug loading capacity of MSN-NH2 nanoparticles. It found that the loading of propylamine was around 0.733 mmol/g, and the surface density was 0.81 molecules/nm. The study also showed that the surface decoration of MSN-NH2 with folic acid was successfully achieved. The release rate of 5-FU from MSN-NH2 was slow and controlled, with a slower rate at pH 5.5. The study found that the amin surface functionalization of MSN-NH2 nanoparticles can reduce potential toxicity in ovarian and cervical cancer cells. Conclusions: Based on the results, the encapsulation of 5-FU and functionalization of MSN-NH2 with folic acid can serve as potential carriers for 5-FU in treating gynecological cancer.},

ABSTRACT = {Montmorillonite has been refined to overcome uncertainties originating from different sources, which offers opportunities for addressing various health issues, e.g., cosmetics, wound dressings, and antidiarrheal medicines. Herein, three commercial montmorillonite samples were obtained from different sources and labeled M1, M2, and M3 for Ca-montmorillonite, magnesium-enriched Ca-montmorillonite, and silicon-enriched Na-montmorillonite, respectively. Commercial montmorillonite was refined via ultrasonic scission-differential centrifugation and labeled S, M, or L according to the particle sizes (small, medium, or large, respectively). The size distribution decreased from 2000 nm to 250 nm with increasing centrifugation rates from 3000 rpm to 12,000 rpm. Toxicological evaluations with human colon-associated cells and human skin-associated cells indicated that side effects were correlated with excess dosages and silica sand. These side effects were more obvious with human colon-associated cells. The microscopic interactions between micro/nanosized montmorillonite and human colon-associated cells or human skin-associated cells indicated that those interactions were correlated with the size distributions. The interactions of the M1 series with the human cells were attributed to size effects because montmorillonite with a broad size distribution was stored in the M1 series. The M2 series interactions with human cells did not seem to be correlated with size effects because large montmorillonite particles were retained after refining. The M3 series interactions with human cells were attributed to size effects because small montmorillonite particles were retained after refining. This illustrates that toxicological evaluations with refined montmorillonite must be performed in accordance with clinical medical practices.},

ABSTRACT = {Tissue-engineered heart valves can grow, repair, and remodel after implantation, presenting a more favorable long-term solution compared to mechanical and porcine valves. Achieving functional engineered valve tissue requires the maturation of human cells seeded onto valve scaffolds under favorable growth conditions in bioreactors. The mechanical stress and strain on developing valve tissue caused by different pressure and flow conditions in bioreactors are currently unknown. The aim of this study is to quantify the wall shear stress (WSS) magnitude in heart valve prostheses under different valve geometries and bioreactor flow rates. To achieve this, this study used fluid–structure interaction simulations to obtain the valve’s opening geometries during the systolic phase. These geometries were then used in computational fluid dynamics simulations with refined near-wall mesh elements and ranges of prescribed inlet flow rates. The data obtained included histograms and regression curves that characterized the distribution, peak, and median WSS for various flow rates and valve opening configurations. This study also found that the upper region of the valve near the commissures experienced higher WSS magnitudes than the rest of the valve.},

ABSTRACT = {Gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) is a photocrosslinkable biomaterial that has gained widespread use in tissue engineering due to its favorable biological attributes and customizable physical and mechanical traits. While GelMA is compatible with various cell types, distinct cellular responses are observed within GelMA hydrogels. As such, tailoring hydrogels for specific applications has become imperative. Thus, our objective was to develop GelMA hydrogels tailored to enhance cell viability specifically for TC28a2 chondrocytes in a three-dimensional (3D) cell culture setting. We investigated GelMA synthesis using PBS and 0.25M CB buffer, analyzed the mechanical and physical traits of GelMA hydrogels, and evaluated how varying GelMA crosslinking conditions (GelMA concentration, photoinitiator concentration, and UV exposure time) affected the viability of TC28a2 chondrocytes. The results revealed that GelMA synthesis using 0.25M CB buffer led to a greater degree of methacrylation compared to PBS buffer, and the LAP photoinitiator demonstrated superior efficacy for GelMA gelation compared to Irgacure 2959. Additionally, the stiffness, porosity, and swelling degree of GelMA hydrogels were predominantly affected by GelMA concentration, while cell viability was impacted by all crosslinking conditions, decreasing notably with increasing GelMA concentration, photoinitiator concentration, and UV exposure time. This study facilitated the optimization of crosslinking conditions to enhance cell viability within GelMA hydrogels, a critical aspect for diverse biomedical applications.},

ABSTRACT = {Calcium phosphate (CaP) glass has recently gained popularity as a promising material for a wide range of biomedical applications. Recent developments have seen CaP glasses moving from a passive implant material to an active degradable material, particularly as a major constituent of bioresorbable photonic devices. This holds great promise in advanced biomedical applications, since the main constituents of CaP glasses are present in the human body. In this review, the progressive advancements in the biomedical applications of calcium phosphate glass-based devices over the past 50 years are discussed. An overview of their role as reinforcing agents and the studies on doping their matrices for ion releasing and drug and gene delivery are reviewed. Recent applications of CaP glass and fibers in soft-tissue engineering and their potential for optical quality bioresorbable devices are then discussed along with the current challenges and potential future directions, emphasizing the promising role of CaP glass in the next generation of biomaterials.

ABSTRACT = {The chitin and chitosan biopolymers are extremely valuable because of their numerous industrial and pharmacological uses. Chitin and chitosan were extracted from the exoskeleton of Periplaneta americana (cockroaches) and termites using various acid and alkali techniques. The extraction process involves an initial demineralization step, during which integument dry powder was subjected to 500 mL (2.07 mol/L) of concentrated HCl at 100 degrees Celsius for 30 min, followed by meticulous rinsing with distilled water to restore the pH to its baseline. Deproteinization was conducted at 80 degrees Celsius using 500 mL (1 mol/L) of NaOH solution, which was repeated for 24 h. A total of 250 mL (0.06 mol/L) of NaOH was added at 100 degrees Celsius for 4 h to obtain chitosan, followed by extensive washing and subsequent drying. FTIR analysis was used to identify the functional groups in Periplaneta americana and termites. The crystallinity of these biopolymers, which have a face-centered cubic structure, was determined by X-ray diffraction analysis. This study assessed the analgesic properties of chitin and chitosan via an acetic-acid-induced writhing test in mice, revealing a significant reduction in writhing behavior following the chitin and chitosan extract. Notably, chitin exhibits the highest degree of analgesic activity compared to chitosan. Both chitin and chitosan show anti-inflammatory effects, with chitosan absorbing proton ions at sites of inflammation, while chitin effectively inhibits ear edema and elicits an analgesic response in mice. Furthermore, the present study revealed antipyretic activity, with termite chitin demonstrating the most significant effect at a concentration of 500 µL/mL, followed by chitosan and chitin at 100 µL/mL. These findings indicate the potential of using chitin and chitosan derived from termites and Periplaneta americana as natural anti-inflammatory compounds, implying prospective uses in anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, and analgesic capabilities.},

ABSTRACT = {Copper-based nanomaterials have been employed as therapeutic agents for cancer therapy and diagnosis. Nevertheless, persistent challenges, such as cellular toxicity, non-uniform sizes, and low photothermal efficiency, often constrain their applications. In this study, we present Cu2+-loaded silica nanoparticles fabricated through the chelation of Cu2+ ions by silanol groups. The integration of Cu2+ ions into uniformly sized silica nanoparticles imparts a photothermal therapy effect. Additionally, the amine functionalization of the silica coating facilitates the chemical conjugation of tumor-specific fluorescence probes. These probes are strategically designed to remain in an ‘off’ state through the Förster resonance energy transfer mechanism until exposed to cysteine enzymes in cancer cells, inducing the recovery of their fluorescence. Consequently, our Cu2+-loaded silica nanoparticles demonstrate an efficient photothermal therapy effect and selectively enable cancer imaging.},

ABSTRACT = {Three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting is a fast prototyping fabrication approach that allows the development of new implants for tissue restoration. Although various materials have been utilized for this process, they lack mechanical, electrical, chemical, and biological properties. To overcome those limitations, graphene-based materials demonstrate unique mechanical and electrical properties, morphology, and impermeability, making them excellent candidates for 3D bioprinting. This review summarizes the latest developments in graphene-based materials in 3D printing and their application in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Over the years, different 3D printing approaches have utilized graphene-based materials, such as graphene, graphene oxide (GO), reduced GO (rGO), and functional GO (fGO). This process involves controlling multiple factors, such as graphene dispersion, viscosity, and post-curing, which impact the properties of the 3D-printed graphene-based constructs. To this end, those materials combined with 3D printing approaches have demonstrated prominent regeneration potential for bone, neural, cardiac, and skin tissues. Overall, graphene in 3D bioprinting may pave the way for new regenerative strategies with translational implications in orthopedics, neurology, and cardiovascular areas.},

ABSTRACT = {Dental implants and bone augmentation are among dentistry’s most prevalent surgical treatments; hence, many dental implant surfaces and bone grafts have been researched to improve bone response. Such new materials were radiologically, histologically, and histomorphometrically evaluated on animals before being used on humans. As a result, several studies used animals to evaluate novel implant technologies, biocompatibility, surgical techniques, and osseointegration strategies, as preclinical research on animal models is essential to evaluate bioactive principles (on cells, compounds, and implants) that can act through multiple mechanisms and to predict animal behavior, which is difficult to predict from in vitro studies alone. In this study, we critically reviewed all research on different animal models investigating the osseointegration degree of new implant surfaces, reporting different species used in the osseointegration research over the last 30 years. Moreover, this is the first study to summarize reviews on the main animal models used in the translational research of osseointegration, including the advantages and limitations of each model and determining the ideal location for investigating osseointegration in small and large animal models. Overall, each model has advantages and disadvantages; hence, animal selection should be based on the cost of acquisition, animal care, acceptability to society, availability, tolerance to captivity, and housing convenience. Among small animal models, rabbits are an ideal model for biological observations around implants, and it is worth noting that osseointegration was discovered in the rabbit model and successfully applied to humans.},

ABSTRACT = {Acquired cranial defects are a prevalent condition in neurosurgery and call for cranioplasty, where the missing or defective cranium is replaced by an implant. Nevertheless, the biomaterials in current clinical applications are hardly exempt from long-term safety and comfort concerns. An appealing solution is regenerative cranioplasty, where biomaterials with/without cells and bioactive molecules are applied to induce the regeneration of the cranium and ultimately repair the cranial defects. This review examines the current state of research, development, and translational application of regenerative cranioplasty biomaterials and discusses the efforts required in future research. The first section briefly introduced the regenerative capacity of the cranium, including the spontaneous bone regeneration bioactivities and the presence of pluripotent skeletal stem cells in the cranial suture. Then, three major types of biomaterials for regenerative cranioplasty, namely the calcium phosphate/titanium (CaP/Ti) composites, mineralised collagen, and 3D-printed polycaprolactone (PCL) composites, are reviewed for their composition, material properties, and findings from clinical trials. The third part discusses perspectives on future research and development of regenerative cranioplasty biomaterials, with a considerable portion based on issues identified in clinical trials. This review aims to facilitate the development of biomaterials that ultimately contribute to a safer and more effective healing of cranial defects.},

ABSTRACT = {This in vitro study aims to assess the cyclic fatigue resistance of the Protaper Ultimate (PTU) files compared to the Protaper Gold (PTG) and the M3 UDG (M3) files using various motion kinematics in simulated canals. As far as the authors are aware, no study has previously compared the three file systems before this current investigation. Therefore, closing this information gap is the goal of the current research. Methods: A total of (60 new endodontic files were randomly divided into 6 groups (10 files per group); groups 1, 3, and 5 used continuous rotation (CR), while groups 2, 4, and 6 used forward reciprocating motion (FRM). A manufactured stainless-steel artificial canal was used to perform the cyclic fatigue testing. The results were analyzed using Student’s t-test and two-way ANOVA. All pairwise comparisons revealed statistically significant differences in the time to failure (TTF) for every study group (p < 0.001), with the exception of the PTG and M3 files, which performed similarly using both CR and FRM. Conclusions: The PTU files performed better than the PTG and M3 files in terms of the TTF and number of cycles to failure (NCF) using both CR and FRM.},

ABSTRACT = {The possibility of dental pulp damage during dental procedures is well known. According to studies, during finishing and polishing without cooling, temperatures of up to 140 °C or more can be generated. There are many studies that have analysed the influence of the finishing and polishing of fillings on the mechanical parameters, but the analysis of thermal parameters has led to uncertain results due to the difficulty of performing this in vivo. Background: We set out to conduct a study, using the finite element method, to determine the extent to which the type of class II cavity and the volume of the composite filling influence the duration of heat transfer to the pulp during finishing and polishing without cooling. Materials and Methods: A virtual model of an upper primary molar was used, with a caries process located on the distal aspect, in which four types of cavities were digitally prepared: direct access, horizontal slot, vertical slot and occlusal–proximal. All four cavity types were filled using a Filtek Supreme XT nanocomposite. Results: The study showed that the filling volume almost inversely proportionally influences the time at which the dental pulp reaches the critical temperature of irreversible damage. The lowest duration occurred in occlusal–distal restorations and the highest in direct access restorations. Conclusions: based on the results of the study, a working protocol can be issued so that finishing and polishing restorations without cooling are safe for pulpal health.},

ABSTRACT = {This study investigates the viscoelastic deformation mechanisms of bone as a response to Vickers hardness indentation. We utilized advanced high-resolution scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to investigate a distinct deformation pattern that originates from the indentation site within the bone matrix. The focus of our research was to analyze a unique deformation mechanism observed in bone tissue, which has been colloquially termed as “screw-like” due to its resemblance to a screw thread when viewed under an optical microscope. The primary goals of this research are to investigate the distinctive characteristics of the “screw-like” deformation pattern and to determine how the microstructure of bone influences the initiation and control of this mechanism. These patterns, emerging during the dwell period of indentation, underscore the viscoelastic nature of bone, indicating its propensity for energy dissipation and microstructural reconfiguration under load. This study uncovered a direct correlation between the length of the “screw-like” deformation and the duration of the indentation dwell time, providing quantifiable evidence of the bone’s viscoelastic behavior. This finding is pivotal in understanding the mechanical properties of bone, including its fracture toughness, as it relates to the complex interplay of factors such as energy dissipation, microstructural reinforcement, and stress distribution. Furthermore, this study discusses the implications of viscoelastic properties on the bone’s ability to resist mechanical challenges, underscoring the significance of viscoelasticity in bone research.},

ABSTRACT = {Nerve guidance conduits for peripheral nerve injuries can be improved using bioactive materials such as magnesium (Mg) and its alloys, which could provide both structural and trophic support. Therefore, we investigated whether exposure to Mg and Mg-1.6wt%Li thin films (Mg/Mg-1.6Li) would alter acute Schwann cell responses to injury. Using the RT4-D6P2T Schwannoma cell line (SCs), we tested extracts from freeze-killed cells (FKC) and nerves (FKN) as in vitro injury stimulants. Both FKC and FKN induced SC release of the macrophage chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), a marker of the repair SC phenotype after injury. Next, FKC-stimulated cells exposed to Mg/Mg-1.6Li reduced MCP-1 release by 30%, suggesting that these materials could have anti-inflammatory effects. Exposing FKC-treated cells to Mg/Mg-1.6Li reduced the gene expression of the nerve growth factor (NGF), glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), and myelin protein zero (MPZ), but not the p75 neurotrophin receptor. In the absence of FKC, Mg/Mg-1.6Li treatment increased the expression of NGF, p75, and MPZ, which can be beneficial to nerve regeneration. Thus, the presence of Mg can differentially alter SCs, depending on the microenvironment. These results demonstrate the applicability of this in vitro nerve injury model, and that Mg has wide-ranging effects on the repair SC phenotype.},

ABSTRACT = {The present study aimed to formulate and characterize a hesperetin formulation to achieve adequate deposition and retention of hesperetin in the epidermis as a target for some cosmetic/dermatological actions. To derive the final emulgel, various formulations incorporating different proportions of Polysorbate 80 and hyaluronic acid underwent testing through a Box–Behnken experimental design. Nine formulations were created until the targeted emulgel properties were achieved. This systematic approach, following the principles of a design of experiment (DoE) methodology, adheres to a quality-by-design (QbD) paradigm, ensuring a robust and purposeful formulation and highlighting the commitment to a quality-driven design approach. The emulsions were developed using the phase inversion method, optimizing the emulgel with the incorporation of hyaluronic acid. Physically stable optimized emulgels were evaluated for their globule size, surface charge, viscosity, pH, electrical conductivity, and hesperetin content. These assays, along with the temperature swing test, were used to select the optimal formulation. It was characterized by a droplet size, d[4,3], of 4.02 μm, a Z-potential of −27.8 mV, an O/W sign, a pH of 5.2, and a creamy texture and proved to be stable for at least 2 months at room temperature. Additionally, in vitro release kinetics from the selected emulgel exhibited a sustained release profile of hesperetin. Skin assays revealed adequate retention of hesperetin in the human epidermis with minimum permeation. Altogether, these results corroborate the promising future of the proposed emulgel in cosmetic or dermatological use on healthy or diseased skin.},

ABSTRACT = {Synthesis of bioinks for bioprinting of respiratory tissue requires considerations related to immunogenicity, mechanical properties, printability, and cellular compatibility. Biomaterials can be tailored to provide the appropriate combination of these properties through the synergy of materials with individual pros and cons. Sodium alginate, a water-soluble polymer derived from seaweed, is a cheap yet printable biomaterial with good structural properties; however, it lacks physiological relevance and cell binding sites. Collagen, a common component in the extra cellular matrix of many tissues, is expensive and lacks printability; however, it is highly biocompatible and exhibits sites for cellular binding. This paper presents our study on the synthesis of bioinks from alginate and collagen for use in bioprinting respiratory tissue models. Bioinks were synthesized from 40 mg/mL (4%) alginate and 3 mg/mL (0.3%) collagen in varying ratios (1:0, 4:1, 3:1, 2:1, and 1:1); then examined in terms of rheological properties, printability, compressive, and tensile properties and cellular compatibility. The results illustrate that the ratio of alginate to collagen has a profound impact on bioink performance and that, among the examined ratios, the 3:1 ratio is the most appropriate for use in bioprinting respiratory tissue scaffolds.},

ABSTRACT = {Zirconia ceramic implants are commercially available from a rapidly growing number of manufacturers. Macroscopic and microscopic surface design and characteristics are considered to be key determining factors in the success of the osseointegration process. It is, therefore, crucial to assess which surface modification promotes the most favorable biological response. The purpose of this study was to conduct a comparison of modern surface modifications that are featured in the most common commercially available zirconia ceramic implant systems. A review of the currently available literature on zirconia implant surface topography and the associated bio-physical factors was conducted, with a focus on the osseointegration of zirconia surfaces. After a review of the selected articles for this study, commercially available zirconia implant surfaces were all modified using subtractive protocols. Commercially available ceramic implant surfaces were modified or enhanced using sandblasting, acid etching, laser etching, or combinations of the aforementioned. From our literature review, laser-modified surfaces emerged as the ones with the highest surface roughness and bone–implant contact (BIC). It was also found that surface roughness could be controlled to achieve optimal roughness by modifying the laser output power during manufacturing. Furthermore, laser surface modification induced a very low amount of preload microcracks in the zirconia. Osteopontin (OPN), an early–late osteogenic differentiation marker, was significantly upregulated in laser-treated surfaces. Moreover, surface wettability was highest in laser-treated surfaces, indicating favorable hydrophilicity and thus promoting early bone forming, cell adhesion, and subsequent maturation. Sandblasting followed by laser modification and sandblasting followed by acid etching and post-milling heat treatment (SE-H) surfaces featured comparable results, with favorable biological responses around zirconia implants.},

Here, we present a novel biocompatible material based on polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) doped with BODIPY derivatives containing an N-nitroso moiety that is capable of the photoinduced generation of NO. We study the green-light-induced NO-release properties with the following three methods: electrochemical gas-phase sensor, liquid-phase sensor, and the Griess assay. Prolonged release of NO from the polymer films after short irradiation by narrow-band LED light sources and a laser beam is demonstrated. Importantly, this was accompanied by no or little release of the parent compound (BODIPY-based photodonor). Silicone films with the capability of controllable and clean NO release can potentially be used as a highly portable NO delivery system for different therapeutic applications.},

ABSTRACT = {The human mandible’s cancellous bone, which is characterized by its unique porosity and directional sensitivity to external forces, is crucial for sustaining biting stress. Traditional computer- aided design (CAD) models fail to fully represent the bone’s anisotropic structure and thus depend on simple isotropic assumptions. For our research, we use the latest versions of nTOP 4.17.3 and Creo Parametric 8.0 software to make biomimetic Voronoi lattice models that accurately reflect the complex geometry and mechanical properties of trabecular bone. The porosity of human cancellous bone is accurately modeled in this work using biomimetic Voronoi lattice models. The porosities range from 70% to 95%, which can be achieved by changing the pore sizes to 1.0 mm, 1.5 mm, 2.0 mm, and 2.5 mm. Finite element analysis (FEA) was used to examine the displacements, stresses, and strains acting on dental implants with a buttress thread, abutment, retaining screw, and biting load surface. The results show that the Voronoi model accurately depicts the complex anatomy of the trabecular bone in the human jaw, compared to standard solid block models. The ideal pore size for biomimetic Voronoi lattice trabecular bone models is 2 mm, taking in to account both the von Mises stress distribution over the dental implant, screw retention, cortical bone, cancellous bone, and micromotions. This pore size displayed balanced performance by successfully matching natural bone’s mechanical characteristics. Advanced FEA improves the biomechanical understanding of how bones and implants interact by creating more accurate models of biological problems and dynamic loading situations. This makes biomechanical engineering better.},

ABSTRACT = {Phenolic compounds are the main phytochemical constituents of many higher plants. They play an important role in synthesizing metal nanoparticles using green technology due to their ability to reduce metal salts and stabilize them through physical interaction/conjugation to the metal surface. Six pure phenolic compounds were isolated from licorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra) and employed in synthesizing gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). The isolated compounds were identified as liquiritin (1), isoliquiritin (2), neoisoliquiritin (3), isoliquiritin apioside (4), liquiritin apioside (5), and glabridin (6). The synthesized AuNPs were characterized using UV, zeta sizer, HRTEM, and IR and tested for their stability in different biological media. The phenolic isolates and their corresponding synthesized NP conjugates were tested for their potential in vitro cytotoxicity. The anti-inflammatory effects were investigated in both normal and inflammation-induced settings, where inflammatory biomarkers were stimulated using lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) in the RAW 264.7 macrophage cell line. LPS, functioning as a mitogen, promotes cell growth by reducing apoptosis, potentially contributing to observed outcomes. Results indicated that all six pure phenolic isolates inhibited cell proliferation. The AuNP conjugates of all the phenolic isolates, except liquiritin apioside (5), inhibited cell viability. LPS initiates inflammatory markers by binding to cell receptors and setting off a cascade of events leading to inflammation. All the pure phenolic isolates, except isoliquiritin, neoisoliquiritin, and isoliquiritin apioside inhibited the inflammatory activity of RAW cells in vitro.},

ABSTRACT = {Re-tightening the loosened dental implant abutment screw is an accepted procedure, however the evidence that such screw will hold sufficiently is weak. The purpose of this study was material analysis of lost dental implant abutment screws made of the TiAlV alloy from various manufacturers, which became lost due to unscrewing or damaged when checking if unscrewed; undamaged screws could be safely re-tightened. Among 13 failed screws retrieved from 10 cases, 10 screws were removed due to untightening and 3 were broken but without mechanical damage at the threads. Advanced corrosion was found on nine screws after 2 years of working time on all surfaces, also not mechanically loaded. Sediments observed especially in the thread area did not affect the corrosion process because of no pit densification around sediments. Pitting corrosion visible in all long-used screws raises the question of whether the screws should be replaced after a certain period during service, even if they are well-tightened. This requires further research on the influence of the degree of corrosion on the loss of the load-bearing ability of the screw.},

ABSTRACT = {This study investigated the incorporation of sources of calcium, phosphate, or both into electrospun scaffolds and evaluated their bioactivity on human dental pulp cells (HDPCs). Additionally, scaffolds incorporated with calcium hydroxide (CH) were characterized for degradation, calcium release, and odontogenic differentiation by HDPCs. Polycaprolactone (PCL) was electrospun with or without 0.5% w/v of calcium hydroxide (PCL + CH), nano-hydroxyapatite (PCL + nHA), or β-glycerophosphate (PCL + βGP). SEM/EDS analysis confirmed fibrillar morphology and particle incorporation. HDPCs were cultured on the scaffolds to assess cell viability, adhesion, spreading, and mineralized matrix formation. PCL + CH was also evaluated for gene expression of odontogenic markers (RT-qPCR). Data were submitted to ANOVA and Student’s t-test (α = 5%). Added CH increased fiber diameter and interfibrillar spacing, whereas βGP decreased both. PCL + CH and PCL + nHA improved HDPC viability, adhesion, and proliferation. Mineralization was increased eightfold with PCL + CH. Scaffolds containing CH gradually degraded over six months, with calcium release within the first 140 days. CH incorporation upregulated DSPP and DMP1 expression after 7 and 14 days. In conclusion, CH- and nHA-laden PCL fiber scaffolds were cytocompatible and promoted HDPC adhesion, proliferation, and mineralized matrix deposition. PCL + CH scaffolds exhibit a slow degradation profile, providing sustained calcium release and stimulating HDPCs to upregulate odontogenesis marker genes.},

ABSTRACT = {Plasma gel (PG) is a protein matrix prepared from platelet-poor plasma and can be utilized as a drug carrier for controlled release. We previously demonstrated its applicability as a carrier of polyphosphate. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) is the main flavonoid found in green tea and functions as a strong antioxidant. To explore the applicability of PG as an EGCG carrier, we examined the release of EGCG from the PG matrix using an in vitro system. Pooled platelet-poor plasma (PPP) was prepared from four healthy adult male donors, mixed with EGCG, and heated at 75 °C for 10 or 20 min to prepare the PG matrix. The PG–EGCG matrix was incubated in PBS at 37 °C, and the EGCG released into PBS was determined using spectrophotometry. The antioxidant capacity was determined based on the principle of the iodine decolorization reaction. EGCG precipitated and incorporated into the PG matrix during thermal preparation. Trypsin, used to simulate the in vivo degradation of PG, released EGCG from the PG matrix over time. The released EGCG maintained its antioxidant capacity during incubation. These results indicate that thermally prepared PG matrices can be utilized as a promising EGCG carrier in the fields of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.},

ABSTRACT = {This study presents the first 10-year follow-up investigation of the implant survival and peri-implant outcomes of one-piece mini dental implants (MDIs) retaining mandibular implant overdentures (IODs), including marginal bone level alterations (ΔMBLs), clinical peri-implant parameters, and complications. Twenty participants with horizontally atrophied mandibles received complete dentures and four MDIs (diameter 1.8 mm) at baseline. The dentures were converted into IODs with O-ring attachments. The 10-year follow-up comprised a radiological assessment of ΔMBLs, peri-implant parameters, as well as biological and technical complications. Results from a 10-year follow-up of 14 participants showed a 100% implant survival rate for all 56 implants. The mean ΔMBL after 10 years was −1.12 ± 0.80 mm, with 49 implants classified as successful (ΔMBL < 2 mm) and 7 implants with satisfactory survival (ΔMBL 2–4 mm). Time after implant placement significantly influenced ΔMBL, with stable MBLs after 5 years. The prosthetic survival rate after 10 years was 93%. ΔMBLs were not influenced by implant position or gender but were significantly smaller in subjects older than 65 years. Conclusively, one-piece MDIs with O-ring attachments offer a reliable treatment option for horizontally atrophied mandibles after 10 years, with high implant and prosthetic survival rates, potentially benefiting from advanced age regarding peri-implant bone stability.},

ABSTRACT = {This study explored the chemical and antibacterial properties of a dental resin loaded with gold nanoshells (AuNPs) in conjunction with photothermal therapy (PTT) as a novel method against Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans) to prevent secondary caries. First, a 20-h minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) assay was performed on solutions of AuNPs with planktonic S. mutans under an LED device and laser at 660 nm. Next, resin blends containing 0, 1 × 1010, or 2 × 1010 AuNPs/mL were fabricated, and the degree of conversion (DC) was measured using an FTIR spectroscopy. Lastly, a colony forming unit (CFU) count was performed following 24 h growth of S. mutans on 6 mm diameter resin disks with different light treatments of an LED device and a laser at 660 nm. The MIC results only showed a reduction in S. mutans at AuNP concentrations less than 3.12 µg/mL under a laser illumination level of 95.5 J/cm2 compared to the dark treatment (p < 0.010 for each). CFU and DC results showed no significant dependence on any light treatment studied. The AuNPs expressed antibacterial effects following PPT against planktonic S. mutans but not in a polymerized dental adhesive resin. Future studies should focus on different shapes, structure, and concentrations of AuNPs loaded in a resin blend.},

ABSTRACT = {This study aims to analyse, using a finite element analysis, the effects of Ti-base abutment height on the distribution and magnitude of transferred load and the resulting bone microstrain in the bone-implant system. A three-dimensional bone model of the mandibular premolar section was created with an implant placed in a juxta-osseous position. Three prosthetic models were designed: a 1 mm-high titanium-base (Ti-base) abutment with an 8 mm-high cemented monolithic zirconia crown was designed for model A, a 2 mm-high Ti-base abutment with a 7 mm-high crown for model B, and a 3 mm-high abutment with a 6 mm-high crown for model C. A static load of 150 N was applied to the central fossa at a six-degree angle with respect to the axial axis of the implant to evaluate the magnitude and distribution of load transfer and microstrain. The results showed a trend towards a direct linear association between the increase in the height of the Ti-base abutments and the increase in the transferred stress and the resulting microstrain to both the prosthetic elements and the bone/implant system. An increase in transferred stress and deformation of all elements of the system, within physiological ranges, was observed as the size of the Ti-base abutment increased.},

ABSTRACT = {The dermal–epidermal junction (DEJ), located between the dermal–epidermal layers in human skin tissue, plays a significant role in its function. However, the limitations of biomaterial properties and microstructure fabrication methods mean that most current tissue engineered skin models do not consider the existence of DEJ. In this study, a nanofiber membrane that simulates the fluctuating structure of skin DEJ was prepared by the composite molding process. Electrospinning is a technique for the production of nanofibers, which can customize the physical and biological properties of biomaterials. At present, electrospinning technology is widely used in the simulation of customized natural skin DEJ. In this study, four different concentration ratios of poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) and polycaprolactone (PCL) nanofiber membranes were prepared based on electrospinning technology. We selected a 15%PLGA + 5%PCL nanofiber membrane with mechanical properties, dimensional stability, hydrophilicity, and biocompatibility after physical properties and biological characterization. Then, the array-based microstructure model was prepared by three-dimensional (3D) printing. Subsequently, the microstructure was created on a 15%PLGA + 5%PCL membrane by the micro-imprinting process. Finally, the cell proliferation and live/dead tests of keratinocytes (HaCaTs) and fibroblasts (HSFs) were measured on the microstructural membrane and flat membrane. The results showed that 15%PLGA + 5%PCL microstructure membrane was more beneficial to promote the adhesion and proliferation of HaCaTs and HSFs than a flat membrane.},

ABSTRACT = {The world is fighting infectious diseases. Therefore, effective antimicrobials are required to prevent the spread of microbes and protect human health. Zinc oxide (ZnO) nano-materials are known for their antimicrobial activities. Because of their distinctive physical and chemical characteristics, they can be used in medical and environmental applications. ZnO-based composites are among the leading sources of antimicrobial research. They are effective at killing (microbicidal) and inhibiting the growth (microbiostatic) of numerous microorganisms, such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi. Although most studies have focused on the microbicidal features, there is a lack of reviews on their microbiostatic effects. This review provides a detailed overview of available reports on the microbiostatic activities of ZnO-based nano-materials against different microorganisms. Additionally, the factors that affect the efficacy of these materials, their time course, and a comparison of the available antimicrobials are highlighted in this review. The basic properties of ZnO, challenges of working with microorganisms, and working mechanisms of microbiostatic activities are also examined. This review underscores the importance of further research to better understand ZnO-based nano-materials for controlling microbial growth.},

ABSTRACT = {Binary mixtures of active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) are researched to improve the oral bioavailability of pharmaceutical dosage forms. The purpose of this study was to obtain mixtures of meloxicam and L-tartaric acid because tartaric acid improves intestinal absorption and meloxicam is more soluble in a weakly basic environment. The mixtures in the 0–1 molar fraction range, obtained from solvent-assisted mechanosynthesis, were investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Raman spectroscopy (FT-Raman), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and solubility tests. The physicochemical characteristics of the compounds obtained from DSC data reveal, for the first time, the formation of a co-crystal at meloxicam molar fraction of 0.5. FTIR spectroscopy data show the existence of hydrogen bonds between the co-crystal components meloxicam and L-tartaric acid. FT-Raman spectroscopy was used complementary with FT-IR spectroscopy to analyze the pure APIs and their mixtures, to emphasize the appearance/disappearance and the shifts of the position/intensity of vibrational bands, following the formation of hydrogen-bonded structures or van der Waals interactions, and to especially monitor the crystal lattice vibrations below 400 cm−1. The experimental results obtained by X-ray powder diffraction confirmed the formation of the co-crystal by the loss and, respectively, the apparition of peaks from the single components in the co-crystal diffractogram. The solubility tests showed that the co-crystal product has a lower aqueous solubility due to the acidic character of the other component, tartaric acid. However, when the solubility tests were performed in buffer solution of pH 7.4, the solubility of meloxicam from the co-crystal mixture was increased by 57% compared to that of pure meloxicam. In conclusion, the studied API mixtures may be considered potential biomaterials for improved drug release molecular solids.},

ABSTRACT = {This study aimed to develop gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA)-injectable hydrogels incorporated with 58S bioactive glass/BG-doped with strontium for vital pulp therapy applications. GelMA hydrogels containing 0% (control), 5%, 10%, and 20% BG (w/v) were prepared. Their morphological and chemical properties were evaluated by scanning electron microscopy/SEM, energy dispersive spectroscopy/EDS, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy/FTIR (n = 3). Their swelling capacity and degradation ratio were also measured (n = 4). Cell viability (n = 8), mineralized matrix formation, cell adhesion, and spreading (n = 6) on DPSCs were evaluated. Data were analyzed using ANOVA/post hoc tests (α = 5%). SEM and EDS characterization confirmed the incorporation of BG particles into the hydrogel matrix, showing GelMA’s (C, O) and BG’s (Si, Cl, Na, Sr) chemical elements. FTIR revealed the main chemical groups of GelMA and BG, as ~1000 cm−1 corresponds to Si-O and ~1440 cm−1 to C-H. All the formulations were degraded by day 12, with a lower degradation ratio observed for GelMA+BG20%. Increasing the concentration of BG resulted in a lower mass swelling ratio. Biologically, all the groups were compatible with cells (p > 0.6196), and cell adhesion increased over time, irrespective of BG concentration, indicating great biocompatibility. GelMA+BG5% demonstrated a higher deposition of mineral nodules over 21 days (p < 0.0001), evidencing the osteogenic potential of hydrogels. GelMA hydrogels incorporated with BG present great cytocompatibility, support cell adhesion, and have a clinically relevant degradation profile and suitable mineralization potential, supporting their therapeutic potential as promising biomaterials for pulp capping.},

ABSTRACT = {In orthopaedics, erythropoietin (EPO) is applied in the preoperative management of anaemic patients, but also as a stimulating factor to assist bone regeneration due to its angiogenic and osteoinductive potential. Since orthopaedists mainly rely on their clinical experience to assess bone healing, additional and more objective methods such as studying the dynamics of bone markers are needed. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the plasma activity of bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BALP), the N-terminal propeptide of type I collagen (PINP), the C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX), and deoxypyridinoline (DPD) during the first 2 months of healing of comminuted fractures in cats, either non-stimulated or locally stimulated with recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO). The study included twelve cats of mixed breeds, aged 7.2 ± 4 months, weighing 2.11 ± 1.1 kg, with comminuted diaphyseal fractures of the femur. Surgical treatment with plate osteosynthesis was performed in all animals. The cats were randomly divided into two groups—a control (n = 6) and an EPO group (n = 6). The locally applied EPO leads to the increased activity of bone formation markers (BALP and PINP) during the second week after the osteosynthesis, preceding the peaks in the control group by two weeks. The studied bone resorption markers (DPD, CTX) varied insignificantly during the studied period. In conclusion, erythropoietin could serve as a promoter of bone healing in comminuted fractures in cats.},

ABSTRACT = {Bone defects resulting from trauma, diseases, or surgical procedures pose significant challenges in the field of oral and maxillofacial surgery. The development of effective bone substitute materials that promote bone healing and regeneration is crucial for successful clinical outcomes. Calcium phosphate cements (CPCs) have emerged as promising candidates for bone replacement due to their biocompatibility, bioactivity, and ability to integrate with host tissues. However, there is a continuous demand for further improvements in the mechanical properties, biodegradability, and bioactivity of these materials. Dual setting of cements is one way to improve the performance of CPCs. Therefore, silicate matrices can be incorporated in these cements. Silicate-based materials have shown great potential in various biomedical applications, including tissue engineering and drug delivery systems. In the context of bone regeneration, silicate matrices offer unique advantages such as improved mechanical stability, controlled release of bioactive ions, and enhanced cellular responses. Comprehensive assessments of both the material properties and biological responses of our samples were conducted. Cytocompatibility was assessed through in vitro testing using osteoblastic (MG-63) and osteoclastic (RAW 264.7) cell lines. Cell activity on the surfaces was quantified, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was employed to capture images of the RAW cells. In our study, incorporation of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) in dual-curing cements significantly enhanced physical properties, attributed to increased crosslinking density and reduced pore size. Higher alkoxysilyl group concentration improved biocompatibility by facilitating greater crosslinking. Additionally, our findings suggest citrate’s potential as an alternative retarder due to its positive interaction with the silicate matrix, offering insights for future dental material research. This paper aims to provide an overview of the importance of silicate matrices as modifiers for calcium phosphate cements, focusing on their impact on the mechanical properties, setting behaviour, and biocompatibility of the resulting composites.},

ABSTRACT = {In recent years, the use of zinc (Zn) alloys as degradable metal materials has attracted considerable attention in the field of biomedical bone implant materials. This study investigates the fabrication of porous scaffolds using a Zn-1Mg-0.1Sr alloy through a three-dimensional (3D) printing technique, selective laser melting (SLM). The results showed that the porous Zn-1Mg-0.1Sr alloy scaffold featured a microporous structure and exhibited a compressive strength (CS) of 33.71 ± 2.51 MPa, a yield strength (YS) of 27.88 ± 1.58 MPa, and an elastic modulus (E) of 2.3 ± 0.8 GPa. During the immersion experiments, the immersion solution showed a concentration of 2.14 ± 0.82 mg/L for Zn2+ and 0.34 ± 0.14 mg/L for Sr2+, with an average pH of 7.61 ± 0.09. The porous Zn-1Mg-0.1Sr alloy demonstrated a weight loss of 12.82 ± 0.55% and a corrosion degradation rate of 0.36 ± 0.01 mm/year in 14 days. The Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay was used to check the viability of the cells. The results showed that the 10% and 20% extracts significantly increased the activity of osteoblast precursor cells (MC3T3-E1), with a cytotoxicity grade of 0, which indicates safety and non-toxicity. In summary, the porous Zn-1Mg-0.1Sr alloy scaffold exhibits outstanding mechanical properties, an appropriate degradation rate, and favorable biosafety, making it an ideal candidate for degradable metal bone implants.},

ABSTRACT = {Modular artificial hip joints are a clinical standard today. However, the release of wear products from the head–taper interface, which includes wear particles in the nm size range, as well as metal ions, have raised concerns. Depending on the loading of such taper joints, a wide variety of different mechanisms have been found by retrieval analyses. From these, this paper concentrates on analyzing the contribution of gross slip fretting corrosion at ultra-mild wear rates using a bovine calf serum solution (BCS) as the lubricant. The parameters were chosen based on biomechanical considerations, producing wear rates of some ng/m wear path. In parallel, the evolution of tribomaterial (third bodies) was analyzed as to its constituents and generation rates. It has already been shown earlier that, by an advantageous combination of wear mechanisms and submechanisms, certain constituents of the tribomaterial remain inside the contact area and act like extreme-pressure lubricant additives. For the known wear and corrosion resistance of austenitic high-nitrogen steels (AHNSs), which outperform CoCrMo alloys even under inflammatory conditions, we hypothesized that such steels will generate ultra-mild wear rates under gross slip fretting. While testing AHNSs against commercially available biomedical-grade materials of CoCrMo and TiAlV alloys, as well as zirconia-toughened alumina (ZTA) and against itself, it was found that AHNSs in combination with a Ti6Al4V alloy generated the smallest wear rate under gross slip fretting corrosion. This paper then discusses the wear behavior on the basis of ex situ analyses of the worn surfaces as to the acting wear mechanisms and submechanisms, as well as to the tribological reaction products.},

Thus, in this study, LUT-loaded nanogel (OVM-COS-LUT) was prepared by a self-assembly of ovomucin (OVM) and chitosan oligosaccharide (COS) to enhance the effective protection and bioavailability of LUT. The nanogel had excellent dispersion (PDI = 0.25) and an 89.96% LUT encapsulation rate. XRD crystal structure analysis confirmed that the encapsulated LUT maintained an amorphous morphology. In addition, the nanogel showed satisfactory stability with pH levels ranging from 2 to 9 and high ionic strengths (>100 mM). Even under long-term storage, the nanogel maintained an optimistic stabilization and protection capacity; its effective retention rates could reach 96.54%. In vitro, digestion simulation showed that the bioaccessibility and sustained release of OVM-COS-LUT nanogel was superior to that of free LUT. The nanogel provided significant antioxidant activity, and no significant harmful effects were detected in cytotoxicity analyses at higher concentrations. In summary, OVM-COS-LUT can be utilized as a potential safe oral and functional carrier for encapsulating LUT.},

ABSTRACT = {Angiogenesis is vital for bone fracture healing and plays a significant role in the fate of orthopedic implants. The growth and maintenance of new blood vessels at the fracture site of patients is essential, which promotes the clinical outcome of plasma sprayed Ti (PST) coated orthopedic implants. In order to endow the PST coating with pro-angiogenic effects, deferoxamine-loaded chitosan-based hydrogel was fabricated on the coating surface. Polydopamine-modified chitosan (CS/PDA) hydrogel exhibited enhanced bonding strength to PST coatings as evidenced by scratch test. The deferoxamine-loaded CS/PDA (CS/PDA-DFO) exhibited a sustained drug-release property, and the cumulative concentration of released DFO reached 20.21 μg/mL on day 7. PST-CS/PDA with higher wettability and active group quantity enhanced the viability and adhesion characteristics of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and upregulated the secretion level of nitric oxide and vascular endothelial growth factor. Moreover, the introduction of DFO in PST-CS/PDA further enhanced the pro-angiogenic effects. Above all, this study offers a novel approach for developing hydrogel coating on orthopedic implants showing enhanced bonding strength and pro-angiogenic effects.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper presents methods for developing high-performance interface electrode materials designed to enhance signal collection efficacy during long-term (over 24 h) electrocardiography (ECG) monitoring. The electrode materials are fabricated by integrating commercial ECG liquid hydrogels with carbon nanotubes (CNTs), which are widely utilized in dry-electrode technologies and extensively discussed in the current scientific literature. The composite materials are either prepared by dispersing CNTs within the commercial liquid hydrogel matrix or by encasing the hydrogels in macroscopic CNT films. Both approaches ensure the optimal wetting of the epidermis via the hydrogels, while the CNTs reduce material impedance and stabilize the drying process. The resulting electrode materials maintain their softness, allowing for micro-conformal skin attachment, and are biocompatible. Empirical testing confirms that the ECG electrodes employing these hybrid hydrogels adhere to relevant standards for durations exceeding 24 h. These innovative hybrid solutions merge the benefits of both wet and dry ECG electrode technologies, potentially facilitating the extended monitoring of ECG signals and thus advancing the diagnosis and treatment of various cardiac conditions.},

ABSTRACT = {Titanium with apatite-forming ability as well as antibacterial activity is useful as a component of antibacterial dental implants. When Ti was subjected to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), copper acetate (Cu(OAc)2), and heat (H2O2-Cu(OAc)2-heat) treatments, a network structure of anatase and rutile titanium dioxide (TiO2) and fine copper oxide (CuO) particles was formed on the Ti surface. The resulting samples accumulated a dense and uniform apatite layer on the surface when incubated in simulated body fluid and showed enhanced antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus under visible-light irradiation. Electron spin resonance spectra of H2O2-Cu(OAc)2-heat-treated samples showed that hydroxyl radicals (·OH) were generated from the samples, and the concentration of ·OH increased with increasing Cu concentration of the Cu(OAc)2 solution. The enhanced antibacterial activity of these samples under visible-light irradiation may be attributable to the generation of ·OH from samples. These results suggest that Ti implants obtained using H2O2-Cu(OAc)2-heat treatments and subjected to regular or on-demand visible-light irradiation may provide a decreased risk of peri-implantitis.},

ABSTRACT = {This study aimed to analyze the effect of the height of the proximal axial wall of the prepared tooth and the distance between the adjacent tooth and the prepared tooth on the scan accuracy of intraoral scanners. Ten working casts with maxillary first molars prepared to receive zirconia crowns were randomly obtained from a dental clinic. Each of the 10 casts was scanned using two intraoral scanners (i700; MEDIT and CS3600; Carestream; computer-aided design [CAD] test model, CTM; N = 15 per working cast) 15 times per scanner. Individual dies of the prepared teeth were fabricated, and high-precision scan data were acquired using a laboratory scanner (CAD reference model, CRM; N = 1). CTMs were aligned relative to the prepared tooth of CRMs by using three-dimensional inspection software (Ver 2018.1.0; Control X; 3D Systems). Data were statistically analyzed using an independent t-test and one-way analysis of variance for between-group comparisons (α = 0.05). The inaccuracy in the proximal regions (mesial or distal) of the prepared tooth was higher than that in the buccal and lingual regions (p < 0.05). The scan accuracy was not correlated with the variables when the distance between the adjacent tooth and the prepared tooth was ≥2.0 mm and the height of the proximal axial wall of the prepared tooth was <3.0 mm (p > 0.05). Therefore, an excellent scan accuracy can be obtained using an intraoral scanner when the distance between the adjacent tooth and the prepared tooth is ≥2.0 mm and the proximal axial wall height of the prepared tooth is <3.0 mm.},

ABSTRACT = {The in vitro evaluation of 3D scaffolds for bone tissue engineering in mono-cultures is a common practice; however, it does not represent the native complex nature of bone tissue. Co-cultures of osteoblasts and osteoclasts, without the addition of stimulating agents for monitoring cellular cross-talk, remains a challenge. In this study, a growth factor-free co-culture of human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hBM-MSCs) and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (hPBMCs) has been established and used for the evaluation of 3D-printed scaffolds for bone tissue engineering. The scaffolds were produced from PLLA/PCL/PHBV polymeric blends, with two composite materials produced through the addition of 2.5% w/v nanohydroxyapatite (nHA) or strontium-substituted nanohydroxyapatite (Sr-nHA). Cell morphology data showed that hPBMCs remained undifferentiated in co-culture, while no obvious differences were observed in the mono- and co-cultures of hBM-MSCs. A significantly increased alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and osteogenic gene expression was observed in co-culture on Sr-nHA-containing scaffolds. Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) activity and osteoclastogenic gene expression displayed significantly suppressed levels in co-culture on Sr-nHA-containing scaffolds. Interestingly, mono-cultures of hPBMCs on Sr-nHA-containing scaffolds indicated a delay in osteoclasts formation, as evidenced from TRAP activity and gene expression, demonstrating that strontium acts as an osteoclastogenesis inhibitor. This co-culture study presents an effective 3D model to evaluate the regenerative capacity of scaffolds for bone tissue engineering, thus minimizing time-consuming and costly in vivo experiments.},

ABSTRACT = {Cargo encapsulation through emulsion-based methods has been pondered over the years. Although several microemulsification techniques have been employed for the microcapsule’s synthesis, there are still no clear guidelines regarding the suitability of one technique over the others or the impacts on the morphological and physicochemical stability of the final particles. Therefore, in this systematic study, we investigated the influence of synthesis parameters on the fabrication of emulsion-based microcapsules concerning morphological and physicochemical properties. Using poly(urea-formaldehyde) (PUF) microcapsules as a model system, and after determining the optimal core/shell ratio, we tested three different microemulsification techniques (magnetic stirring, ultrasonication, and mechanical stirring) and two different cargo types (100% TEGDMA (Triethylene glycol dimethacrylate) and 80% TEGDMA + 20% DMAM (N,N-Dimethylacrylamide)). The resulting microcapsules were characterized via optical and scanning electron microscopies, followed by size distribution analysis. The encapsulation efficiency was obtained through the extraction method, and the percentage reaction yield was calculated. Physicochemical properties were assessed by incubating the microcapsules under different osmotic pressures for 1 day and 1, 2, or 4 weeks. The data were analyzed statistically with one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s tests (α = 0.05). Overall, the mechanical stirring resulted in the most homogeneous and stable microcapsules, with an increased reaction yield from 100% to 50% in comparison with ultrasonication and magnetic methods, respectively. The average microcapsule diameter ranged from 5 to 450 µm, with the smallest ones in the ultrasonication and the largest ones in the magnetic stirring groups. The water affinities of the encapsulated cargo influenced the microcapsule formation and stability, with the incorporation of DMAM leading to more homogeneous and stable microcapsules. Environmental osmotic pressure led to cargo loss or the selective swelling of the shells. In summary, this systematic investigation provides insights and highlights commonly overlooked factors that can influence microcapsule fabrication and guide the choice based on a diligent analysis of therapeutic niche requirements.},

ABSTRACT = {Titanium continues to be the gold standard in the field of osteosynthesis materials. This also applies to pediatric craniofacial surgery. Various resorbable materials have already been developed in order to avoid costly and risky second operations to remove metal in children. However, none of these resorbable materials have been able to completely replace the previous gold standard, titanium, in a satisfactory manner. This has led to the need for a new resorbable osteosynthesis material that fulfills the requirements for biocompatibility, stability, and uniform resorption. In our previous in vitro and in vivo work, we were able to show that molybdenum fulfills these requirements. To further confirm these results, we conducted a proof of concept in four domestic pigs, each of which was implanted with a resorbable molybdenum implant. The animals were then examined daily for local inflammatory parameters. After 54 days, the animals were euthanized with subsequent computer tomography imaging. We also removed the implants together with the surrounding tissue and parts of the spleen, liver, and kidney for histopathological evaluation. The molybdenum implants were also analyzed metallographically and using scanning electron microscopy. A blood sample was taken pre- and post-operatively. None of the animals showed clinical signs of inflammation over the entire test period. Histopathologically, good tissue compatibility was found. Early signs of degradation were observed after 54 days, which were not sufficient for major resorption. Resorption is expected with longer in situ residence times based on results of similar earlier investigations.},

ABSTRACT = {Objective: Dental hypersensitivity remains widespread, underscoring the need for materials that can effectively seal dental tubules. This study evaluated the potential of bioactive-glass-infused hydroxyethyl cellulose gels in this context. Methods: Five gels were synthesized, each containing 20% bioactive glass (specifically, 45S5, S53P4, Biomin F, and Biomin C), with an additional blank gel serving as a control. Subjected to two months of accelerated aging at 37 ± 2 °C, these gels were assessed for key properties: viscosity, water disintegration time, pH level, consistency, adhesion to glass, and element release capability. Results: Across the board, the gels facilitated the release of calcium, phosphate, and silicon ions, raising the pH from 9.00 ± 0.10 to 9.7 ± 0.0—a range conducive to remineralization. Dissolution in water occurred within 30–50 min post-application. Viscosity readings showed variability, with 45S5 reaching 6337 ± 24 mPa/s and Biomin F at 3269 ± 18 mPa/s after two months. Initial adhesion for the blank gel was measured at 0.27 ± 0.04 Pa, increasing to 0.73 ± 0.06 Pa for the others over time. Gels can release elements upon contact with water (Ca− Biomin C 104.8 ± 15.7 mg/L; Na− Biomin F 76.30 ± 11.44 mg/L; P− Biomin C 2.623 ± 0.393 mg/L; Si− 45S5-45.15 ± 6.77mg/L, F− Biomin F− 3.256 ± 0.651mg/L; Cl− Biomin C 135.5 ± 20.3 mg/L after 45 min). Conclusions: These findings highlight the gels’ capacity to kickstart the remineralization process by delivering critical ions needed for enamel layer reconstruction. Further exploration in more dynamic, real-world conditions is recommended to fully ascertain their practical utility.},

ABSTRACT = {This study aims to develop multi-functional bio-safe dental resin composites with capabilities for mineralization, high in vitro biocompatibility, and anti-biofilm properties. To address this issue, experimental resin composites consisting of UDMA/TEGDMA-based dental resins and low quantities (1.9, 3.8, and 7.7 vol%) of 45S5 bioactive glass (BAG) particles were developed. To evaluate cellular responses of resin composites, MC3T3-E1 cells were (1) exposed to the original composites extracts, (2) cultured directly on the freshly cured resin composites, or (3) cultured on preconditioned composites that have been soaked in deionized water (DI water), a cell culture medium (MEM), or a simple HEPES-containing artificial remineralization promotion (SHARP) solution for 14 days. Cell adhesion, cell viability, and cell differentiation were, respectively, assessed. In addition, the anti-biofilm properties of BAG-loaded resin composites regarding bacterial viability, biofilm thickness, and biofilm morphology, were assessed for the first time. In vitro biological results demonstrated that cell metabolic activity and ALP expression were significantly diminished when subjected to composite extracts or direct contact with the resin composites containing BAG fillers. However, after the preconditioning treatments in MEM and SHARP solutions, the biomimetic calcium phosphate minerals on 7.7 vol% BAG-loaded composites revealed unimpaired or even better cellular processes, including cell adhesion, cell proliferation, and early cell differentiation. Furthermore, resin composites with 1.9, 3.8, and 7.7 vol% BAG could not only reduce cell viability in S. mutans biofilm on the composite surface but also reduce the biofilm thickness and bacterial aggregations. This phenomenon was more evident in BAG7.7 due to the high ionic osmotic pressure and alkaline microenvironment caused by BAG dissolution. This study concludes that multi-functional bio-safe resin composites with mineralization and anti-biofilm properties can be achieved by adding low quantities of BAG into the resin system, which offers promising abilities to mineralize as well as prevent caries without sacrificing biological activity.},

ABSTRACT = {Preclinical and clinical research on two-piece zirconia implants are warranted. Therefore, we evaluated the in vitro fracture resistance of such a zirconia oral implant system. The present study comprised 32 two-piece zirconia implants and abutments attached to the implants using a titanium (n = 16) or a zirconia abutment screw (n = 16). Both groups were subdivided (n = 8): group T-0 comprised implants with a titanium abutment screw and no artificial loading; group T-HL was the titanium screw group exposed to hydro-thermomechanical loading in a chewing simulator; group Z-0 was the zirconia abutment screw group with no artificial loading; and group Z-HL comprised the zirconia screw group with hydro-thermomechanical loading. Groups T-HL and Z-HL were loaded with 98 N and aged in 85 °C hot water for 107 chewing cycles. All samples were loaded to fracture. Kruskal–Wallis tests were executed to assess the loading/bending moment group differences. The significance level was established at a probability of 0.05. During the artificial loading, there was a single occurrence of an implant fracture. The mean fracture resistances measured in a universal testing machine were 749 N for group T-0, 828 N for group Z-0, 652 N for group T-HL, and 826 N for group Z-HL. The corresponding bending moments were as follows: group T-0, 411 Ncm; group Z-0, 452 Ncm; group T-HL, 356 Ncm; and group Z-HL, 456 Ncm. There were no statistically significant differences found between the experimental groups. Therefore, the conclusion was that loading and aging did not diminish the fracture resistance of the evaluated implant system.},

ABSTRACT = {The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of local administration of melatonin (MLT) on molecular biomarkers and calvaria bone critical defects in female rats with or without osteoporosis, associated or not with a xenogeneic biomaterial. Forty-eight female rats were randomly divided into two groups: (O) ovariectomized and (S) placebo groups. After 45 days of osteoporosis induction, two critical-size defects (5 mm diameter) were created on the calvaria. The groups were subdivided according to the following treatment: (C) Clot, MLT, MLT associated with Bio-Oss® (MLTBO), and Bio-Oss® (BO). After 45 days, the defect samples were collected and processed for microtomography, histomorphometry, and biomolecular analysis (Col-I, BMP-2, and OPN). All animals had one femur harvested to confirm the osteoporosis. Microtomography analysis demonstrated a bone mineral density reduction in the O group. Regarding bone healing, the S group presented greater filling of the defects than the O group; however, in the O group, the defects treated with MLT showed higher mineral filling than the other treatments. There was no difference between the treatments performed in the S group (p = 0.05). Otherwise, O-MLT had neoformed bone higher than in the other groups (p = 0.05). The groups that did not receive biomaterial demonstrated lower levels of Col-I secretion; S-MLT and S-MLTBO presented higher levels of OPN, while O-C presented statistically lower results (p < 0.05); O-BO showed greater BMP-2 secretion (p < 0.05). In the presence of ovariectomy-induced osteoporosis, MLT treatment increased the newly formed bone area, regulated the inflammatory response, and increased OPN expression.},

ABSTRACT = {Resin infiltration is an effective method to mask vestibular white spots. If needed, external bleaching is usually recommended before infiltration, whilst in clinical practice, this sequence may not always be feasible. This in vitro study evaluated the effect of bleaching after resin infiltration regarding surface roughness and color using bovine incisors. Unlike for the untreated specimens (control, n = 25), artificial caries lesions were created within the test group (n = 25) using a demineralization solution at 37 °C for five days (pH = 4.95). The lesions were subsequently infiltrated using a resin infiltrant (Icon, DMG, Hamburg, Germany), followed by polishing. Afterwards, all specimens were bleached with a 10% carbamide peroxide gel (Opalescence, Ultradent, South Jordan, UT, USA) for 8 h/day over a ten-day period. Between bleaching treatments, specimens were stored in an opaque container with moistened paper tissues at 37 °C. Surface roughness was measured using a profilometer, and color in the L*a*b* space was assessed spectrophotometrically before and after bleaching. Bleaching increased the L*-values of both infiltrated (mean ± SD; ΔL* = 3.52 ± 1.98) and untreated (control) specimens (ΔL* = 3.53 ± 2.30) without any significant difference between the groups (p = 0.983). Bleaching also induced a significant increase in the mean surface roughness of both infiltrated (p < 0.001) and untreated (p = 0.0134) teeth. In terms of clinical relevance; it can be concluded that bleaching resin-infiltrated enamel is as effective as bleaching sound enamel.},

ABSTRACT = {Treating severe dermal disruptions often presents significant challenges. Recent advancements have explored biological cell sprays as a promising treatment, but their success hinges on efficient cell delivery and complete wound coverage. This requires a good spray distribution with a small droplet size, high particle number, and ample surface coverage. The type of nozzle used with the spray device can impact these parameters. To evaluate the influence of different nozzles on spray characteristics, we compared air-assisted and unassisted nozzles. The unassisted nozzle displayed small particle size, high particle number, good overall coverage, high cell viability, preserved cell metabolic activity, and low cytotoxicity. Air-assisted nozzles did not perform well regarding cell viability and metabolic activity. Flow visualization analysis comparing two different unassisted nozzles using high-speed imaging (100 kHz frame rate) revealed a tulip-shaped spray pattern, indicating optimal spray distribution. High-speed imaging showed differences between the unassisted nozzles. One unassisted nozzle displayed a bi-modal distribution of the droplet diameter while the other unassisted nozzle displayed a mono-modal distribution. These findings demonstrate the critical role of nozzle selection in successful cell delivery. A high-quality, certified nozzle manufactured for human application omits the need for an air-assisted nozzle and provides a simple system to use with similar or better performance characteristics than those of an air-assisted system.},

However, the application and manufacturing of nano-adjuvant is hampered by its challenging scale-up, poor reproducibility, and low security. Therefore, the present study aimed to optimize the preparation nanoparticles (NPs) using FDA-approved biopolymer materials poly(lactic acid) (PLA) and cationic lipid didodecyl-dimethyl-ammonium bromide (DDAB), develop the scale-up process, and evaluate the stability and biosafety of it. The optimum preparation conditions of DDAB/PLA NPs on a small scale were as follows: DDAB amount of 30 mg, aqueous phase volume of 90 mL, stirring rate at 550 rpm, and solidifying time of 12 h. Under the optimum conditions, the size of the NPs was about 170 nm. In scale-up preparation experiments, the vacuum rotary evaporation of 6 h and the Tangential flow ultrafiltration (TFU) method were the optimum conditions. The results suggested that DDAB/PLA NPs exhibited a uniform particle size distribution, with an average size of 150.3 ± 10.4 nm and a narrow polydispersity index (PDI) of 0.090 ± 0.13, coupled with a high antigen loading capacity of 85.4 ± 4.0%. In addition, the DDAB/PLA NPs can be stored stably for 30 days and do not have side effects caused by residual solvents. For biosafety, the acute toxicity experiments showed good tolerance of the vaccine formulation even at a high adjuvant dose. The local irritation experiment demonstrated the reversibility of muscular irritation, and the repeated toxicity experiment revealed no significant necrosis or severe lesions in mice injected with the high-dose vaccine formulation. Overall, the DDAB/PLA NPs exhibit potential for clinical translation as a safe candidate vaccine adjuvant.},

ABSTRACT = {Probiotic microorganisms are used in a variety of food supplements and medical formulations to promote human health. In periodontal therapy, probiotics are mainly used in the form of gels, tablets or rinses that often tend to leak from the periodontal pocket, resulting in a strongly reduced therapeutic effect. In this pilot in vitro study, we present biodegradable alginate-based particles as an alternative, highly efficient system for a periodontal delivery of probiotic bacteria to the inflammation site. For this purpose, Lactococcus (L.) lactis was encapsulated using a standardized pump-controlled extrusion-dripping method. Time-dependent bacterial release in artificial saliva was investigated over 9 days. The effect of freeze drying was explored to ensure long-term storage of L. lactis-loaded particles. Additionally, the particles were bound to dentin surface using approved bioadhesives and subjected to shear stress in a hydrodynamic flow chamber that mimics the oral cavity in vitro. Thus, round particles within the range of 0.80–1.75 mm in radius could be produced, whereby the diameter of the dripping tip had the most significant impact on the size. Although both small and large particles demonstrated a similar release trend of L. lactis, the release rate was significantly higher in the former. Following lyophilization, particles could restore their original shape within 4 h in artificial saliva; thereby, the bacterial viability was not affected. The attachment strength to dentin intensified by an adhesive could resist forces between 10 and 25 N/m2. Full degradation of the particles was observed after 20 days in artificial saliva. Therefore, alginate particles display a valuable probiotic carrier for periodontal applications that have several crucial advantages over existing preparations: a highly stable form, prolonged continuous release of therapeutic bacteria, precise manufacturing according to required dimensions at the application site, strong attachment to the tooth with low risk of dislocation, high biocompatibility and biodegradability.},

ABSTRACT = {(1) Background: currently, the advantages of bulk-fill resin composite and high-viscosity glass ionomer materials have increased their use in dentistry; accordingly, their mechanical, surface, and optical properties have become more important. This study aimed to evaluate the mechanical, surface, and optical properties of three different restorative materials (a high-viscosity bulk-fill resin composite (TNC), a flowable bulk-fill resin composite (EBF), and a high-viscosity glass ionomer (FIX)) after application using different techniques (control, heat application, and ultrasonic activation). (2) Methods: specimens were prepared to assess the color stability and surface roughness (n = 12). The specimens were immersed in two different solutions for 14 days. For the compressive strength test, specimens were prepared using a Teflon mold (n = 12). (3) Results: among the specimens applied according to the manufacturer’s instructions and immersed in distilled water, it was observed that the surface roughness values of FIX on the 7th day were statistically significantly higher than the other materials (p < 0.05). The compressive strength values of EBF applied using ultrasonic activation were significantly lower than those of EBF applied using the other techniques (p < 0.05). (4) Conclusions: coffee can negatively affect the color stability of restorative materials, but discoloration may vary depending on differences in the content of the material. All materials evaluated in this study exhibited clinically acceptable surface roughness values. It can be concluded that flowable bulk-fill resin composite is the most durable material in terms of compressive strength, so it can be used in the restoration of posterior teeth, especially those exposed to intensive stress.},

ABSTRACT = {This study aimed to compare the impact of CAD/CAM closed systems and open systems on the marginal gap of monolithic zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate (ZLS) ceramic crowns, as both systems are used in everyday dentistry, both chair-side and laboratory. For the closed system, 20 plastic teeth were scanned by a Primescan intra-oral scanner (IOS), and for the open system, the same number of plastic teeth were scanned by Trios 4 IOS. For the closed system, CEREC software was used, and for the open system, EXOCAD software was used. All 40 ZLS crowns were grinded by the same four-axis machine and cemented with Temp-bond, followed by self-adhesive resin cement. For each type of cement, an evaluation of the marginal gap was conducted by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Before comparisons between the groups, a Kolmogorov–Smirnov test was performed on the study variables showing a normal distribution (p > 0.05). Independent T tests (α = 0.05) and paired-sample T tests (α = 0.05) were used. The independent T test found no significant mean marginal gap differences in the zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate crowns bonded with Temp-bond and scanned by Primescan (28.09 μm ± 3.06) compared to Trios 4 (28.94 μm ± 3.30) (p = 0.401), and there was no significant mean marginal gap differences in zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate crowns bonded with self-adhesive resin cement (Gcem ONE) and scanned by Primescan (46.70 μm ± 3.80) compared to Trios 4 (47.79 μm ± 2.59) (p = 0.295). Paired-sample T tests showed significantly higher mean marginal gaps with Gcem ONE compared to Temp-bond for the total mean marginal gap when scanning with Primescan (p = 0.0005) or Trios 4 (p = 0.0005). In everyday dentistry, both closed systems (Primescan with Cerec) and open systems (Trios 4 with Exocad) can be used to achieve an acceptable (<120 µm) marginal gap for ZLS CELTRA® DUO single crowns. There is a significant difference between cementation with Temp-bond and Gcem ONE self-adhesive resin cement (p < 0.05).},

ABSTRACT = {There is a vast amount of published literature concerning dental veneers; however, the effects of tooth preparation, aging, veneer type, and resin cement type on the failure of dental veneers in laboratory versus clinical scenarios are not clear. The purpose of the present narrative review was to determine the principal factors associated with failures of dental veneers in laboratory tests and to understand how these factors translate into clinical successes/failures. Articles were identified and screened by the lead author in January 2024 using the keywords ‘‘dental veneer”, “complication”, “survival rate”, “failure”, and “success rate” using PubMed/Medline, Scopus, Google Scholar, and Science Direct. The inclusion criteria included articles published between January 1999 and January 2024 on the topics of preparation of a tooth, aging processes of the resin cement and veneer, translucency, thickness, fabrication technique of the veneer; shade, and thickness of the resin cement. The exclusion criteria included articles that discussed marginal and internal fit, microhardness, water sorption, solubility, polishability, occlusal veneers, retention, surface treatments, and wear. The results of the present review indicated that dental veneers generally have a high survival rate (>90% for more than 10 years). The amount of preserved enamel layer plays a paramount role in the survival and success rates of veneers, and glass-ceramic veneers with minimal/no preparation showed the highest survival rates. Fracture was the primary failure mechanism associated with decreased survival rate, followed by debonding and color change. Fractures increased in the presence of parafunctional activities. Fewer endodontic complications were associated with veneer restorations. No difference was observed between the maxillary and mandibular teeth. Clinical significance: Fractures can be reduced by evaluation of occlusion immediately after cementation and through the use of high-strength veneer materials, resin cements with low moduli, and thin layers of highly polished veneers. Debonding failures can be reduced with minimal/no preparation, and immediate dentin sealing should be considered when dentin is exposed. Debonding can also be reduced by preventing contamination from blood, saliva, handpiece oil, or fluoride-containing polishing paste; through proper surface treatment (20 s of hydrofluoric acid etching for glass ceramic followed by silane for 60 s); and through use of light-cured polymerization for thin veneers. Long-term color stability may be maintained using resin cements with UDMA-based resin, glass ceramic materials, and light-cure polymerization with thin veneers.},

ABSTRACT = {The aim of this study is to analyze the resorption rate of bone graft materials after crestal sinus floor elevation, study its influencing factors, and improve the long-term success rate of implants after crestal maxillary sinus floor elevation. Measurement and analysis were conducted at six postoperative timepoints (0 months, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, 24 months, and 30 months) using cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) data on 31 patients from the Chenghuaxinguanghua Dental Clinic who underwent crestal maxillary sinus floor elevation, involving 38 graft sites. The materials resorption rates of the bone graft height (BH) and bone graft width (BW) were assessed. BH and BW resorption rates followed the same trend (p = 0.07), with BH and BW resorption rates decreasing with time (rBH = −0.32, p < 0.01; rBW = −0.18, p < 0.01), and were maximal in the 0–6 month interval, with BH and BW resorption rates of 3.42%/mth and 3.03%/mth, respectively. The average monthly BH and BW resorption rates in the 6–12 month interval rapidly decreased to 1.75%/mth and 1.29%/mth, respectively. The monthly BH and BW resorption rates in the 12–30 month intervals stabilized at 1.45%/mth (p > 0.05) and 1.22%/mth (p > 0.05), respectively. The higher the initial bone graft height (BH0), the lower the BH resorption rates (rBH = −0.98, p < 0.05), and the BW resorption rate was different for different graft sites (p = 0.01). The resorption rates of bone graft materials implanted through crestal maxillary sinus floor elevation decreased rapidly within the first 12 months post operation and remained stable after 12 months. BH0 was identified as a significant factor influencing the resorption rates of bone graft materials. These results could suggest dentists should pay attention to the trend of resorption rates over time and carefully manage the initial height of bone grafts and inspire the research of new bone grafting materials for crestal maxillary sinus floor elevation.},

ABSTRACT = {This study aimed to assess the adaptability and penetration depth capacity of recent bioceramic systems, including regular EndoSequence (BC) versus HiFlow (BCH) sealers in the presence of BC points. A total of 54 single-rooted teeth were instrumented and obturated with either the cold or warm compaction technique (n = 9), using either BC, BCH, or AH Plus (AHP) combined with BC points. The adaptation, film thickness, and gaps/voids were evaluated by scanning electron microscopy. The sealer/dentin interface was evaluated by Raman spectroscopy, and depth penetration was evaluated by a confocal laser scanning microscope. According to the normality test, the data were statistically analyzed by ANOVA or Kruskal–Wallis and Mann–Whitney U tests at p < 0.05. BCH sealer showed the significantly thinnest film with the greatest flow (p > 0.001), with further improvement when subjected to the warm compaction technique. Moreover, it exhibited close adaptation with deep penetration into radicular dentin, forming a tag-like structure. The Raman spectra also indicated close contact with the dentin surface. The use of BC sealer with BC points exhibited homogenous, single-unit obturation, either with a cold or warm technique. Furthermore, the use of the warm compaction technique with BCH sealer achieved a gap-free interface associated with tag-like structures, which exhibit the monoblock phenomenon.},

ABSTRACT = {Biodegradable vascular stents (BVS) are deemed as great potential alternatives for overcoming the inherent limitations of permanent metallic stents in the treatment of coronary artery diseases. The current study aimed to comprehensively compare the mechanical behaviors of four poly(lactic acid) (PLA) BVS designs with varying geometries via numerical methods and to clarify the optimal BVS selection. Four PLA BVS (i.e., Absorb, DESolve, Igaki-Tamai, and Fantom) were first constructed. A degradation model was refined by simply including the fatigue effect induced by pulsatile blood pressures, and an explicit solver was employed to simulate the crimping and degradation behaviors of the four PLA BVS. The degradation dynamics here were characterized by four indices. The results indicated that the stent designs affected crimping and degradation behaviors. Compared to the other three stents, the DESolve stent had the greatest radial stiffness in the crimping simulation and the best diameter maintenance ability despite its faster degradation; moreover, the stent was considered to perform better according to a pilot scoring system. The current work provides a theoretical method for studying and understanding the degradation dynamics of the PLA BVS, and it could be helpful for the design of next-generation BVS.},

ABSTRACT = {Skin and soft tissue reconstruction has long been based on the reconstructive ladder. However, a skin substitute has become popular due to its predictable outcomes, without donor-site morbidity. The biodegradable temporizing matrix (BTM; NovoSorb, PolyNovo Ltd., Port Melbourne, Australia) is a synthetic skin substitute that has recently gained its clinical application. Compared with those of other dermal templates, the clinical efficacy and performance of the BTM are not well established, especially among the Asian population. This study aims to share our experience and strategy of using BTM in various wound conditions. The data of patients who underwent skin and soft tissue reconstruction with BTM at a single institution between January 2022 and December 2023 were reviewed. The patient demographics, wound characteristics, surgical details, secondary procedures, and complications were recorded and analyzed. Postoperative 6-month photographs were collected and independently evaluated by two plastic surgeons and two wound care center nurses using the Manchester Scar Scale (MSS). This study included 37 patients, consisting of 22 males and 15 females with a mean age of 51.8 years (range, 18–86 years old). The wound etiologies included trauma (67.6%), necrotizing soft tissue infection (16.2%), burns (10.8%), toe gangrene (2.7%), and scar excision (2.7%). The average wound area covered by BTM was 50.6 ± 47.6 cm2. Among the patients, eight received concomitant flap surgery and BTM implantation, 20 (54.1%) underwent subsequent split-thickness skin grafts (STSG), and 17 had small wounds (mean: 21.6 cm2) healed by secondary intention. Infection was the most common complication, affecting six patients (n = 6 [16.2%]), five of whom were treated conservatively, and only one required debridement. Thirty-three patients (89.2%) had good BTM take, and only four had BTM failure, requiring further reconstruction. At the last follow-up, 35 out of the 37 patients (94.6%) achieved successful wound closure, and the total MSS score was 10.44 ± 2.94, indicating a satisfactory scar condition. The patients who underwent BTM grafting without STSG had better scar scores than those who received STSG (8.71 ± 2.60 vs. 11.18 ± 2.84, p = 0.039). In conclusion, the BTM is effective and feasible in treating various wounds, with relatively low complication rates, and it can thus be considered as an alternative for skin and soft tissue reconstruction. When combined with adipofasical flap reconstruction, it achieves a more comprehensive anatomical restoration.},

ABSTRACT = {A Lactococcus (L.) lactis strain producing antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory biomolecules (mainly 1,4-Diaza-2,5-dioxobicyclo[4.3.0]nonanes and pyrazine-derivatives) was tested for its capacity to cure clinical endometritis in buffaloes compared to conventional antibiotic-based treatment. Clinical endometritis-diagnosed buffaloes (n = 16/group) were infused intrauterine with four doses of 109 CFU-free (FLC group) or nanoencapsulated L. lactis (NLC group) and compared to those that received three doses of saline + a single dose of 500 mg cephapirin benzathin (AB group) or four doses of saline (control, C group) every other day. Endometrium samples were analyzed for cytological (polymorphonuclear cells, PMN), bacteriological, and proinflammatory mRNA expression. Uterine wash and blood samples were collected to determine proinflammatory cytokine concentrations and metabolites in the blood samples. The reproductive performance of buffaloes was assessed. Compared to the C group, the AB and NLC groups had the lowest percentage of PMN, followed by those in the FLC group (p < 0.05). All treated buffaloes had significantly lower numbers of pathogens than the control buffaloes. Compared to control, all treatments significantly down-regulated endometrial proinflammatory encoding mRNA expression. The concentrations of IL1B, TNFAIP7, and leukocyte esterase activity in the uterine washings were significantly decreased in the AB and NLC groups compared to the C and FLC groups. All treatments significantly decreased concentrations of serum proinflammatory cytokines compared to control. Both the AB and NLC groups had significantly lower concentrations of serum NEFA than the C and FLC groups. The percentage of control buffaloes having an echogenic uterus and PVD score > 2 was significantly higher than those in the treated buffaloes with higher numbers of corpora lutea, higher conception rates, and shorter days open than control buffaloes (p < 0.05). In conclusion, L. lactis-producing antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory metabolites reduce uterine inflammatory responses and improve fertility in buffaloes.},

ABSTRACT = {Effective root canal disinfection and the subsequent release of natural growth factors from dentin are crucial to the success of regenerative endodontic procedures. This study evaluated the effect of newly introduced calcium silicate-based temporary intracanal medicament Bio-C Temp and calcium hydroxide-based material UltraCal XS on the release of transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) from root canal dentin. Twenty-two intact and fully developed human premolars from patients aged 15–18 were shaped and irrigated according to the current clinical recommendations. The teeth were then gently split in half, and the root canal dentin of paired samples was covered with Bio-C Temp or UltraCal XS. After 3 weeks of incubation, the specimens were conditioned with 17% EDTA and the collected solution was subjected to the quantification of the released TGF-β1 by performing an ELISA. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by Tukey’s test, was selected to determine the statistically significant differences between the groups at the 0.95 confidence level. The highest mean value of released TGF-β1 (1993.1 pg/mL) was detected in the control group, where the root canal dentin was conditioned with 17% EDTA alone. Regarding the experimental groups, Bio-C Temp released a statistically significantly higher amount of TGF-β1 (282.14 pg/mL) compared to UltraCal XS (114.28 pg/mL; p = 0.0158). Bio-C Temp affected the release of growth factors from root canal dentin less than UltraCal XS and may therefore serve as an intracanal medicament for regenerative endodontic procedures.},

ABSTRACT = {Tissue engineering aims to develop bionic scaffolds as alternatives to autologous vascular grafts due to their limited availability. This study introduces a novel wet-electrospinning fabrication technique to create small-diameter, uniformly aligned tubular scaffolds. By combining this innovative method with conventional electrospinning, a bionic tri-layer scaffold that mimics the zonal structure of vascular tissues is produced. The inner and outer layers consist of PCL/Gelatin and PCL/PLGA fibers, respectively, while the middle layer is crafted using PCL through Wet Vertical Magnetic Rod Electrospinning (WVMRE). The scaffold’s morphology is analyzed using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) to confirm its bionic structure. The mechanical properties, degradation profile, wettability, and biocompatibility of the scaffold are also characterized. To enhance hemocompatibility, the scaffold is crosslinked with heparin. The results demonstrate sufficient mechanical properties, good wettability of the inner layer, proper degradability of the inner and middle layers, and overall good biocompatibility. In conclusion, this study successfully develops a small-diameter tri-layer tubular scaffold that meets the required specifications.},

ABSTRACT = {The recombinant structural protein described in this study was designed based on sequences derived from elastin and silk. Silk–elastin hybrid copolymers are characterized by high solubility while maintaining high product flexibility. The phase transition temperature from aqueous solution to hydrogel, as well as other physicochemical and mechanical properties of such particles, can differ significantly depending on the number of sequence repeats. We present a preliminary characterization of the EJ17zipR protein obtained in high yield in a prokaryotic expression system and efficiently purified via a multistep process. Its addition significantly improves biomaterial’s rheological and mechanical properties, especially elasticity. As a result, EJ17zipR appears to be a promising component for bioinks designed to print spatially complex structures that positively influence both shape retention and the internal transport of body fluids. The results of biological studies indicate that the addition of the studied protein creates a favorable microenvironment for cell adhesion, growth, and migration.},
