The hyoid is the only bone in the human body that is completely independent, not forming a joint with any other bone; its position is maintained by the suprahyoid and infrahyoid muscles, as well as several ligaments. The purpose of this study was to ascertain the effect of the functional pressure arising from these muscles and ligaments on the hyoid body structure from its bone mineral density, bone quality, and histological observations. The area between the mesial-most part of each lesser horn and the center of the hyoid body was divided equally into four measurement regions. We conducted histological investigations at each measurement region and observed the entheses. To analyze bone mass and bone quality, we also measured bone mineral density (BMD) and analyzed biological apatite (BAp) crystallite orientation in the same regions. Histological observations identified periosteal insertions and fibrocartilaginous entheses. There was no significant difference in BMD between any of the measurement regions, but the preferential orientation of BAp crystallites was stronger in the infrahyoid muscles and ligaments, where fibrocartilaginous entheses are found, than in other places. This suggests that the functional pressure at these sites might exert a major effect not only on the morphological characteristics of the entheses but also on bone quality.
