 abstract = {Periodontal diseases involve injuries to the supporting structures of the tooth and, if left untreated, can lead to the loss of the tooth. Regenerative periodontal therapies aim, ideally, at healing all the damaged periodontal tissues and represent a significant clinical and societal challenge for the current ageing population. This review provides a picture of the currently-used biomaterials for periodontal regeneration, including natural and synthetic polymers, bioceramics (e.g., calcium phosphates and bioactive glasses), and composites. Bioactive materials aim at promoting the regeneration of new healthy tissue. Polymers are often used as barrier materials in guided tissue regeneration strategies and are suitable both to exclude epithelial down-growth and to allow periodontal ligament and alveolar bone cells to repopulate the defect. The problems related to the barrier postoperative collapse can be solved by using a combination of polymeric membranes and grafting materials. Advantages and drawbacks associated with the incorporation of growth factors and nanomaterials in periodontal scaffolds are also discussed, along with the development of multifunctional and multilayer implants. Tissue-engineering strategies based on functionally-graded scaffolds are expected to play an ever-increasing role in the management of periodontal defects.},

 abstract = {Cell scaffolds are often used in cell transplantation as they provide a solid structural support to implanted cells and can be bioengineered to mimic the native extracellular matrix. Gadolinium fluoride nanoparticles (Gd-NPs) as a contrast agent for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) were incorporated into poly(lactide-co-glycolide)/chitosan scaffolds to obtain Imaging Labelled Cell Scaffolds (ILCSs), having the shape of hollow spherical/ellipsoidal particles (200–600 μm diameter and 50–80 μm shell thickness). While Gd-NPs incorporated into microparticles do not provide any contrast enhancement in T1-weighted (T1w) MR images, ILCSs can release Gd-NPs in a controlled manner, thus activating MRI contrast. ILCSs seeded with human mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSCs) were xenografted subcutaneously into either immunocompromised and immunocompetent mice without any immunosuppressant treatments, and the transplants were followed-up in vivo by MRI for 18 days. Immunocompromised mice showed a progressive activation of MRI contrast within the implants due to the release of Gd-NPs in the extracellular matrix. Instead, immunocompetent mice showed poor activation of MRI contrast due to the encapsulation of ILCSs within fibrotic capsules and to the scavenging of released Gd-NPs by phagocytic cells. In conclusion, the MRI follow-up of cell xenografts can report the host cell response to the xenograft. However, it does not strictly report on the viability of transplanted hMSCs.},

 abstract = {Phosphoserine modified cements (PMC) exhibit unique properties, including strong adhesion to tissues and biomaterials. While TTCP-PMCs remodel into bone in vivo, little is known regarding the bioactivity and physiochemical changes that occur during resorption. In the present study, changes in the mechanical strength and composition were evaluated for 28 days, for three formulations of αTCP based PMCs. PMCs were significantly stronger than unmodified cement (38–49 MPa vs. 10 MPa). Inclusion of wollastonite in PMCs appeared to accelerate the conversion to hydroxyapatite, coincident with slight decrease in strength. In non-wollastonite PMCs the initial compressive strength did not change after 28 days in PBS (p > 0.99). Dissolution/degradation of PMC was evaluated in acidic (pH 2.7, pH 4.0), and supersaturated fluids (simulated body fluid (SBF)). PMCs exhibited comparable mass loss (<15%) after 14 days, regardless of pH and ionic concentration. Electron microscopy, infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray analysis revealed that significant amounts of brushite, octacalcium phosphate, and hydroxyapatite reprecipitated, following dissolution in acidic conditions (pH 2.7), while amorphous calcium phosphate formed in SBF. In conclusion, PMC surfaces remodel into metastable precursors to hydroxyapatite, in both acidic and neutral environments. By tuning the composition of PMCs, durable strength in fluids, and rapid transformation can be obtained.},

The released ICG under laser irradiation produced ROS for PDT and raised the tumor temperature for photothermal therapy (PTT). The released DOX directly caused tumor cell death for chemotherapy. Both DOX and ICG also induced immunogenic cell death (ICD) for immunotherapy. The in vivo and in vitro results presented a superior inhibition of tumor progression, metastasis and recurrence.

The purpose of this study was to ascertain the effect of the functional pressure arising from these muscles and ligaments on the hyoid body structure from its bone mineral density, bone quality, and histological observations. The area between the mesial-most part of each lesser horn and the center of the hyoid body was divided equally into four measurement regions. We conducted histological investigations at each measurement region and observed the entheses. To analyze bone mass and bone quality, we also measured bone mineral density (BMD) and analyzed biological apatite (BAp) crystallite orientation in the same regions. Histological observations identified periosteal insertions and fibrocartilaginous entheses. There was no significant difference in BMD between any of the measurement regions, but the preferential orientation of BAp crystallites was stronger in the infrahyoid muscles and ligaments, where fibrocartilaginous entheses are found, than in other places. This suggests that the functional pressure at these sites might exert a major effect not only on the morphological characteristics of the entheses but also on bone quality.},

The current study aimed to comprehensively compare the mechanical behaviors of four poly(lactic acid) (PLA) BVS designs with varying geometries via numerical methods and to clarify the optimal BVS selection. Four PLA BVS (i.e., Absorb, DESolve, Igaki-Tamai, and Fantom) were first constructed. A degradation model was refined by simply including the fatigue effect induced by pulsatile blood pressures, and an explicit solver was employed to simulate the crimping and degradation behaviors of the four PLA BVS. The degradation dynamics here were characterized by four indices. The results indicated that the stent designs affected crimping and degradation behaviors. Compared to the other three stents, the DESolve stent had the greatest radial stiffness in the crimping simulation and the best diameter maintenance ability despite its faster degradation; moreover, the stent was considered to perform better according to a pilot scoring system. The current work provides a theoretical method for studying and understanding the degradation dynamics of the PLA BVS, and it could be helpful for the design of next-generation BVS.},

Existing metabolic assays for quantifying viable bacteria in biofilms usually utilize calibration curves derived from planktonic bacteria, which can introduce large errors due to significant differences in the metabolic and/or growth rates of biofilm bacteria in the assay media compared to their planktonic counterparts. In the presented method we derive the specific growth rate of Streptococcus mutans bacteria biofilm from a series of metabolic assays using the pH indicator phenol red, and show that this information could be used to more accurately quantify the relative number of viable bacteria in a biofilm. We found that the specific growth rate of S. mutans in biofilm mode of growth was 0.70 h−1, compared to 1.09 h−1 in planktonic growth. This method should be applicable to other bacteria types, as well as other metabolic assays, and, for example, to quantify the effect of antibacterial treatments or the performance of bactericidal implant surfaces.},

Descemet stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK) allows selective replacement of the diseased corneal endothelium. However, DSAEK requires a donor cornea and the worldwide shortage of corneas limits its application. This review presents current knowledge on the tissue engineering of corneal endothelium using cultured HCECs. We also provide our recent work on tissue engineering for DSAEK grafts using cultured HCECs. We reconstructed DSAEK grafts by seeding cultured DiI-labelled HCECs on collagen sheets. Then HCEC sheets were transplanted onto the posterior stroma after descemetorhexis in the DSAEK group. Severe stromal edema was detected in the control group, but not in the DSAEK group throughout the observation period. Fluorescein microscopy one month after surgery showed numerous DiI-labelled cells on the posterior corneal surface in the DSAEK group. Frozen sections showed a monolayer of DiI-labelled cells on Descemet’s membrane. These findings indicate that cultured adult HCECs, transplanted with DSAEK surgery, maintain corneal transparency after transplantation and suggest the feasibility of performing DSAEK with HCECs to treat endothelial dysfunction.},

Limbal stem cells, which reside in the corneal periphery, contribute to the homeostasis of the corneal epithelium. Any damage or disease affecting the function of these cells may result in limbal stem cell deficiency (LSCD). The condition may result in both severe pain and blindness. Transplantation of ex vivo cultured cells onto the cornea is most often an effective therapeutic strategy for LSCD. The use of ex vivo cultured limbal epithelial cells (LEC), oral mucosal epithelial cells, and conjunctival epithelial cells to treat LSCD has been explored in humans. The present review focuses on the current state of knowledge of the many other cell-based therapies of LSCD that have so far exclusively been explored in animal models as there is currently no consensus on the best cell type for treating LSCD. Major findings of all these studies with special emphasis on substrates for culture and transplantation are systematically presented and discussed. Among the many potential cell types that still have not been used clinically, we conclude that two easily accessible autologous sources, epidermal stem cells and hair follicle-derived stem cells, are particularly strong candidates for future clinical trials.},

Conventional outflow tissues, a composite of the trabecular meshwork and the Schlemm’s canal, regulate and maintain homeostatic responses to intraocular pressure. In glaucoma, filtration of aqueous humor into the Schlemm’s canal is hindered, leading to an increase in intraocular pressure and subsequent damage to the optic nerve, with progressive vision loss.

To overcome these problems; tissue engineering and regenerative medicine strategies have been developed as a potential way to reconstruct damaged bone tissue. Different types of new biomaterials; including natural polymers; synthetic polymers and bioceramics; have emerged to treat these damaged craniofacial bone tissues in the form of injectable and non-injectable scaffolds; which are examined in this review. Injectable scaffolds can be considered a better approach to craniofacial tissue engineering as they can be inserted with minimally invasive surgery; thus protecting the aesthetic characteristics. In this review; we also focus on recent research innovations with different types of stem-cell sources harvested from oral tissue and growth factors used to develop craniofacial bone tissue-engineering strategies.},

 abstract = {Background: The restoration of non-carious cervical lesions in geriatric patients is a demanding process. Glass ionomer cements can be promising materials for the management of these lesions in older adults. The aim of this literature review is to present the benefits of glass ionomers and how they can be used for the restoration of non-carious cervical lesions of older adults depending on the geriatric patient’s profile. Data sources: All available in vitro and in vivo studies from Google Scholar, PubMed and Scopus search engines corresponding to glass ionomer cements, geriatric dentistry, elderly patients, and non-carious lesions as key words were reviewed. Data synthesis: The advantages of glass ionomer cements, such as good retention and fluoride release, make them suitable for the restoration of non-carious cervical lesions. However, several factors related to the geriatric patient’s profile determine the most suitable material type. Conclusion: In general, the resin modified glass ionomer cements (RMGICs) appear to be preferred, but under certain circumstances the use of the conventional product is more appropriate, despite its poorer mechanical features. Further studies are required for more reliable data analysis and clinical interpretation of the relevant results.},
