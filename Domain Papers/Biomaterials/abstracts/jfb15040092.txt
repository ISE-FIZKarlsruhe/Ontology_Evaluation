Nitric oxide (NO) is a unique biochemical mediator involved in the regulation of vital processes. Light-controllable NO releasers show promise in the development of smart therapies. Here, we present a novel biocompatible material based on polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) doped with BODIPY derivatives containing an N-nitroso moiety that is capable of the photoinduced generation of NO. We study the green-light-induced NO-release properties with the following three methods: electrochemical gas-phase sensor, liquid-phase sensor, and the Griess assay. Prolonged release of NO from the polymer films after short irradiation by narrow-band LED light sources and a laser beam is demonstrated. Importantly, this was accompanied by no or little release of the parent compound (BODIPY-based photodonor). Silicone films with the capability of controllable and clean NO release can potentially be used as a highly portable NO delivery system for different therapeutic applications.
