Hydroxyapatites modified with metal ions are the main inorganic components of bone tissue and are approved for use as components for biocomposites and coatings for surgical implants. This study examined prototypes of functional materials for bone implants based on hydroxyapatite modified with zinc ions. Zinc-modified hydroxyapatite was composed and synthesized. Using the XRD method, the phase composition was established. Using SEM, EPMA, and low-temperature nitrogen adsorption (BET) methods, surface properties were investigated. Antibacterial activity and biocompatibility have been established. The studied materials have antimicrobial activity; the samples did not cause significant changes in either the internal organs or the general condition of laboratory animals during the entire experiment.
