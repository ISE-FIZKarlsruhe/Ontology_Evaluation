ABSTRACT = {Phosphorylated chitooligosaccharides (P-COS) were prepared using a H3PO4, P2O5, Et3PO4 and hexanol solvent system. The P-COS were characterized by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR), Thermo gravimetric-Differential Thermal Analyzer (TG-DTA), 13C NMR, 31P NMR, X-ray diffraction analysis, solubility studies, biocompatibility and Alkaline Phosphatase Activity (ALP). The results reveal that phosphorylation occurred at the C3 and C6 position of OH groups and the C2 position of NH2 group. FT-IR confirmed no decomposition in pyranose ring in P-COS even with heating and treatment in acidic conditions. The amorphous nature of P-COS was confirmed by X-ray diffraction analysis. Further, the biocompatibility and alkaline phosphatase activity of P-COS were checked against the osteosarcoma MG63 cell line at different concentrations and no cytotoxicity was observed. After 12 h and 24 h of incubation, the ALP activity of P-COS was higher compared with the control group. These results suggest that P-COS is a biocompatible material and in future P-COS could open up a number of promising pharmaceutical and clinical applications to mankind.},

ABSTRACT = {In the late 1960s, much interest was raised in regard to biomedical applications of various ceramic materials. A little bit later, such materials were named bioceramics. This review is limited to bioceramics prepared from calcium orthophosphates only, which belong to the categories of bioactive and bioresorbable compounds. There have been a number of important advances in this field during the past 30–40 years. Namely, by structural and compositional control, it became possible to choose whether calcium orthophosphate bioceramics were biologically stable once incorporated within the skeletal structure or whether they were resorbed over time. At the turn of the millennium, a new concept of calcium orthophosphate bioceramics—which is able to promote regeneration of bones—was developed. Presently, calcium orthophosphate bioceramics are available in the form of particulates, blocks, cements, coatings, customized designs for specific applications and as injectable composites in a polymer carrier. Current biomedical applications include artificial replacements for hips, knees, teeth, tendons and ligaments, as well as repair for periodontal disease, maxillofacial reconstruction, augmentation and stabilization of the jawbone, spinal fusion and bone fillers after tumor surgery. Exploratory studies demonstrate potential applications of calcium orthophosphate bioceramics as scaffolds, drug delivery systems, as well as carriers of growth factors, bioactive peptides and/or various types of cells for tissue engineering purposes.},

ABSTRACT = {Chronic dermal lesions, such as pressure ulcers, are difficult to heal. Degradable tissue scaffold systems can be employed to serve as a provisional matrix for cellular ingrowth and facilitate regenerative healing during degradation. Degradable regenerative tissue scaffold matrices can be created by crosslinking albumin with functionalized poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) polymers. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the stability of PEG-albumin scaffold systems formed using PEG polymers with three different functionalized end chemistries by quantifying in vitro system swellability to determine the most promising PEG crosslinking polymer for wound healing applications. Of the three polymers evaluated, PEG-succinimidyl glutarate (SG) exhibited consistent gelation and handling characteristics when used as the crosslinking agent with albumin. PEG-SG polymers were identified as an appropriate synthetic crosslinking moiety in a PEG-albumin scaffold system, and further in vitro and in vivo evaluation of this scaffold system is merited.},

ABSTRACT = {Physics-based biomedical approaches have proved their importance for the advancement of medical sciences and especially in medical diagnostics and treatments. Thus, the expectations regarding development of novel promising physics-based technologies and tools are very high. This review describes the latest research advances in biomedical applications of external physical cues. We overview three distinct topics: using high-gradient magnetic fields in nanoparticle-mediated cell responses; non-thermal plasma as a novel bactericidal agent; highlights in understanding of cellular mechanisms of laser irradiation. Furthermore, we summarize the progress, challenges and opportunities in those directions. We also discuss some of the fundamental physical principles involved in the application of each cue. Considerable technological success has been achieved in those fields. However, for the successful clinical translation we have to understand the limitations of technologies. Importantly, we identify the misconceptions pervasive in the discussed fields.},

ABSTRACT = {Periodontal diseases involve injuries to the supporting structures of the tooth and, if left untreated, can lead to the loss of the tooth. Regenerative periodontal therapies aim, ideally, at healing all the damaged periodontal tissues and represent a significant clinical and societal challenge for the current ageing population. This review provides a picture of the currently-used biomaterials for periodontal regeneration, including natural and synthetic polymers, bioceramics (e.g., calcium phosphates and bioactive glasses), and composites. Bioactive materials aim at promoting the regeneration of new healthy tissue. Polymers are often used as barrier materials in guided tissue regeneration strategies and are suitable both to exclude epithelial down-growth and to allow periodontal ligament and alveolar bone cells to repopulate the defect. The problems related to the barrier postoperative collapse can be solved by using a combination of polymeric membranes and grafting materials. Advantages and drawbacks associated with the incorporation of growth factors and nanomaterials in periodontal scaffolds are also discussed, along with the development of multifunctional and multilayer implants. Tissue-engineering strategies based on functionally-graded scaffolds are expected to play an ever-increasing role in the management of periodontal defects.},

ABSTRACT = {Polymer nanoparticles (NPs) represent one of the most innovative non-invasive approaches for drug delivery applications. NPs main objective is to convey the therapeutic molecule be they drugs, proteins, or nucleic acids directly into the target organ or tissue. Many polymers are used for the synthesis of NPs and among the currently most employed materials several biocompatible synthetic polymers, namely polylactic acid (PLA), poly lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA), and polyethylene glycol (PEG), can be cited. These molecules are made of simple monomers which are naturally present in the body and therefore easily excreted without being toxic. The present review addresses the different approaches that are most commonly adopted to synthetize biocompatible NPs to date, as well as the experimental strategies designed to load them with therapeutic agents. In fact, drugs may be internalized in the NPs or physically dispersed therein. In this paper the various types of biodegradable polymer NPs will be discussed with emphasis on their applications in drug delivery. Close attention will be devoted to the treatment of cancer, where both active and passive targeting is used to enhance efficacy and reduce systemic toxicity, and to diseases affecting the central nervous system, inasmuch as NPs can be modified to target specific cells or cross membrane barriers.},

ABSTRACT = {Prescription of implant treatments is very widespread at present, mainly due to the low rate of annual loss and, to date, few studies have assessed their survival in the routine clinical practice of dentistry. The purpose of this observational study was to evaluate the effectiveness of dental implants with a calcium-phosphate surface in the daily practice of dental clinics. A multicenter, prospective, non-interventional, observational study was performed, in which three experienced practitioners (one maxillofacial and two oral surgeons) inserted implants using standard external and internal hexagon connections in adult patients requiring ≥1 osseointegrated implants to replace missing teeth. Follow-up was performed for 24 months after implant loading. Two hundred and twelve subjects were included (51.5% men), with a mean age of 51.2 ± 11.90 years, in whom 544 implants were inserted. 87.2% of the patients received 1–4 implants. The preferred connection system was internal hexagon (73.5%). There were nine failures, with an interval survival rate (ISR) at 24 months of 100% and a cumulative survival rate (CSR) of 98.3%. In conclusion, implants with a modified calcium-phosphate surface are associated with a high rate of survival and may be considered a method of choice in clinical practice.},

ABSTRACT = {(1) Background: Evaluate the osteoconduction capability of a biphasic calcium phosphate (BCP) ceramic composed of hydroxyapatite and β-tricalcium phosphate 60%/40% in a rat model. (2) Methods: In the calvarial bone of 54 adult male rats, 7-mm diameter critical size defects were performed. The animals were randomly allocated to three experimental groups according to the type of material: blood clot (BCG), blood clot covered with a bovine-derived collagen membrane (MBCG), and BCP ceramic covered with a bovine-derived collagen membrane (BCPG). In each group, 6 animals were euthanatized at post-operative days 7, 30, and 60 for histological and histometric analysis. (3) Results: The qualitative analysis revealed the persistence of the collagen membrane at seven days, with no relevant newly bone formation in all groups. At 30 days, centripetal bone formation was observed residual particles of the biomaterial surrounded by fibroblasts noted in the BCPG. At 60 days, while BCG and MBCG showed a partial maturation with the central part of the defect populated by a fibrous connective tissue, in the BCPG the critical area was entirely occupied by newly formed bone. In the intra groups analysis was noted a significant increase in new bone formation during the experimental period (p < 0.05). At 60 days, BCPG showed a higher percentage area of new bone formation (p < 0.05). (4) Conclusion: BCP promoted a new bone formation by osteoconduction and might be considered a valid alternative in bone regeneration procedures.},

ABSTRACT = {3D printing of polymers can now be considered as a common processing technology for the development of biomaterials. These can be constituted out of polymeric abiotic material alone or can be co-printed with living cells. However, the adaptive and shape-morphing characteristics cannot be developed with the rigid, pre-determined structures obtained by 3D printing. In order to produce functional engineered biomaterials, the dynamic properties/characteristics of the living cells must be attained. 4D printing can be envisaged as a route to achieve these goals. This paper intends to give a brief review of the pioneer 4D printing research that has been developed and to present an insight into future research in this field.},

ABSTRACT = {Biomaterial enhanced regeneration (BER) falls mostly under the broad heading of Tissue Engineering: the use of materials (synthetic and natural) usually in conjunction with cells (both native and genetically modified as well as stem cells) and/or biological response modifiers (growth factors and cytokines as well as other stimuli, which alter cellular activity). Although the emphasis is on the biomaterial as a scaffold it is also the use of additive bioactivity to enhance the healing and regenerative properties of the scaffold. Enhancing regeneration is both moving more toward regeneration but also speeding up the process. The review covers principles of design for BER as well as strategies to select the best designs. This is first general design principles, followed by types of design options, and then specific strategies for applications in skin and load bearing applications. The last section, surveys current clinical practice (for skin and load bearing applications) including limitations of these approaches. This is followed by future directions with an attempt to prioritize strategies. Although the review is geared toward design optimization, prioritization also includes the commercializability of the devices. This means a device must meet both the clinical performance design constraints as well as the commercializability design constraints.},

ABSTRACT = {Dicalcium phosphate dihydrate (DCPD) is one of the mineral phases indicated as possible precursors of biological apatites and it is widely employed in the preparation of calcium phosphate bone cements. Herein, we investigated the possibility to functionalize DCPD with aspartic acid (ASP) and poly-aspartic acid (PASP), as models of the acidic macromolecules of biomineralized tissues, and studied their influence on DCPD hydrolysis. To this aim, the synthesis of DCPD was performed in aqueous solution in the presence of increasing concentrations of PASP and ASP, whereas the hydrolysis reaction was carried out in physiological solution up to three days. The results indicate that it is possible to prepare DCPD functionalized with PASP up to a polyelectrolyte content of about 2.3 wt%. The increase of PASP content induces crystal aggregation, reduction of the yield of the reaction and of the thermal stability of the synthesized DCPD. Moreover, DCPD samples functionalized with PASP display a slower hydrolysis than pure DCPD. On the other hand, in the explored range of concentrations (up to 10 mM) ASP is not incorporated into DCPD and does not influence its crystallization nor its hydrolysis. At variance, when present in the hydrolysis solution, ASP, and even more PASP, delays the conversion into the more stable phases, octacalcium phosphate and/or hydroxyapatite. The greater influence of PASP on the synthesis and hydrolysis of DCPD can be ascribed to the cooperative action of the carboxylate groups and to its good fit with DCPD structure.},

ABSTRACT = {A synthetic technique inspired by the biomineralisation process in nacre has been previously reported to be effective in replicating the nanostructural elements of nacre in 2D chitosan hydrogel films. Here we evaluate the applicability of this synthetic biomineralisation technique, herein called the McGrath method, in replicating the flat tabular morphology of calcium carbonate and other nanostructural elements obtained when 2D chitosan hydrogel films were used, on a 3D porous chitosan hydrogel-based scaffold, hence developing 3D chitosan-calcium carbonate composites. Nozzle extrusion-based 3D printing technology was used to develop 3D porous scaffolds using chitosan hydrogel as the printing ink in a custom-designed 3D printer. The rheology of the printing ink and print parameters were optimised in order to fabricate 3D cylindrical structures with a cubic lattice-based internal structure. The effects of various dehydration techniques, including air-drying, critical point-drying and freeze-drying, on the structural integrity of the as-printed scaffolds from the nano to macroscale, were evaluated. The final 3D composite materials were characterised using scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The study has shown that McGrath method can be used to develop chitosan-calcium carbonate composites wherein the mineral and matrix are in intimate association with each other at the nanoscale. This process can be successfully integrated with 3D printing technology to develop 3D compartmentalised polymer-mineral composites.},

ABSTRACT = {This study investigated the impact of different calcium reagents on the morphology, composition, bioactivity and biocompatibility of two-component (CaO-SiO2) glasses produced by the Stöber process with respect to their potential application in guided tissue regeneration (GTR) membranes for periodontal repair. The properties of the binary glasses were compared with those of pure silica Stöber particles. The direct addition of calcium chloride (CC), calcium nitrate (CN), calcium methoxide (CM) or calcium ethoxide (CE) at 5 mol % with respect to tetraethyl orthosilicate in the reagent mixture gave rise to textured, micron-sized aggregates rather than monodispersed ~500 nm spheres obtained from the pure silica Stöber synthesis. The broadening of the Si-O-Si band at ~1100 cm−1 in the infrared spectra of the calcium-doped glasses indicated that the silicate network was depolymerised by the incorporation of Ca2+ ions and energy dispersive X-ray analysis revealed that, in all cases, the Ca:Si ratios were significantly lower than the nominal value of 0.05. The distribution of Ca2+ ions was also found to be highly inhomogeneous in the methoxide-derived glass. All samples released soluble silica species on exposure to simulated body fluid, although only calcium-doped glasses exhibited in vitro bioactivity via the formation of hydroxyapatite. The biocompatibilities of model chitosan-glass GTR membranes were assessed using human MG63 osteosarcoma cells and were found to be of the order: CN < pure silica ≈ CC << CM ≈ CE. Calcium nitrate is the most commonly reported precursor for the sol-gel synthesis of bioactive glasses; however, the incomplete removal of nitrate ions during washing compromised the cytocompatibility of the resulting glass. The superior bioactivity and biocompatibility of the alkoxide-derived glasses is attributed to their ease of dissolution and lack of residual toxic anions. Overall, calcium ethoxide was found to be the preferred precursor with respect to extent of calcium-incorporation, homogeneity, bioactivity and biocompatibility.},

ABSTRACT = {Aim: The purpose of the present study is to assess the color stability of two calcium silicate-based cements (CSCs) used in regenerative endodontic procedures (REPs). Methods: A total of 40 acrylic single-rooted transparent teeth, with immature apex, were used. Root canals were filled up to 3 mm below the level of the cementoenamel junction, with either saline solution (Mineral Trioxide Aggregate (MTA)/saline and Biodentine/saline) or blood (MTA/blood and Biodentine/blood). Subsequently, ProRoot MTA® or BiodentineTM was placed in the root canal to create a cervical barrier. Color measurement was carried out at four different evaluation periods (3 h, 72 h, 7 days, and 6 months). Shade analysis within the L* a* b* color space was performed and color variation (∆E) calculated. The significance level for statistical analysis was set at p < 0.05. Results: The four groups showed a significant decrease in L* values over time. The ΔE value increased over time for all groups but was not statistically significant for the Biodentine/blood group. Two-way ANOVA showed no interaction between the CSC and treatment (contact with saline solution or blood). CSC used was the factor responsible for ΔE over time, inducing statistically significant color variations from T3H to T7D (p = 0.04) and T3H to T6M (p < 0.01). After 6 months, MTA/saline had 5.08 (p = 0.001) higher ΔE than Biodentine/Saline and the MTA/blood had 3.65 (p = 0.009) higher than Biodentine/blood. Conclusions: After 6 months, regardless of blood exposure, Biodentine exhibits superior color stability compared to MTA. Biodentine might be a suitable alternative to MTA as a cervical barrier material in REPs.},

The scaffold was characterized using compression testing, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray microtomography (XMT) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The bioactivity of the scaffold was evaluated by its ability to form apatite on its surface in simulated body fluid (SBF). The data collected showed evidence that the novel material produced had an appropriate pore size for osteoconduction, with an average pore size of 110 µm and maximum pore size of 309 µm. Statistical analysis confirmed that the glass filler significantly (P < 0.05) increased the collapse yield of the scaffolds compared with pure alginate scaffolds. The ICIE16M glass had an amorphous structure, favorable for bioactivity.},

ABSTRACT = {Additive manufacturing has great potential for personalized medicine in osseous fixation surgery, including maxillofacial and orthopedic applications. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate 3D printing methods for the fabrication of patient-specific fixation implants that allow for localized drug delivery. 3D printing was used to fabricate gentamicin (GS) and methotrexate (MTX)-loaded fixation devices, including screws, pins, and bone plates. Scaffolds with different infill ratios of polylactic acid (PLA), both without drugs and impregnated with GS and MTX, were printed into cylindrical and rectangular-shaped constructs for compressive and flexural strength mechanical testing, respectively. Bland PLA constructs showed significantly higher flexural strength when printed in a Y axis at 100% infill compared to other axes and infill ratios; however, there was no significant difference in flexural strength between other axes and infill ratios. GS and MTX-impregnated constructs had significantly lower flexural and compressive strength as compared to the bland PLA constructs. GS-impregnated implants demonstrated bacterial inhibition in plate cultures. Similarly, MTX-impregnated implants demonstrated a cytotoxic effect in osteosarcoma assays. This proof of concept work shows the potential of developing 3D printed screws and plating materials with the requisite mechanical properties and orientations. Drug-impregnated implants were technically successful and had an anti-bacterial and chemotherapeutic effect, but drug addition significantly decreased the flexural and compressive strengths of the custom implants.},

ABSTRACT = {The biological effects and cellular activations triggered by monosodium urate (MSU) and calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (monoclinic: m-CPPD) crystals might be modulated by protein coating on the crystal surface. This study is aimed at: (i) Identifying proteins adsorbed on m-CPPD crystals, and the underlying mechanisms of protein adsorption, and (ii) to understand how protein coating did modulate the inflammatory properties of m-CPPD crystals. The effects of protein coating were assessed in vitro using primary macrophages and THP1 monocytes. Physico-chemical studies on the adsorption of bovine serum albumin (BSA) upon m-CPPD crystals were performed. Adsorption of serum proteins, and BSA on MSU, as well as upon m-CPPD crystals, inhibited their capacity to induce interleukin-1-β secretions, along with a decreased ATP secretion, and a disturbance of mitochondrial membrane depolarization, suggesting an alteration of NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Proteomic analysis identified numerous m-CPPD-associated proteins including hemoglobin, complement, albumin, apolipoproteins and coagulation factors. BSA adsorption on m-CPPD crystals followed a Langmuir-Freundlich isotherm, suggesting that it could modulate m-CPPD crystal-induced cell responses through crystal/cell-membrane interaction. BSA is adsorbed on m-CPPD crystals with weak interactions, confirmed by the preliminary AFM study, but strong interactions of BSA molecules with each other occurred favoring crystal agglomeration, which might contribute to a decrease in the inflammatory properties of m-CPPD crystals. These findings give new insights into the pathogenesis of crystal-related rheumatic diseases and subsequently may open the way for new therapeutic approaches.},

ABSTRACT = {Accurate determination of the amount of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in a complex mixture of extracellular matrix (ECM) is important for tissue morphogenesis and homeostasis. The aim of the present study was to investigate an accurate, simple and sensitive alcian blue (AB) method for quantifying heparin in biological samples. A method for analyzing heparin was developed and parameters such as volume, precipitation time, solvent component, and solubility time were evaluated. The AB dye and heparin samples were allowed to react at 4 ℃ for 24 h. The heparin-AB complex was dissolved in 25 N NaOH and 2-Aminoethanol (1:24 v/v). The optical density of the solution was analyzed by UV-Vis spectrometry at 620 nm. The modified AB method was validated in accordance with U.S. Food and Drug Administration guidelines. The limit of detection was found to be 2.95 µg/mL. Intraday and interday precision ranged between 2.14–4.83% and 3.16–7.02% (n = 9), respectively. Overall recovery for three concentration levels varied between 97 ± 3.5%, confirming good accuracy. In addition, this study has discovered the interdisciplinary nature of protein detection using the AB method. The basis for this investigation was that the fibrous protein inhibits heparin-AB complex whereas globular protein does not. Further, we measured the content of sulfated GAGs (sGAGs; expressed as heparin equivalent) in the ECM of decellularized porcine liver. In conclusion, the AB method may be used for the quantitative analysis of heparin in ECM scaffolds for tissue engineering applications.},

ABSTRACT = {β-tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP) is one of the most common bioceramics, widely applied in bone cements and implants. Herein we synthesized β-TCP by solid state reaction in the presence of increasing amounts of two biologically active ions, namely strontium and zinc, in order to clarify the structural modifications induced by ionic substitution. The results of X-ray diffraction analysis indicate that zinc can substitute for calcium into a β-TCP structure up to about 10 at% inducing a reduction of the cell parameters, whereas the substitution occurs up to about 80 at% in the case of strontium, which provokes a linear increase of the lattice constants, and a slight modification into a more symmetric structure. Rietveld refinements and solid-state 31P NMR spectra demonstrate that the octahedral Ca(5) is the site of β-TCP preferred by the small zinc ion. ATR-FTIR results indicate that zinc substitution provokes a disorder of β-TCP structure. At variance with the behavior of zinc, strontium completely avoids Ca(5) site even at high concentration, whereas it exhibits a clear preference for Ca(4) site. The infrared absorption bands of β-TCP show a general shift towards lower wavenumbers on increasing strontium content. Particularly significant is the shift of the infrared symmetric stretching band at 943 cm−1 due to P(1), that is the phosphate more involved in Ca(4) coordination, which further supports the occupancy preference of strontium.},

ABSTRACT = {(1) Background: The tissue engineering field has been working to find biomaterials that mimic the biological properties of autogenous bone grafts. (2) Aim: To evaluate the osteoconduction potential of injectable calcium phosphate cement implanted in critical defects in rat calvaria. (3) Methods: In the calvarial bone of 36 rats, 7-mm diameter critical size defects were performed. Afterwards, the animals were randomly divided into three groups according to filler material: a blood clot group (BC), blood clot membrane group (BCM), and an injectable β-tricalcium phosphate group (HBS) cement group. After periods of 30 and 60 days, the animals were euthanized, the calvaria was isolated, and submitted to a decalcification process for later blades confection. Qualitative and quantitative analysis of the neoformed bone tissue were conducted, and histometric data were statistically analyzed. (4) Results: Sixty days post-surgery, the percentages of neoformed bone were 10.67 ± 5.57 in group BC, 16.71 ± 5.0 in group BCM, and 55.11 ± 13.20 in group HBS. The bone formation values in group HBS were significantly higher (p < 0.05) than in groups BC and BCM. (5) Conclusions: Based on these results, it can be concluded that injectable calcium phosphate cement is an osteoconductive material that can be used to fill bone cavities.},

ABSTRACT = {Blood-derived growth factor preparations have long been employed to improve perfusion and aid tissue repair. Among these, platelet-rich plasma (PRP)-based therapies have seen the widest application, albeit with mixed clinical results to date. Hypoxia-preconditioned blood products present an alternative to PRP, by comprising the complete wound healing factor-cascade, i.e., hypoxia-induced peripheral blood cell signaling, in addition to platelet-derived factors. This study set out to characterize the preparation of hypoxia preconditioned serum (HPS), and assess the utility of HPS–fibrin hydrogels as vehicles for controlled factor delivery. Our findings demonstrate the positive influence of hypoxic incubation on HPS angiogenic potential, and the individual variability of HPS angiogenic factor concentration. HPS–fibrin hydrogels can rapidly retain HPS factor proteins and gradually release them over time, while both functions appear to depend on the fibrin matrix mass. This offers a means of controlling factor retention/release, through adjustment of HPS fibrinogen concentration, thus allowing modulation of cellular angiogenic responses in a growth factor dose-dependent manner. This study provides the first evidence that HPS–fibrin hydrogels could constitute a new generation of autologous/bioactive injectable compositions that provide biochemical and biomaterial signals analogous to those mediating physiological wound healing. This therefore establishes a rational foundation for their application towards biomimetic tissue regeneration.},

ABSTRACT = {Nanofibrous-based pH sensors have shown promise in a wide range of industrial and medical applications due to their fast response time and good mechanical properties. In the present study, we fabricated pH-sensitive sensors of nanofibrous membranes by electrospinning polyurethane (PU)/poly 2-acrylamido-2-methylpropanesulfonic acid (PAMPS)/graphene oxide (GO) with indicator dyes. The morphology of the electrospun nanofibers was examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The effect of hydrophilic polymer ratio and concentration of GO on the sensing response time was investigated. The sensitivity of the membranes was studied over a wide pH range (1–8) in solution tests, with color change measured by calculating total color difference using UV-vis spectroscopy. The membranes were also subjected to vapor tests at three different pH values (1, 4, 8). SEM results show the successful fabrication of bimodal fiber diameter distributions of PU (mean fiber diameter 519 nm) and PAMPS (mean fiber diameter 78 nm). Sensing response time decreased dramatically with increasing concentrations of PAMPS and GO. The hybrid hydrophobic/hydrophilic/GO nanofibrous membranes are capable of instantly responding to changes in solution pH as well as detecting pH changes in chemical vapor solution in as little as 7 s.},

ABSTRACT = {Nerve injuries requiring surgery are a significant problem without good clinical alternatives to the autograft. Tissue engineering strategies are critically needed to provide an alternative. In this study, we utilized aligned nanofibers that were click-modified with the bioactive peptide RGD for rat sciatic nerve repair. Empty conduits or conduits filled with either non-functionalized aligned nanofibers or RGD-functionalized aligned nanofibers were used to repair a 13 mm gap in the rat sciatic nerve of animals for six weeks. The aligned nanofibers encouraged cell infiltration and nerve repair as shown by histological analysis. RGD-functionalized nanofibers reduced muscle atrophy. During the six weeks of recovery, the animals were subjected to motor and sensory tests. Sensory recovery was improved in the RGD-functionalized nanofiber group by week 4, while other groups needed six weeks to show improvement after injury. Thus, the use of functionalized nanofibers provides cues that aid in in vivo nerve repair and should be considered as a future repair strategy.},

ABSTRACT = {Biodentine is one of the most successful and widely studied among the second generation of calcium silicate-based endodontic cements. Despite its popularity, the setting reactions of this cement system are not currently well understood. In particular, very little is known about the formation and structure of the major calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H) gel phase, as it is difficult to obtain information on this poorly crystalline material by the traditional techniques of powder X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). In this study, the hydration reactions of Biodentine are monitored by XRD, FTIR, isothermal conduction calorimetry and, for the first time, 29Si magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (29Si MAS NMR) is used to investigate the structures of the anhydrous calcium silicate phases and the early C-S-H gel product. XRD analysis indicated that the anhydrous powder comprises 73.8 wt% triclinic tricalcium silicate, 4.45 wt% monoclinic β-dicalcium silicate, 16.6 wt% calcite and 5.15 wt% zirconium oxide. Calorimetry confirmed that the induction period for hydration is short, and that the setting reactions are rapid with a maximum heat evolution of 28.4 mW g−1 at 42 min. A progressive shift in the FTIR peak maximum from 905 to 995 cm−1 for the O-Si-O stretching vibrations accompanies the formation of the C-S-H gel during 1 week. The extent of hydration was determined by 29Si MAS NMR to be 87.0%, 88.8% and 93.7% at 6 h, 1 day and 1 week, respectively, which is significantly higher than that of MTA. The mean silicate chain length (MCL) of the C-S-H gel was also estimated by this technique to be 3.7 at 6 h and 1 day, and to have increased to 4.1 after 1 week. The rapid hydration kinetics of Biodentine, arising from the predominance of the tricalcium silicate phase, small particle size, and ‘filler effect’ of calcite and zirconium oxide, is a favorable characteristic of an endodontic cement, and the high values of MCL are thought to promote the durability of the cement matrix.},

ABSTRACT = {Repairs of orbital post-traumatic and extensive malignant defects remain a major surgical challenge, in view of follow-up outcomes. Incorrect surgical management of injured facial structures results in cosmetic, ophthalmic, and social aftereffects. A custom-made knitted TiNi-based mesh (KTNM) endograft was employed to overcome post-surgical complications and post-resected lesions of the orbital area. Preoperative high-resolution computed tomography (CT) imaging and CAD modelling were used to design the customized KTNM in each case. Twenty-five patients underwent surgery utilizing the suggested technique, from 2014 to 2019. In all documented cases, resolution of the ophthalmic malfunction was noted in the early period. Follow-up observation evidenced no relapsed enophthalmos, hypoglobus, or diplopia as late complications. The findings emanating from our clinical observations allow us to claim that the KTNM indicated a high level of biocompatibility. It is simply modified intraoperatively to attach any desired shape/size for implantation and can also be screw-fixed, providing a good supporting ability. The KTNM precisely renders orbitozygomatic outlines and orbital floor, thus recovering the anatomical structure, and is regarded as an attractive alternative to Ti-based meshes and plates. Additionally, we report one of the studied cases, where good functional and cosmetic outcomes have been achieved.},

ABSTRACT = {Cell scaffolds are often used in cell transplantation as they provide a solid structural support to implanted cells and can be bioengineered to mimic the native extracellular matrix. Gadolinium fluoride nanoparticles (Gd-NPs) as a contrast agent for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) were incorporated into poly(lactide-co-glycolide)/chitosan scaffolds to obtain Imaging Labelled Cell Scaffolds (ILCSs), having the shape of hollow spherical/ellipsoidal particles (200–600 μm diameter and 50–80 μm shell thickness). While Gd-NPs incorporated into microparticles do not provide any contrast enhancement in T1-weighted (T1w) MR images, ILCSs can release Gd-NPs in a controlled manner, thus activating MRI contrast. ILCSs seeded with human mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSCs) were xenografted subcutaneously into either immunocompromised and immunocompetent mice without any immunosuppressant treatments, and the transplants were followed-up in vivo by MRI for 18 days. Immunocompromised mice showed a progressive activation of MRI contrast within the implants due to the release of Gd-NPs in the extracellular matrix. Instead, immunocompetent mice showed poor activation of MRI contrast due to the encapsulation of ILCSs within fibrotic capsules and to the scavenging of released Gd-NPs by phagocytic cells. In conclusion, the MRI follow-up of cell xenografts can report the host cell response to the xenograft. However, it does not strictly report on the viability of transplanted hMSCs.},

ABSTRACT = {Carbon fibre reinforced polyether ether ketone (CFR-PEEK) is a suitable material to replace metal implants in orthopaedic surgery. The radiolucency of CFR-PEEK allows an optimal visualisation of the bone and soft tissue structures. We aimed to assess the performance and radiological and clinical outcomes of anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) with CFR-PEEK anterior cervical plating (ACP) under first use clinical conditions. We retrospectively studied the prospectively-collected data of 42 patients who underwent ACDF with CFR-PEEK ACP between 2011 and 2016. We assessed clinical outcome (Odom’s criteria, complications) and radiological parameters (global and segmental cervical lordosis, Bridwell score for fusion, adjacent segment degeneration) preoperatively, immediately post-operatively, and after a 12-month follow-up period. Patients’ satisfaction was excellent, good, fair, and poor in 12, 19, 3, and 1 patients, respectively. Two patients developed dysphagia. No hardware failure occurred. Compared with preoperative radiographs, we observed a gain of global cervical lordosis and segmental lordosis (7.4 ± 10.1 and 5.6 ± 7.1 degrees, respectively) at the 12-month follow-up. Bridwell IF grades I, II, and III were observed in 22, 6, and 7 patients, respectively. The 12-month adjacent segment degeneration-free and adjacent segment disease-free survival rates were 93.1% and 96.3%, respectively. We observed a dysphagia rate of 5.7% and a reoperation rate of 4.8%. In conclusion, CFR-PEEK ACP shows positive outcomes in terms of implant safety, restoration of cervical lordosis, and functional recovery, and is suitable for ACDF.},

ABSTRACT = {Tissue engineering aims to develop artificial human tissues by culturing cells on a scaffold in the presence of biochemical cues. Properties of scaffold such as architecture and composition highly influence the overall cell response. Electrospinning has emerged as one of the most affordable, versatile, and successful approaches to develop nonwoven nano/microscale fibrous scaffolds whose structural features resemble that of the native extracellular matrix. However, dense packing of the fibers leads to small-sized pores which obstruct cell infiltration and therefore is a major limitation for their use in tissue engineering applications. To this end, a variety of approaches have been investigated to enhance the pore properties of the electrospun scaffolds. In this review, we collect state-of-the-art modification methods and summarize them into six classes as follows: approaches focused on optimization of packing density by (a) conventional setup, (b) sequential or co-electrospinning setups, (c) involving sacrificial elements, (d) using special collectors, (e) post-production processing, and (f) other specialized methods. Overall, this review covers historical as well as latest methodologies in the field and therefore acts as a quick reference for those interested in electrospinning matrices for tissue engineering and beyond.},

ABSTRACT = {Grafts are required to restore tissue integrity and function. However, current gold standard autografting techniques yield limited harvest, with high rates of complication. In the search for viable substitutes, the number of biomaterials being developed and studied has increased rapidly. To date, low clinical uptake has accompanied inherently high failure rates, with immune rejection a specific and common end result. The objective of this review article was to evaluate published immune assays evaluating biomaterials, and to stress the value that incorporating immune assessment into evaluations carries. Immunogenicity assays have had three areas of focus: cell viability, maturation and activation, with the latter being the focus in the majority of the literature due to its relevance to functional outcomes. With recent studies suggesting poor correlation between current in vitro and in vivo testing of biomaterials, in vitro immune response assays may be more relevant and enhance ability in predicting acceptance prior to in vivo application. Uptake of in vitro immune response assessment will allow for substantial reductions in experimental time and resources, including unnecessary and unethical animal use, with a simultaneous decrease in inappropriate biomaterials reaching clinic. This improvement in bench to bedside safety is paramount to reduce patient harm.},

ABSTRACT = {Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease associated with loss or dysfunction of dopaminergic neurons located in the substantia nigra (SN), and there is no cure available. An emerging new approach for treatment is to transplant human induced dopaminergic neurons directly into the denervated striatal brain target region. Unfortunately, neurons grafted into the substantia nigra are unable to grow axons into the striatum and thus do not allow recovery of the original connectivity. Towards overcoming this general limitation in guided neuronal regeneration, we develop here magnetic nanoparticles functionalized with proteins involved in the regulation of axonal growth. We show covalent binding of constitutive active human rat sarcoma (RAS) proteins or RAS guanine nucleotide exchange factor catalytic domain of son of sevenless (SOS) by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy and multiangle light scattering as well as the characterization of exchange factor activity. Human dopaminergic neurons were differentiated from neural precursor cells and characterized by electrophysiological and immune histochemical methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate magnetic translocation of cytoplasmic γ-Fe2O3@SiO2 core-shell nanoparticles into the neurite extensions of induced human neurons. Altogether, we developed tools towards remote control of directed neurite growth in human dopaminergic neurons. These results may have relevance for future therapeutic approaches of cell replacement therapy in Parkinson’s disease.},

ABSTRACT = {Poly(d,l–lactide–co–glycolide) (PLGA) has been extensively explored for bone regeneration applications; however, its clinical use is limited by low osteointegration. Therefore, approaches that incorporate osteoconductive molecules are of great interest. Graphene oxide (GO) is gaining popularity for biomedical applications due to its ability to bind biological molecules and present them for enhanced bioactivity. This study reports the preparation of PLGA microparticles via Pickering emulsification using GO as the sole surfactant, which resulted in hybrid microparticles in the size range of 1.1 to 2.4 µm based on the ratio of GO to PLGA in the reaction. Furthermore, this study demonstrated that the hybrid GO-PLGA microparticles were not cytotoxic to either primary human fetal cartilage rudiment cells or the human osteoblast-like cell line, Saos-2. Additionally, the GO-PLGA microparticles promoted the osteogenic differentiation of the human fetal cartilage rudiment cells in the absence of exogenous growth factors to a greater extent than PLGA alone. These findings demonstrate that GO-PLGA microparticles are cytocompatible, osteoinductive and have potential as substrates for bone tissue engineering.},

ABSTRACT = {Over the past 10 years, stimuli-responsive polymeric biomaterials have emerged as effective systems for the delivery of therapeutics. Persistent with ongoing efforts to minimize adverse effects, stimuli-responsive biomaterials are designed to release in response to either chemical, physical, or biological triggers. The stimuli-responsiveness of smart biomaterials may improve spatiotemporal specificity of release. The material design may be used to tailor smart polymers to release a drug when particular stimuli are present. Smart biomaterials may use internal or external stimuli as triggering mechanisms. Internal stimuli-responsive smart biomaterials include those that respond to specific enzymes or changes in microenvironment pH; external stimuli can consist of electromagnetic, light, or acoustic energy; with some smart biomaterials responding to multiple stimuli. This review looks at current and evolving stimuli-responsive polymeric biomaterials in their proposed applications.},

ABSTRACT = {Transparent composite hydrogel in the form of a contact lens made from poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) and cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) was subjected to in vitro biocompatibility evaluation with human corneal epithelial cells (HCE-2 cells). The cell response to direct contact with the hydrogels was investigated by placing the samples on top of confluent cell layers and evaluating cell viability, morphology, and cell layer integrity subsequent to 24 h culture and removal of the hydrogels. To further characterize the lens–cell interactions, HCE-2 cells were seeded on the hydrogels, with and without simulated tear fluid (STF) pre-conditioning, and cell viability and morphology were evaluated. Furthermore, protein adsorption on the hydrogel surface was investigated by incubating the materials with STF, followed by protein elution and quantification. The hydrogel material was found to have affinity towards protein adsorption, most probably due to the interactions between the positively charged lysozyme and the negatively charged CNCs embedded in the PVA matrix. The direct contact experiment demonstrated that the physical presence of the lenses did not affect corneal epithelial cell monolayers in terms of integrity nor cell metabolic activity. Moreover, it was found that viable corneal cells adhered to the hydrogel, showing the typical morphology of epithelial cells and that such response was not influenced by the STF pre-conditioning of the hydrogel surface. The results of the study confirm that PVA-CNC hydrogel is a promising ophthalmic biomaterial, motivating future in vitro and in vivo biocompatibility studies.},

ABSTRACT = {The synthesis and characterization of an ABA triblock copolymer based on hydrophilic poly(2-methyl-2-oxazoline) (pMeOx) blocks A and a modestly hydrophobic poly(2-iso-butyl-2-oxazoline) (piBuOx) block B is described. Aqueous polymer solutions were prepared at different concentrations (1–20 wt %) and their thermogelling capability using visual observation was investigated at different temperatures ranging from 5 to 80 °C. As only a 20 wt % solution was found to undergo thermogelation, this concentration was investigated in more detail regarding its temperature-dependent viscoelastic profile utilizing various modes (strain or temperature sweep). The prepared hydrogels from this particular ABA triblock copolymer have interesting rheological and viscoelastic properties, such as reversible thermogelling and shear thinning, and may be used as bioink, which was supported by its very low cytotoxicity and initial printing experiments using the hydrogels. However, the soft character and low yield stress of the gels do not allow real 3D printing at this point.},

ABSTRACT = {This study reports on the processing of three-dimensional (3D) chitosan/bioactive glass composite scaffolds. On the one hand, chitosan, as a natural polymer, has suitable properties for tissue engineering applications but lacks bioactivity. On the other hand, bioactive glasses are known to be bioactive and to promote a higher level of bone formation than any other biomaterial type. However, bioactive glasses are hard, brittle, and cannot be shaped easily. Therefore, in the past years, researchers have focused on the processing of new composites. Difficulties in reaching composite materials made of polymer (synthetic or natural) and bioactive glass include: (i) The high glass density, often resulting in glass segregation, and (ii) the fast bioactive glass reaction when exposed to moisture, leading to changes in the glass reactivity and/or change in the polymeric matrix. Samples were prepared with 5, 15, and 30 wt% of bioactive glass S53P4 (BonAlive ®), as confirmed using thermogravimetric analysis. MicrO–Computed tomography and optical microscopy revealed a flaky structure with porosity over 80%. The pore size decreased when increasing the glass content up to 15 wt%, but increased back when the glass content was 30 wt%. Similarly, the mechanical properties (in compression) of the scaffolds increased for glass content up to 15%, but decreased at higher loading. Ions released from the scaffolds were found to lead to precipitation of a calcium phosphate reactive layer at the scaffold surface. This is a first indication of the potential bioactivity of these materials. Overall, chitosan/bioactive glass composite scaffolds were successfully produced with pore size, machinability, and ability to promote a calcium phosphate layer, showing promise for bone tissue engineering and the mechanical properties can justify their use in non-load bearing applications.},

ABSTRACT = {Proteins derived from the natural extracellular matrix like collagen or gelatin are common in clinical research, where they are prized for their biocompatibility and bioactivity. Cells are able to adhere, grow and remodel scaffolds based on these materials. Usually, collagen and gelatin are sourced from animal material, risking pathogenic transmission and inconsistent batch-to-batch product quality. A recombinant production in yeast circumvents these disadvantages by ensuring production with a reproducible quality in animal-component-free media. A gelatin mimetic protein, based on the alpha chain of human collagen I, was cloned in Pichia pastoris under the control of the methanol-inducible alcohol oxidase (AOX1) promoter. A producing clone was selected and cultivated at the 30 L scale. The protein was secreted into the cultivation medium and the final yield was 3.4 g·L−1. Purification of the target was performed directly from the cell-free medium by size exclusion chromatography. The gelatin mimetic protein was tested in cell culture for biocompatibility and for promoting cell adhesion. It supported cell growth and its performance was indistinguishable from animal-derived gelatin. The gelatin-mimetic protein represents a swift strategy to produce recombinant and human-based extracellular matrix proteins for various biomedical applications.},

ABSTRACT = {Failure of the cement mantle in total hip arthroplasty is not a simple phenomenon. Cracking, which can be caused by crack initiation and repeated loading, can cause loosening of the acetabular liner component. A previous study showed that addition of a metal layer between the liner and acetabular could reduce the stress at the contact surface of the cement mantle. This study elaborates on the performance of the additional layer. Several material properties of the layer were simulated using finite element analysis for maximum performance. A static contact analysis was used to simulate the stresses at the contact surface of the cement mantle. The results show that an additional layer of cobalt chrome produced the best performance.},

ABSTRACT = {Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) infections may lead to severe damage of the cornea, mucosa, and skin. The highly aggressive nature of P. aeruginosa and the rise in multi-drug resistance, particularly in nosocomial settings, lead to an increased risk for permanent tissue damage and potentially death. Thus, a growing need exists to develop alternative treatments to reduce both the occurrence of bacterial infection and biofilm development, as well as pathological progression post-infection. Silk derived from Bombyx mori silkworms serves as a unique biomaterial that is biocompatible with low immunogenicity and high versatility, and thereby ideal for stabilizing therapeutics. In this study, we assessed the cytotoxicity of P. aeruginosa on human corneal stromal stem cells and two mucosal cell lines (Caco-2 and HT29-MTX). To determine whether antibiotic-immobilized scaffolds can serve as alternative therapeutics to free, diffuse forms, we developed novel gentamicin-conjugated silk films as functional scaffolds and compared antimicrobial effects and free gentamicin. The advantages of generating a surface coating with a covalently-bound antibiotic may reduce potential side-effects associated with free gentamicin, as well as limit the diffusion of the drug. Our results suggest that gentamicin conjugated to native silk and carboxyl-enriched silk inhibits P. aeruginosa growth. Development of stabilized antibiotic treatments with surface toxicity selective against bacteria may serve as an alternative approach to treat active infections, as well as potential prophylactic use as coatings in high-risk cases, such as post-surgical complications or prolonged hospitalization.},

ABSTRACT = {The controlled release or delivery of proteins encapsulated in micro/nanospheres is an emerging strategy in regenerative medicine. For this, micro/nanospheres made from alginate have drawn considerable attention for the use as a protein delivery device because of their mild fabrication process, inert nature, non-toxicity and biocompatibility. Though promising, one key issue associated with using alginate micro/nanospheres is the burst release of encapsulated protein at the beginning of the release, which may be responsible for exerting toxic side effects and poor efficiency of the delivery device. To address this issue, this study aimed to investigate the effect of process parameters of fabricating protein-loaded alginate nanospheres on the initial burst release. The alginate nanospheres were prepared via a combination of water-in-oil emulsification and the external gelation method and loaded with bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a model protein. The examined process parameters included alginate concentration, ionic cross-linking time and drying time. Once fabricated, the nanospheres were then subjected to the examination of BSA release, as well as the characterization of their morphology, size, and encapsulation efficiency. Our results revealed that by properly adjusting the process parameters, the initial burst release can be reduced by 13%. Taken together, our study demonstrates that regulating process parameters of fabricating alginate nanospheres is a possible means to reduce the initial burst release.},

ABSTRACT = {Compared with platelet-rich plasma, the preparation of platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) is simple and has not been overly modified. However, it was recently demonstrated that centrifugation conditions influence the composition of PRF and that silica microparticles from silica-coated plastic tubes can enter the PRF matrix. These factors may also modify platelet distribution. To examine these possibilities, we prepared PRF matrices using various types of blood-collection tubes (plain glass tubes and silica-containing plastic tubes) and different centrifugation speeds. The protocols of concentrated growth factors and advanced-PRF represented high- and low-speed centrifugation, respectively. Platelet distribution in the PRF matrix was examined immunohistochemically. Using low-speed centrifugation, platelets were distributed homogeneously within the PRF matrix regardless of tube types. In high-speed centrifugation, platelets were distributed mainly on one surface region of the PRF matrix in glass tubes, whereas in silica-coated tubes, platelet distribution was commonly more diffusive than in glass tubes. Therefore, both blood-collection tube types and centrifugal conditions appeared to influence platelet distribution in the PRF matrix. Platelets distributed in the deep regions of the PRF matrix may contribute to better growth factor retention and release. However, clinicians should be careful in using silica-coated tubes because their silica microparticles may be a health hazard.},

ABSTRACT = {Apical periodontitis is a biofilm-mediated disease; therefore, an antimicrobial approach is essential to cure or prevent its development. In the quest for efficient strategies to achieve this objective, antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) has emerged as an alternative to classical endodontic irrigation solutions and antibiotics. The aim of the present critical review is to summarize the available evidence on photosensitizers (PSs) which has been confirmed in numerous studies from diverse areas combined with several antimicrobial strategies, as well as emerging options in order to optimize their properties and effects that might be translational and useful in the near future in basic endodontic research. Published data notably support the need for continuing the search for an ideal endodontic photosensitizer, that is, one which acts as an excellent antimicrobial agent without causing toxicity to the human host cells or presenting the risk of tooth discoloration. The current literature on experimental studies mainly relies on assessment of mixed disinfection protocols, combining approaches which are already available with aPDT as an adjunct therapy. In this review, several approaches concerning aPDT efficiency are appraised, such as the use of bacteriophages, biopolymers, drug and light delivery systems, efflux pump inhibitors, negative pressure systems, and peptides. The authors also analyzed their combination with other approaches for aPDT improvement, such as sonodynamic therapy. All of the aforementioned techniques have already been tested, and we highlight the biological challenges of each formulation, predicting that the collected information may encourage the development of other effective photoactive materials, in addition to being useful in endodontic basic research. Moreover, special attention is dedicated to studies on detailed conditions, aPDT features with a focus on PS enhancer strategies, and the respective final antimicrobial outcomes. From all the mentioned approaches, the two which are most widely discussed and which show the most promising outcomes for endodontic purposes are drug delivery systems (with strong development in nanoparticles) and PS solubilizers.},

ABSTRACT = {Directed enzyme prodrug therapy (DEPT) involves the delivery of a prodrug-activating enzyme to a solid tumour site, followed by the subsequent activation of an administered prodrug. One of the most studied enzyme–prodrug combinations is the nitroreductase from Escherichia coli (NfnB) with the prodrug CB1954 [5-(aziridin-1-yl)-2,4-dinitro-benzamide]. One of the major issues faced by DEPT is the ability to successfully internalize the enzyme into the target cells. NfnB has previously been genetically modified to contain cysteine residues (NfnB-Cys) which bind to gold nanoparticles for a novel DEPT therapy called magnetic nanoparticle directed enzyme prodrug therapy (MNDEPT). One cellular internalisation method is the use of cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs), which aid cellular internalization of cargo. Here the cell-penetrating peptides: HR9 and Pep-1 were tested for their ability to conjugate with NfnB-Cys. The conjugates were further tested for their potential use in MNDEPT, as well as conjugating with the delivery vector intended for use in MNDEPT and tested for the vectors capability to penetrate into cells.},

ABSTRACT = {Bismuth oxide (monoclinic α-Bi2O3) and zirconium oxide (monoclinic ZrO2) are the most popular radiopacifiers in commercial Portland cement-based endodontic restoratives, yet their effects on the setting and hydration reactions are not fully understood. This study compares the impact of 20 wt.% of Bi2O3 or ZrO2 on the early hydration reactions and C–S–H gel structure of white Portland cement (WPC). Cement paste samples were hydrated at 37.5 °C prior to analysis by 29Si and 27Al magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy at 3 h and 24 h, and transmission electron microscopy at 3 h. Initial and final setting times were determined using a Vicat apparatus and reaction kinetics were monitored by isothermal conduction calorimetry. Bi2O3 was found to prolong initial and final setting times and retard the degree of hydration by 32% at 24 h. Heat evolution during the acceleration and deceleration phases of the hydration process was reduced and the exotherm arising from renewed ettringite formation was delayed and diminished in the presence of Bi2O3. Conversely, ZrO2 had no significant impact on either setting time; although, it accelerated hydration by 23% within 24 h. Increases in the mean silicate chain length and the extent of aluminum substitution in the C–S–H gel were observed in the presence of both radiopacifying agents after 24 h relative to those of the unblended WPC. The Bi2O3 and ZrO2 particles remained intact within the cement matrix and neither bismuth nor zirconium was chemically incorporated in the hydration products.},

ABSTRACT = {The purpose of the present study was to measure and compare the insertion torque, removal torque, and the implant stability quotient by resonance frequency analysis in different polyurethane block densities of two implant macrogeometries. Four different polyurethane synthetic bone blocks were used with three cortical thickness: Bone 1 with a cortical thickness of 1 mm, Bone 2 with a cortical thickness of 2 mm, Bone 3 with a cortical thickness of 3 mm, and Bone 4, which was totally cortical. Four groups were created in accordance with the implant macrogeometry (n = 10 per group) and surface treatment: G1—regular implant design without surface treatment; G2—regular implant design with surface treatment; G3—new implant design without surface treatment; G4—new implant design with surface treatment. All implants used were 4 mm in diameter and 10 mm in length and manufactured in commercially pure titanium (grade IV) by Implacil De Bortoli (São Paulo, Brazil). The implants were installed using a computed torque machine, and following installation of the implant, the stability quotient (implant stability quotient, ISQ) values were measured in two directions using Osstell devices. The data were analyzed by considering the 5% level of significance. All implant groups showed similar mean ISQ values without statistical differences (p > 0.05), for the same synthetic bone block: for Bone 1, the value was 57.7 ± 3.0; for Bone 2, it was 58.6 ± 2.2; for Bone 3, it was 60.6 ± 2.3; and for Bone 4, it was 68.5 ± 2.8. However, the insertion torque showed similar higher values for the regular macrogeometry (G1 and G2 groups) in comparison with the new implant macrogeometry (G3 and G4 groups). The analysis of the results found that primary stability does not simply depend on the insertion torque but also on the bone quality. In comparison with the regular implant macrogeometry, the new implant macrogeometry decreased the insertion torque without affecting the implant stability quotient values.},

ABSTRACT = {Calcium phosphates (CaPs) are one of the most widely used synthetic materials for bone grafting applications in the orthopedic industry. Recent trends in synthetic bone graft applications have shifted towards the incorporation of metal trace elements that extend the performance of CaPs to have osteoinductive properties. The objective of this study is to investigate the effects of silicon (Si) and zinc (Zn) dopants in highly porous tricalcium phosphate (TCP) scaffolds on late-stage osteoblast cell differentiation markers. In this study, an oil emulsion method is utilized to fabricate highly porous SiO2 doped β-TCP (Si-TCP) and ZnO doped β-TCP (Zn-TCP) scaffolds through the incorporation of 0.5 wt.% SiO2 and 0.25 wt.% ZnO, respectively, to the β-TCP scaffold. Reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is utilized to analyze the mRNA expression of osteoprotegerin (OPG), receptor activator of nuclear kappa beta ligand (RANKL), bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2), and runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) at the later stage of osteoblast differentiation, day 21 and day 28. Results show that the addition of Si and Zn to the β-TCP structure inhibited the β to α-TCP phase transformation and enhance the density without affecting the dissolution properties. Normal BMP-2 and Runx2 transcriptions are observed in both Si-TCP and Zn-TCP scaffolds at the initial time point, as demonstrated by RT-qPCR. Moreover, the addition of both Si and Zn positively regulate the osteoprotegerin: receptor activator of nuclear factor k-β ligand (OPG:RANKL) ratio at 21-days for Si-TCP and Zn-TCP scaffolds. These results demonstrate the effects of Si and Zn doped porous β-TCP scaffolds on the upregulation of osteoblast marker gene expression including OPG, RANKL, BMP-2, and Runx2, indicating the role of trace elements on the effective regulation of late-stage osteoblast cell differentiation markers.},

ABSTRACT = {Transmucosal drug delivery is a promising avenue to improve therapeutic efficacy through localized therapeutic administration. Drug delivery systems that increase retention in the mucosal layer are needed to improve efficiency of such transmucosal platforms. However, the applicability of such systems is often limited by the range of chemistries and properties that can be achieved. Here we present the design and implementation of silk-elastin-like proteins (SELPs) with mucoadhesive properties. SELP-based micellar-like nanoparticles provide a system to tailor chemical and physical properties through genetic engineering of the SELP sequence, which enables the fabrication of nanoparticles with specific chemical and physical features. Analysis of the adhesion of four different SELP-based nanoparticle systems in an artificial mucus system, as well as in in vitro cellular assays indicates that addition of mucoadhesive chemical features on the SELP systems increases retention of the particles in mucosal environments. The results indicated that SELP-based nanoparticles provide a useful approach to study and develop transmucosal protein drug delivery system with unique mucoadhesive properties. Future studies will serve to further expand the range of achievable properties, as well as the utilization of SELPs to fabricate mucoadhesive materials for in vivo testing.},

ABSTRACT = {To date, extensive studies have been conducted to assess diverse types of sutures. But there is a paucity of data regarding biomechanical properties of commonly used suture materials. In the current experiment, we compared biomechanical properties and biocompatibility, such as tensile strength and elongation, the degree of bovine serum albumin (BSA) release, in vitro cytotoxicity and ex vivo frictional properties, between a non-absorbable elastic thread (NAT; HansBiomed Co. Ltd., Seoul, Korea) (NAT-R: NAT with a rough surface, NAT-S: NAT with a smooth surface) and the Elasticum® (Korpo SRL, Genova, Italy). The degree of tensile strength and elongation of Si threads was significantly higher in both the NAT-R and -S as compared with the Elasticum® (p < 0.05). Moreover, the degree of tensile strength and elongation of PET threads was significantly lower in both NAT-R and -S as compared with the Elasticum® (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the degree of tensile strength and elongation of braided Si/PET threads was significantly lower in NAT-S as compared with NAT-R and Elasticum® (p < 0.05). The degree of BSA release was significantly higher in the NAT-R as compared with Elasticum® and NAT-S throughout a 2-h period in the descending order (p < 0.05). The degree of cell viability was significantly higher in both NAT-R and -S as compared with Elasticum® (p < 0.05). The degree of coefficient of friction as well as the frictional force and strength was significantly higher in NAT-R as compared with NAT-S and Elasticum® (p < 0.05). NAT had a higher degree of biomechanical properties and biocompatibility as compared with Elasticum®. But further experimental and clinical studies are warranted to compare the efficacy, safety, and potential role as a carrier for drug delivery between NAT and Elasticum®.},

ABSTRACT = {Polycaprolactone (PCL), a hydrophobic-degradable polyester, has been widely investigated and extensively developed, to increase the biocompatibility for tissue engineering. This research was the first trial to evaluate the intrinsic biological responses of human Wharton’s Jelly Mesenchymal Stem Cells (hWJMSCs) cultured on alkaline hydrolysis and low-pressure oxygen plasma modified 2D and 3D PCL scaffolds, without adding any differentiation inducers; this has not been reported before. Four types of the substrate were newly established: 2D plasma-treated PCL (2D-TP), 2D non-plasma-treated PCL (2D-NP), 3D plasma-treated PCL (3D-TP), and 3D non-plasma-treated PCL (3D-NP). Physicochemical characterization revealed that only plasma-treated PCL scaffolds significantly increased the hydrophilicity and % oxygen/carbon ratio on the surfaces. The RMS roughness of 3D was higher than 2D conformation, whilst the plasma-treated surfaces were rougher than the non-plasma treated ones. The cytocompatibility test demonstrated that the 2D PCLs enhanced the initial cell attachment in comparison to the 3Ds, indicated by a higher expression of focal adhesion kinase. Meanwhile, the 3Ds promoted cell proliferation and migration as evidence of higher cyclin-A expression and filopodial protrusion, respectively. The 3Ds potentially protected the cell from apoptosis/necrosis but also altered the pluripotency/differentiation-related gene expression. In summary, the different configuration and surface properties of PCL scaffolds displayed the significant potential and effectiveness for facilitating stem cell growth and differentiation in vitro. The cell–substrate interactions on modified surface PCL may provide some information which could be further applied in substrate architecture for stem cell accommodation in cell delivery system for tissue repair.},

ABSTRACT = {Total hip arthroplasty (THA) is a surgical procedure for the replacement of hip joints with artificial prostheses. Several approaches are currently employed in the treatment of this kind of defect. Overall, the most common method involves using a quite invasive metallic support (a Burch–Schneider ring). Moreover, valid alternatives and less invasive techniques still need to be supported by novel material development. In this work, we evaluated the performance of SmartBone®, a xenohybrid bone graft composed of a bovine bone matrix reinforced with biodegradable polymers and collagen, as an effective support in acetabular prosthesis reconstruction. Specifically, the material’s mechanical properties were experimentally determined (E = ~1.25 GPa, Ef = ~0.34 GPa, and Et = ~0.49 GPa) and used for simulation of the hip joint system with a SmartBone® insert. Moreover, a comparison with a similar case treated with a Burch–Schneider ring was also conducted. It was found that it is possible to perform THA revision surgeries without the insertion of an invasive metal support and it can be nicely combined with SmartBone®’s osteointegration characteristics. The material can withstand the loads independently (σmax = ~12 MPa) or be supported by a thinner titanium plate in contact with the bone in the worst cases. This way, improved bone regeneration can be achieved.},

ABSTRACT = {Phosphoserine modified cements (PMC) exhibit unique properties, including strong adhesion to tissues and biomaterials. While TTCP-PMCs remodel into bone in vivo, little is known regarding the bioactivity and physiochemical changes that occur during resorption. In the present study, changes in the mechanical strength and composition were evaluated for 28 days, for three formulations of αTCP based PMCs. PMCs were significantly stronger than unmodified cement (38–49 MPa vs. 10 MPa). Inclusion of wollastonite in PMCs appeared to accelerate the conversion to hydroxyapatite, coincident with slight decrease in strength. In non-wollastonite PMCs the initial compressive strength did not change after 28 days in PBS (p > 0.99). Dissolution/degradation of PMC was evaluated in acidic (pH 2.7, pH 4.0), and supersaturated fluids (simulated body fluid (SBF)). PMCs exhibited comparable mass loss (<15%) after 14 days, regardless of pH and ionic concentration. Electron microscopy, infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray analysis revealed that significant amounts of brushite, octacalcium phosphate, and hydroxyapatite reprecipitated, following dissolution in acidic conditions (pH 2.7), while amorphous calcium phosphate formed in SBF. In conclusion, PMC surfaces remodel into metastable precursors to hydroxyapatite, in both acidic and neutral environments. By tuning the composition of PMCs, durable strength in fluids, and rapid transformation can be obtained.},

ABSTRACT = {Despite on-going medical advances, ovarian cancer survival rates have stagnated. In order to improve IP delivery of platinum-based antineoplastics, we aimed to develop a sustained drug delivery system for carboplatin (CPt). Toward this aim, we pursued a double emulsion process for obtaining CPt-loaded microcapsules composed of poly(ethylene terephthalate-ethylene dilinoleate) (PET-DLA) copolymer. We were able to obtain PET-DLA microspheres in the targeted size range of 10–25 µm (median: 18.5 µm), to reduce intraperitoneal clearance by phagocytosis and lymphoid transit. Empty microspheres showed the lack of toxicity in vitro. The double emulsion process yielded 2.5% w/w CPt loading and obtained microcapsules exhibited sustained (>20 day) zero-order release. The encapsulated CPt was confirmed to be bioavailable, as the microcapsules demonstrated efficacy against human ovarian adenocarcinoma (SK-OV-3) cells in vitro. Following intraperitoneal injection in mice, we did not observe adhesions, only mild, clinically-insignificant, local inflammatory response. Tissue platinum levels, monitored over 14 days using atomic absorption spectroscopy, revealed low burst and reduced systemic uptake (plasma, kidney), as compared to neat carboplatin injection. Overall, the results demonstrate the potential of the developed microencapsulation system for long-term intraperitoneal sustained release of carboplatin for the treatment of ovarian cancer.},

ABSTRACT = {In this study, we have prepared a series of 4- and 6-arm star-shaped polymers with varying molecular weight and hydrophobicity in order to provide insight into the role and relationship that shape and composition have on the binding and protecting of oral relevant surfaces (hydroxyapatite, HAP) from bacteria colonization. Star-shaped acrylic acid polymers were prepared by free-radical polymerization in the presence of chain transfer agents with thiol groups, and their binding to the HAP surfaces and subsequent bacteria repulsion was measured. We observed that binding was dependent on both polymer shape and hydrophobicity (star vs. linear), but their relative efficacy to reduce oral bacteria attachment from surfaces was dependent on their hydrophobicity only. We further measured the macroscopic effects of these materials to modify the mucin-coated HAP surfaces through contact angle experiments; the degree of angle change was dependent on the relative hydrophobicity of the materials suggesting future in vivo efficacy. The results from this study highlight that star-shaped polymers represent a new material platform for the development of dental applications to control bacterial adhesion which can lead to tooth decay, with various compositional and structural aspects of materials being vital to effectively design oral care products.},

ABSTRACT = {The aims of this study were to evaluate the physicochemical and mechanical properties, antimicrobial (AM) functionality, and cytotoxic potential of novel dental polymers containing quaternary ammonium and trimethoxysilyl functionalities (e.g., N-(2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl)-N,N-dimethyl-3-(trimethoxysilyl)propan-1-aminium iodide (AMsil1) and N-(2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl)-N,N-dimethyl-11-(trimethoxysilyl)undecan-1-aminium bromide (AMsil2)). AMsil1 or AMsil2 were incorporated into light-cured (camphorquinone + ethyl-4-N,N-dimethylamino benzoate) urethane dimethacrylate (UDMA)/polyethylene glycol-extended UDMA/ethyl 2-(hydroxymethyl)acrylate (EHMA) resins (hereafter, UPE resin) at 10 or 20 mass %. Cytotoxic potential was assessed by measuring viability and metabolic activity of immortalized mouse connective tissue and human gingival fibroblasts in direct contact with monomers. AMsil–UPE resins were evaluated for wettability by contact angle measurements and degree of vinyl conversion (DVC) by near infra-red spectroscopy analyses. Mechanical property evaluations entailed flexural strength (FS) and elastic modulus (E) testing of copolymer specimens. The AM properties were assessed using Streptococcus mutans (planktonic and biofilm forms) and Porphyromonas gingivalis biofilm. Neither AMsil exhibited significant toxicity in direct contact with cells at biologically relevant concentrations. Addition of AMsils made the UPE resin more hydrophilic. DVC values for the AMsil–UPE copolymers were 2–31% lower than that attained in the UPE resin control. The mechanical properties (FS and E) of AMsil–UPE specimens were reduced (11–57%) compared to the control. Compared to UPE resin, AMsil1–UPE and AMsil2–UPE (10% mass) copolymers reduced S. mutans biofilm 4.7- and 1.7-fold, respectively (p ≤ 0.005). Although not statistically different, P. gingivalis biofilm biomass on AMsil1–UPE and AM AMsil2–UPE copolymer disks were lower (71% and 85%, respectively) than that observed with a commercial AM dental material. In conclusion, the AM function of new monomers is not inundated by their toxicity towards cells. Despite the reduction in mechanical properties of the AMsil–UPE copolymers, AMsil2 is a good candidate for incorporation into multifunctional composites due to the favorable overall hydrophilicity of the resins and the satisfactory DVC values attained upon light polymerization of AMsil-containing UDMA/PEG-U/EHMA copolymers.},

ABSTRACT = {Fe-based materials have increasingly been considered for the development of biodegradable cardiovascular stents. A wide range of in vitro and in vivo studies should be done to fully evaluate their biocompatibility. In this review, we summarized and analyzed the findings and the methodologies used to assess the biocompatibility of Fe materials. The majority of investigators drew conclusions about in vitro Fe toxicity based on indirect contact results. The setup applied in these tests seems to overlook the possible effects of Fe corrosion and does not allow for understanding of the complexity of released chemical forms and their possible impact on tissue. It is in particular important to ensure that test setups or interpretations of in vitro results do not hide some important mechanisms, leading to inappropriate subsequent in vivo experiments. On the other hand, the sample size of existing in vivo implantations is often limited, and effects such as local toxicity or endothelial function are not deeply scrutinized. The main advantages and limitations of in vitro design strategies applied in the development of Fe-based alloys and the correlation with in vivo studies are discussed. It is evident from this literature review that we are not yet ready to define an Fe-based material as safe or biocompatible.},

ABSTRACT = {Ultraviolet (UV) exposure triggers the abnormal production of reactive oxygen (ROS) species and the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) that are responsible for photoaging. Probiotics are widely used in healthcare and for immune enhancement. One probiotic, Lactobacillus buchneri is found in Kimchi. This study was aimed at assessing the anti-photoaging effect of plant extracts fermented with L. buchneri (PELB) to develop functional cosmetics. We investigated the anti-photoaging effect of PELB in a UVB-induced photoaging in vitro model and selected effective extracts using the elastase inhibition assay, ELISA for Type I procollagen and collagenase-1, and quantitative real time PCR. Normal human dermal fibroblasts and epidermal keratinocytes were pre-treated with PELB and exposed to UVB. We found that PELB decreased elastase activity and increased type I collagen expression in a UVB-induced photoaging in vitro model. In addition, PELB greatly reduced collagenase activity and MMP mRNA levels in a UVB-induced photoaging in vitro model. Furthermore, PELB promoted the expression of moisture factor and anti-oxidant enzymes in a UVB-induced photoaging in vitro model. These results indicated that the PELB could be potential candidates for the protective effects against UVB-induced photoaging. Overall, these results suggest that PELB might be useful natural components of cosmetic products.},

ABSTRACT = {Microparticles (MPs) with controlled morphologies and sizes have been investigated by several researchers due to their importance in pharmaceutical, ceramic, cosmetic, and food industries to just name a few. In particular, the electrospray (ES) technique has been shown to be a viable alternative for the development of single particles with different dimensions, multiple layers, and varied morphologies. In order to adjust these properties, it is necessary to optimize different experimental parameters, such as polymer solvent, voltage, flow rate (FR), type of collectors, and distance between the collector and needle tip, which will all be highlighted in this review. Moreover, the influence and contributions of each of these parameters on the design and fabrication of polymeric MPs are described. In addition, the most common configurations of ES systems for this purpose are discussed, for instance, the main configuration of an ES system with monoaxial, coaxial, triaxial, and multi-capillary delivery. Finally, the main types of collectors employed, types of synthesized MPs and their applications specifically in the pharmaceutical and biomedical fields will be emphasized. To date, ES is a promising and versatile technology with numerous excellent applications in the pharmaceutical and biomaterials field and such MPs generated should be employed for the improved treatment of cancer, healing of bone, and other persistent medical problems.},

ABSTRACT = {Matrix-assisted chondrocyte transplantation (MACT) is of great interest for the treatment of patients with cartilage lesions. However, the roles of the matrix properties in modulating cartilage tissue integration during MACT recovery have not been fully understood. The objective of this study was to uncover the effects of substrate mechanics on the integration of implanted chondrocyte-laden hydrogels with native cartilage tissues. To this end, agarose hydrogels with Young’s moduli ranging from 0.49 kPa (0.5%, w/v) to 23.08 kPa (10%) were prepared and incorporated into an in vitro human cartilage explant model. The hydrogel-cartilage composites were cultivated for up to 12 weeks and harvested for evaluation via scanning electron microscopy, histology, and a push-through test. Our results demonstrated that integration strength at the hydrogel-cartilage interface in the 1.0% (0.93 kPa) and 2.5% (3.30 kPa) agarose groups significantly increased over time, whereas hydrogels with higher stiffness (>8.78 kPa) led to poor integration with articular cartilage. Extensive sprouting of extracellular matrix in the interfacial regions was only observed in the 0.5% to 2.5% agarose groups. Collectively, our findings suggest that while neocartilage development and its integration with native cartilage are modulated by substrate elasticity, an optimal Young’s modulus (3.30 kPa) possessed by agarose hydrogels is identified such that superior quality of tissue integration is achieved without compromising tissue properties of implanted constructs.},

ABSTRACT = {The insufficient radiopacity of dental adhesives applied under composite restorations makes the radiographic diagnosis of recurrent caries challenging. Consequently, the misdiagnosis may lead to unnecessary replacement of restorations. The aims of this study were to formulate experimental dental adhesives containing cerium dioxide (CeO2) and investigate the effects of different loadings of CeO2 on their radiopacity and degree of conversion for the first time. CeO2 was characterized by X-ray diffraction analysis, Fourier transforms infrared spectroscopy, and laser diffraction for particle size analysis. Experimental dental adhesives were formulated with CeO2 as the inorganic filler with loadings ranging from 0.36 to 5.76 vol.%. The unfilled adhesive was used as a control. The studied adhesives were evaluated for dispersion of CeO2 in the polymerized samples, degree of conversion, and radiopacity. CeO2 presented a monoclinic crystalline phase, peaks related to Ce-O bonding, and an average particle size of around 16 µm. CeO2 was dispersed in the adhesive, and the addition of these particles increased the adhesives’ radiopacity (p < 0.05). There was a significant decrease in the degree of conversion with CeO2 loadings higher than 1.44 vol.%. However, all materials showed a similar degree of conversion in comparison to commercially available adhesives. CeO2 particles were investigated for the first time as a promising compound to improve the radiopacity of the dental adhesives.},

ABSTRACT = {In the last decade, the use of photolithography for the fabrication of structured substrates with controlled morphological patterns that are able to interact with cells at micrometric and nanometric size scales is strongly growing. A promising simple and versatile microfabrication method is based on the physical mass transport induced by visible light in photosensitive azobenzene-containing polymers (or azopolymers). Such light-driven material transport produces a modulation of the surface of the azopolymer film, whose geometry is controlled by the intensity and the polarization distributions of the irradiated light. Herein, two anisotropic structured azopolymer films have been used as substrates to evaluate the effects of topological signals on the in vitro response of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). The light-induced substrate patterns consist of parallel microgrooves, which are produced in a spatially confined or over large-scale areas of the samples, respectively. The analysis of confocal optical images of the in vitro hMSC cells grown on the patterned films offered relevant information about cell morphology—i.e., nuclei deformation and actin filaments elongation—in relation to the geometry and the spatial extent of the structured area of substrates. The results, together with the possibility of simple, versatile, and cost-effective light-induced structuration of azopolymers, promise the successful use of these materials as anisotropic platforms to study the cell guidance mechanisms governing in vitro tissue formation.},

ABSTRACT = {This in vitro study evaluated the effect of myristyltrimethylammonium bromide (MYTAB) on the physical, chemical, and biological properties of an experimental dental resin. The resin was formulated with dental dimetacrylate monomers and a photoinitiator/co-initiator system. MYTAB was added at 0.5 (G0.5%), 1 (G1%), and 2 (G2%) wt %, and one group remained without MYTAB and was used as the control (GCtrl). The resins were analyzed for the polymerization kinetics, degree of conversion, ultimate tensile strength (UTS), antibacterial activity against Streptococcus mutans, and cytotoxicity against human keratinocytes. Changes in the polymerization kinetics profiling were observed, and the degree of conversion ranged from 57.36% (±2.50%) for G2% to 61.88% (±1.91%) for G0.5%, without a statistically significant difference among groups (p > 0.05). The UTS values ranged from 32.85 (±6.08) MPa for G0.5% to 35.12 (±5.74) MPa for GCtrl (p > 0.05). MYTAB groups showed antibacterial activity against biofilm formation from 0.5 wt % (p < 0.05) and against planktonic bacteria from 1 wt % (p < 0.05). The higher the MYTAB concentration, the higher the cytotoxic effect, without differences between GCtrl e G0.5% (p > 0.05). In conclusion, the addition of 0.5 wt % of MYTAB did not alter the physical and chemical properties of the dental resin and provided antibacterial activity without cytotoxic effect.},

ABSTRACT = {Hydroxyapatites modified with metal ions are the main inorganic components of bone tissue and are approved for use as components for biocomposites and coatings for surgical implants. This study examined prototypes of functional materials for bone implants based on hydroxyapatite modified with zinc ions. Zinc-modified hydroxyapatite was composed and synthesized. Using the XRD method, the phase composition was established. Using SEM, EPMA, and low-temperature nitrogen adsorption (BET) methods, surface properties were investigated. Antibacterial activity and biocompatibility have been established. The studied materials have antimicrobial activity; the samples did not cause significant changes in either the internal organs or the general condition of laboratory animals during the entire experiment.},

ABSTRACT = {Background: Indirect restorations using composites with ceramic fillings can be an alternative to ceramic veneering and direct composite restorations for the treatment of posterior teeth. The aim of this study was the evaluation of the mechanical and tribological properties of a ceromer. Materials and Methods: Sixty specimens were produced and divided into two groups: one control group not submitted to thermocycling (n = 20) and one test group submitted to 5000 cycles of thermocycling (n = 40). The studied parameters were microhardness, surface roughness and the coefficient of friction (scratch test). Results: The ceromer exhibits a reduction of polymerization shrinkage, higher wear, and fracture resistance than the composite resins. The studied ceromer presented good mechanical properties, even after being submitted to thermocycling. Roughness was the property most affected, increasing 25.8%, microhardness decreased by 10.5% and the coefficient of friction increased by 4.2%. Conclusions: In certain situations, ceromers can be an alternative to composite resins and ceramics, providing an aesthetic, conservative and longevity option.},

ABSTRACT = {Tissue engineering, with the goal of repairing or replacing damaged tissue and organs, has continued to make dramatic science-based advances since its origins in the late 1980’s and early 1990’s. Such advances are always multi-disciplinary in nature, from basic biology and chemistry through physics and mathematics to various engineering and computer fields. This review will focus its attention on two topics critical for tissue engineering liver development: (a) fluid flow, zonation, and drug screening, and (b) biomechanics, tissue stiffness, and fibrosis, all within the context of 3D structures. First, a general overview of various bioreactor designs developed to investigate fluid transport and tissue biomechanics is given. This includes a mention of computational fluid dynamic methods used to optimize and validate these designs. Thereafter, the perspective provided by computer simulations of flow, reactive transport, and biomechanics responses at the scale of the liver lobule and liver tissue is outlined, in addition to how bioreactor-measured properties can be utilized in these models. Here, the fundamental issues of tortuosity and upscaling are highlighted, as well as the role of disease and fibrosis in these issues. Some idealized simulations of the effects of fibrosis on lobule drug transport and mechanics responses are provided to further illustrate these concepts. This review concludes with an outline of some practical applications of tissue engineering advances and how efficient computational upscaling techniques, such as dual continuum modeling, might be used to quantify the transition of bioreactor results to the full liver scale.},

ABSTRACT = {The high demand for biodegradable implants in bone fracture fixations has dramatically increased the use of polymers for biomedical applications as well. However, the replacement of stainless steel and titanium screws by biodegradable materials represents one of the most critical aspects of biomechanics. In this study, the mechanical behavior of polycaprolactone (PCL) in tension and compression is examined. Driven by the advanced technology of computational mechanics, the fixation of the posterior malleolus fracture has been designed and analyzed. The core idea depicts the static analysis of screws made of PCL fixed in the ankle joint. The focus of the study is on this bio-absorbable, polymer-based material performance under constant compression. Parametric analysis is employed for the optimization of the PCL scaffold. Future studies will focus on the experimental verification of the numerical analysis results.},

ABSTRACT = {Low neural tissue extracellular matrix (ECM) content has led to the understudy of its effects on neural cells and tissue. Hyaluronic acid (HA) and laminin are major neural ECM components, but direct comparisons of their cellular effects could not be located in the literature. The current study uses human-induced pluripotent stem-cell-derived neural stem cells to assess the effects of HA, laminin, and HA with laminin-derived peptides IKVAV and LRE on cellular morphology, attachment, neurite extension and ECM remodeling. Increased attachment was observed on HA with and without IKVAV and LRE compared to laminin. Cellular morphology and neurite extension were similar on all surfaces. Using a direct binding inhibitor of Cav2.2 voltage gated calcium channel activity, a known binding partner of LRE, reduced attachment on HA with and without IKVAV and LRE and altered cellular morphology on surfaces with laminin or IKVAV and LRE. HA with IKVAV and LRE reduced the fluorescent intensity of fibronectin staining, but did not alter the localization of ECM remodeling enzymes matrix metalloprotease 2 and 9 staining compared to HA. Overall, the data indicate HA, IKVAV and LRE have complementary effects on human-induced pluripotent stem-cell-derived neural stem cell behavior.},

ABSTRACT = {Temperature-responsive nanocarrier systems using external stimuli are one of the most widely investigated stimuli-responsive strategies because heat is easy and safe to use for hyperthermia and controlled drug delivery. Polyamidoamine dendron lipids (PAMAM-DLs) composed of PAMAM dendron as head group and two alkyl chains can exhibit temperature-responsive morphological change through the attachment of suitable moieties to terminal of PAMAM dendron. In this study, oligo(ethylene glycol)s including ethoxy- or methoxy-diethylene glycols were attached to the terminals of PAMAM-DL, and temperature-responsive properties of their self-assemblies were evaluated by calorimetric and turbidity measurements. In the evaluation of temperature-responsive properties, ethoxy diethylene glycol (EDEG)-attached PAMAM-DL composed of two saturated alkyl chains and PAMAM dendron with 1st generation had lipid bilayer structure and suitable cloud point for the application as drug carrier. In vitro performances of the assemblies combining EDEG-attached PAMAM-DLs with cholesteryl-oxy-poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG-Chol) was evaluated using doxorubicin (DOX) as an anticancer drug. Cellular uptake of DOX-loaded EDEG-attached PAMAM-DL/PEG-Chol assemblies was promoted at 42 °C rather than 37 °C, resulting in an effective decrease in cell viability.},

ABSTRACT = {Drug-induced liver toxicity is one of the most common reasons for the failure of drugs in clinical trials and frequent withdrawal from the market. Reasons for such failures include the low predictive power of in vivo studies, that is mainly caused by metabolic differences between humans and animals, and intraspecific variances. In addition to factors such as age and genetic background, changes in drug metabolism can also be caused by disease-related changes in the liver. Such metabolic changes have also been observed in clinical settings, for example, in association with a change in liver stiffness, a major characteristic of an altered fibrotic liver. For mimicking these changes in an in vitro model, this study aimed to develop scaffolds that represent the rigidity of healthy and fibrotic liver tissue. We observed that liver cells plated on scaffolds representing the stiffness of healthy livers showed a higher metabolic activity compared to cells plated on stiffer scaffolds. Additionally, we detected a positive effect of a scaffold pre-coated with fetal calf serum (FCS)-containing media. This pre-incubation resulted in increased cell adherence during cell seeding onto the scaffolds. In summary, we developed a scaffold-based 3D model that mimics liver stiffness-dependent changes in drug metabolism that may more easily predict drug interaction in diseased livers.},

ABSTRACT = {We developed a procedure for fabricating movable biological cell structures using biodegradable materials on a microfluidic chip. A photo-cross-linkable biodegradable hydrogel gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) was used to fabricate arbitrary microstructure shapes under a microscope using patterned ultraviolet light. The GelMA microstructures were movable inside the microfluidic channel after applying a hydrophobic coating material. The fabricated microstructures were self-assembled inside the microfluidic chip using our method of fluid forcing. The synthesis procedure of GelMA was optimized by changing the dialysis temperature, which kept the GelMA at a suitable pH for cell culture. RLC-18 rat liver cells (Riken BioResource Research Center, Tsukuba, Japan) were cultured inside the GelMA and on the GelMA microstructures to check cell growth. The cells were then stretched for 1 day in the cell culture and grew well on the GelMA microstructures. However, they did not grow well inside the GelMA microstructures. The GelMA microstructures were partially dissolved after 4 days of cell culture because of their biodegradability after the cells were placed on the microstructures. The results indicated that the proposed procedure used to fabricate cell structures using GelMA can be used as a building block to assemble three-dimensional tissue-like cell structures in vitro inside microfluidic devices.},

ABSTRACT = {In recent years, mussel adhesive proteins have attracted much attention because they can form strong adhesive interface interactions with various substrates in a wet environment. Inspired by their catechol- and amine-based molecular structure, polydopamine (PDA), a dopamine derived synthetic eumelanin polymer, was recognized as a suitable bio-interface coating. PDA was successfully used to improve adhesion due to the availability of copious functional groups for covalently immobilizing biomolecules and anchoring reactive species and ions. Recently, it has been demonstrated that PDA and its derivatives can be successfully used for the surface modification of implants interfaces to modulate in vitro cellular responses in order to enhance the in vivo functionality of biomedical implants (i.e., prosthesis). Herein, we propose the development of multifunctional scaffolds based on polyε–caprolactone (PCL) electrospun fibers coated with PDA via electro fluid dynamic methods, by optimizing polymerization/oxidation reactions capable of driving PDA self–assembly, and, ultimately, investigating the effects on cell response. Morphological analyses have confirmed the possibility to obtain different surface topographies as a function of the coating process while in vitro studies proved the ability of PDA coating to interact with cells no compromising in vitro viability. In perspective, in vitro conductive properties of fibers will be further investigated in order to validate their promising use as bioconductive interfaces for tissue engineering applications.},

ABSTRACT = {Nanobiocomposites suitable for preparing skin compatible films by flat die extrusion were prepared by using plasticized poly(lactic acid) (PLA), poly(butylene succinate-co-adipate) (PBSA), and Chitin nanofibrils as functional filler. Chitin nanofibrils (CNs) were dispersed in the blends thanks to the preparation of pre-nanocomposites containing poly(ethylene glycol). Thanks to the use of a melt strength enhancer (Plastistrength) and calcium carbonate, the processability and thermal properties of bionanocomposites films containing CNs could be tuned in a wide range. Moreover, the resultant films were flexible and highly resistant. The addition of CNs in the presence of starch proved not advantageous because of an extensive chain scission resulting in low values of melt viscosity. The films containing CNs or CNs and calcium carbonate resulted biocompatible and enabled the production of cells defensins, acting as indirect anti-microbial. Nevertheless, tests made with Staphylococcus aureus and Enterobacter spp. (Gram positive and negative respectively) by the qualitative agar diffusion test did not show any direct anti-microbial activity of the films. The results are explained considering the morphology of the film and the different mechanisms of direct and indirect anti-microbial action generated by the nanobiocomposite based films.},

ABSTRACT = {Edible plants have been widely used in traditional therapeutics because of the biological activities of their natural ingredients, including anticancer, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties. Plant sap contains such medicinal substances and their secondary metabolites provide unique chemical structures that contribute to their therapeutic efficacy. Plant extracts are known to contain a variety of extracellular vesicles (EVs) but the effects of such EVs on various cancers have not been investigated. Here, we extracted EVs from four plants—Dendropanax morbifera, Pinus densiflora, Thuja occidentalis, and Chamaecyparis obtusa—that are known to have cytotoxic effects. We evaluated the cytotoxic effects of these EVs by assessing their ability to selectively reduce the viability of various tumor cell types compared with normal cells and low metastatic cells. EVs from D. morbifera and P. densiflora sap showed strong cytotoxic effects on tumor cells, whereas those from T. occidentalis and C. obtusa had no significant effect on any tumor cell types. We also identified synergistic effect of EVs from D. morbifera and P. densiflora saps on breast and skin tumor cells and established optimized treatment concentrations. Our findings suggest these EVs from plant sap as new candidates for cancer treatment.},

ABSTRACT = {In the cosmetic sector, natural and sustainable products with a high compatibility with skin, thus conjugating wellness with a green-oriented consumerism, are required by the market. Poly(hydroxyalkanoate) (PHA)/starch blends represent a promising alternative to prepare flexible films as support for innovative beauty masks, wearable after wetting and releasing starch and other selected molecules. Nevertheless, preparing these films by extrusion is difficult due to the high viscosity of the polymer melt at the temperature suitable for processing starch. The preparation of blends including poly(butylene succinate-co-adipate) (PBSA) or poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT) was investigated as a strategy to better modulate melt viscosity in view of a possible industrial production of beauty mask films. The release properties of films in water, connected to their morphology, was also investigated by extraction trials, infrared spectroscopy and stereo and electron microscopy. Then, the biocompatibility with cells was assessed by considering both mesenchymal stromal cells and keratinocytes. All the results were discussed considering the morphology of the films. This study evidenced the possibility of modulating thanks to the selection of composition and the materials processing of the properties necessary for producing films with tailored properties and processability for beauty masks.},

ABSTRACT = {A medium chain-length polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) was produced by Pseudomonas mendocina CH50 using a cheap carbon substrate, sugarcane molasses. A PHA yield of 14.2% dry cell weight was achieved. Chemical analysis confirmed that the polymer produced was a medium chain-length PHA, a copolymer of 3-hydroxyoctanoate and 3-hydroxydecanoate, P(3HO-co-3HD). Lime oil, an essential oil with known antimicrobial activity, was used as an additive to P(3HO-co-3HD) to confer antibacterial properties to this biodegradable polymer. The incorporation of lime oil induced a slight decrease in crystallinity of P(3HO-co-3HD) films. The antibacterial properties of lime oil were investigated using ISO 20776 against Staphylococcus aureus 6538P and Escherichia coli 8739, showing a higher activity against the Gram-positive bacteria. The higher activity of the oil against S. aureus 6538P defined the higher efficiency of loaded polymer films against this strain. The effect of storage on the antimicrobial properties of the loaded films was investigated. After one-year storage, the content of lime oil in the films decreased, causing a reduction of the antimicrobial activity of the materials produced. However, the films still possessed antibacterial activity against S. aureus 6538P.},

ABSTRACT = {Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) is widely used in joint arthroplasty to secure an implant to the host bone. Complications including fracture, bone loss and infection might cause failure of total knee arthroplasty (TKA), resulting in the need for revision total knee arthroplasty (rTKA). The goals of this paper are: (1) to identify the most common complications, outside of sepsis, arising from the application of PMMA following rTKA, (2) to discuss the current applications and drawbacks of employing PMMA in managing bone loss, (3) to review the role of PMMA in addressing bone infection following complications in rTKA. Papers published between 1970 to 2018 have been considered through searching in Springer, Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore, Engineering village, PubMed and weblinks. This review considers the use of PMMA as both a bone void filler and as a spacer material in two-stage revision. To manage bone loss, PMMA is widely used to fill peripheral bone defects whose depth is less than 5 mm and covers less than 50% of the bone surface. Treatment of bone infections with PMMA is mainly for two-stage rTKA where antibiotic-loaded PMMA is inserted as a spacer. This review also shows that using antibiotic-loaded PMMA might cause complications such as toxicity to surrounding tissue, incomplete antibiotic agent release from the PMMA, roughness and bacterial colonization on the surface of PMMA. Although PMMA is the only commercial bone cement used in rTKA, there are concerns associated with using PMMA following rTKA. More research and clinical studies are needed to address these complications.},

PEEK disks reinforced with carbon (CPEEK) or glass (GPEEK) fibers were polished, modified with PL and UV for 60 s, and the surface energy was calculated by measuring the contact angles. The disk surfaces were analyzed by X-ray photoemission spectroscopy. Shear bond strength testing was performed using a universal testing machine, and the fracture surfaces were observed by electron probe microanalyzer. Data were analyzed with one and two-way ANOVA and Tukey’s post-hoc test (p < 0.05). The surface energies were increased by the modifications, which created OH functional groups on the surfaces. The bond strengths of CPEEK were increased by PL, and those of GPEEK were increased by PL and UV, owing to chemical bonding at the interface.},

ABSTRACT = {A series of biocompatible high-porosity (up to 72.4%) TiZr-based porous bulk metallic glass (BMG) scaffolds were successfully fabricated by hot pressing a mixture of toxic element-free TiZr-based BMG powder and an Al particle space holder. The morphology of the fabricated scaffolds was similar to that of human bones, with pore sizes ranging from 75 to 250 μm. X-ray diffraction patterns and transmission electron microscopy images indicated that the amorphous structure of the TiZr-based BMG scaffolds remained in the amorphous state after hot pressing. Noncytotoxicity and extracellular calcium deposition of the TiZr-based BMG scaffolds at porosities of 32.8%, 48.8%, and 64.0% were examined by using the direct contact method. The results showed that the BMG scaffolds possess high cell viability and extracellular calcium deposition with average cell survival and deposition rates of approximately 170.1% and 130.9%, respectively. In addition, the resulting TiZr-based BMG scaffolds exhibited a considerable reduction in Young’s moduli from 56.4 to 2.3 GPa, compressive strength from 979 to 19 MPa, and bending strength from 157 MPa to 49 MPa when the porosity was gradually increased from 2.0% to 72.4%. Based on the aforementioned specific characteristics, TiZr-based BMG scaffolds can be considered as potential candidates for biomedical applications in the human body.},

ABSTRACT = {Background: Different augmentation techniques have been described in the literature in addition to the surgical treatment of proximal humeral fractures. The aim of this systematic review was to analyze the use of cements, bone substitutes, and other devices for the augmentation of proximal humeral fractures. Methods: A systematic review was conducted by using PubMed/MEDLINE, ISI Web of Knowledge, Cochrane Library, Scopus/EMBASE, and Google Scholar databases according the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines over the years 1966 to 2019. The search term “humeral fracture proximal” was combined with “augmentation”; “polymethylmethacrylate, PMMA”; “cement”; “bone substitutes”; “hydroxyapatite”; “calcium phosphates”; “calcium sulfate”; “cell therapies”, and “tissue engineering” to find the literature relevant to the topic under review. Results: A total of 10 clinical studies considered eligible for the review, with a total of 308 patients, were included. Mean age at the time of injury was 68.8 years (range of 58–92). The most commonly described techniques were reinforcing the screw–bone interface with bone PMMA cement (three studies), filling the metaphyseal void with synthetic bone substitutes (five studies), and enhancing structural support with metallic devices (two studies). Conclusion: PMMA cementation could improve screw-tip fixation. Calcium phosphate and calcium sulfate injectable composites provided good biocompatibility, osteoconductivity, and lower mechanical failure rate when compared to non-augmented fractures. Mechanical devices currently have a limited role. However, the available evidence is provided mainly by level III to IV studies, and none of the proposed techniques have been sufficiently studied.},

ABSTRACT = {Recently, the demand for the use of natural polymers in the cosmetic, biomedical, and sanitary sectors has been increasing. In order to meet specific functional properties of the products, usually, the incorporation of the active component is required. One of the main problems is enabling compatibility between hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces. Therefore, surface modification is necessary. Poly(lactide) (PLA) is a natural polymer that has attracted a lot ofattention in recent years. It is bio-based, can be produced from carbohydrate sources like corn, and it is biodegradable. The main goal of this work was the functionalization of PLA, inserting antiseptic and anti-inflammatory nanostructured systems based on chitin nanofibrils–nanolignin complexes ready to be used in the biomedical, cosmetics, and sanitary sectors. The specific challenge of this investigation was to increase the interaction between the hydrophobic PLA matrix with hydrophilic chitin–lignin nanoparticle complexes. First, chemical modification via the “grafting from” method using lactide oligomers was performed. Then, active coatings with modified and unmodified chitin–lignin nanoparticle complexes were prepared and applied on extruded PLA-based sheets. The chemical, thermal, and mechanical characterization of prepared samples was carried out and the obtained results were discussed.},

ABSTRACT = {Platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) consists of a matrix that provides the necessary elements for wound healing, acting as a biodegradable scaffold for cell migration, proliferation, and differentiation, in addition to the delivery of growth factors and angiogenesis. This study aims to determine the effectiveness of the autologous PRF in the treatment of wounds of different etiologies. We carried out a systematic review of randomized clinical trials, guided by the recommendations of the Cochrane Collaboration using the following databases: Pubmed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and CENTRAL. The search strategy resulted in the inclusion of ten studies that evaluated the use of PRF dressings for the healing of acute or chronic wounds of multiple etiologies. Among the 172 participants treated with PRF in wounds of varying etiologies and different segment times, 130 presented favorable events with the use of the intervention. Among the 10 studies included, only two of them did not demonstrate better results than the control group. The studies showed clinical heterogeneity, making it impossible to perform a meta-analysis. The findings do not provide enough evidence to support the routine use of PRF dressings as the first line of treatment for the healing of acute or chronic wounds of different etiologies. There was great variability in the application of the various protocols and the ways to prepare the PRF, resulting in clinical heterogeneity. Therefore, it makes it impossible to synthesize and to collect evidence from different types of studies in the meta-analysis, which affects the results and their proper discussion.},

ABSTRACT = {Chitin Lignin nanoparticles (CN-NL), standalone and encapsulating glycyrrhetic acid (GA), were applied on novel substrates for textiles to obtain antibacterial, antioxidant properties. Their homogeneous application is an important parameter that can strongly influence the final performance of the investigated textiles for its cosmetic and medical use. In this paper, hyperspectral imaging techniques combined with chemometric tools were investigated to study the distribution and quantification of CN-NL/GA on chitosan and CN-NL on pullulan substrates. To do so, samples of chitosan and pullulan impregnated with CN-NL/GA and CN-NL were analysed through Short Wave Infrared (SWIR) and Visible-Near Infrared (VisNIR) hyperspectral cameras. Two different chemometric tools for qualitative and quantitative analysis have been applied, principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least square regression (PLSR) models. Promising results were obtained in the VisNIR range, which made it possible for us to visualize the CN-NL/GA compound on chitosan and CN-NL on pullulan substrates. Additionally, the PLSR model results had determination coefficient ( R C 2 ) for calibration and cross-validation ( R C V 2 )   values of 0.983 and 0.857, respectively. Minimum values of root-mean-square error for calibration (RMSEC) and cross-validation (RMSECV) of CN-NL/GA were 0.333 and 0.993 g, respectively. The results demonstrate that hyperspectral imaging combined with chemometrics offers a powerful tool for studying the distribution on chitosan and pullulan substrates and to quantify the content of CN-NL/GA compounds on chitosan substrates.},

ABSTRACT = {A 200 nm plasma-enhanced chemical vapor-deposited SiC was used as a coating on dental ceramics to improve anti-bacterial properties for the applications of dental prosthesis. A thin SiO2 (20 nm) in the same system was deposited first, prior to SiC deposition, to improve the adhesion between SiC to dental ceramic. Silane and methane were the precursors for SiC deposition, and the SiO2 deposition employed silane and nitrous oxide as the precursors. SiC antimicrobial activity was evaluated on the proliferation of biofilm, Streptococcus sanguinis, and Streptococcus mutans on SiC-coated and uncoated dental ceramics for 24 h. The ceramic coating with SiC exhibited a biofilm coverage of 16.9%, whereas uncoated samples demonstrated a significantly higher biofilm coverage of 91.8%, measured with fluorescence and scanning electron microscopic images. The cytotoxicity of the SiC coating was evaluated using human periodontal ligament fibroblasts (HPdLF) by CellTiter-BlueCell viability assay. After 24 h of HPdLF cultivation, no obvious cytotoxicity was observed on the SiC coating and control group; both sets of samples exhibited similar cell adhesion and proliferation. SiC coating on a ceramic demonstrated antimicrobial activity without inducing cytotoxic effects.},

ABSTRACT = {Inert biomaterials used for auricular reconstruction, which is one of the most challenging and diverse tasks in craniofacial or head and neck surgery, often cause problems such as capsule formation, infection, and skin extrusion. To solve these problems, scaffold consisting of inert biomaterial, high-density polyethylene (Medpor®) encapsulated with neocartilage, biodegradable poly(DL-lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) was created using a tissue engineering strategy. PLGA scaffold without Medpor® was created to serve as the control. Scaffolds were vacuum-seeded with rabbit chondrocytes, freshly isolated from the ear by enzymatic digestion. Then, cell-seeded scaffolds were implanted subcutaneously in the dorsal pockets of nude mice. After 12 weeks, explants were analyzed by histological, biochemical, and mechanical evaluations. Although the PLGA group resulted in neocartilage formation, the PLGA–Medpor® group demonstrated improved outcome with the formation of well-surrounded cartilage around the implants with higher mechanical strength than the PLGA group, indicating that Medpor® has an influence on the structural strength of engineered cartilage. The presence of collagen and elastin fibers was evident in the histological section in both groups. These results demonstrated a novel method of coating implant material with engineered cartilage to overcome the limitations of using biodegradable scaffold in cartilage tissue regeneration. By utilizing the patient’s own chondrocytes, our proposed method may broaden the choice of implant materials while minimizing side effects and immune reaction for the future medical application.},

ABSTRACT = {Bioactive glass (BG) nanoparticles have wide applications in bone repair due to their bone-bonding and biodegradable nature. In this work, nanometric rod-shaped ternary SiO2-CaO-P2O5 bioactive glass particles were prepared through sol-gel chemistry followed by a base-induced hydrothermal process at 130 °C and 170 °C for various times up to 36 h. This facile, low-temperature and surfactant-free hydrothermal process has shown to be capable of producing uniform nanorods and nanowires. One-dimensional growth of nanorods and the characteristics of siloxane bridging networks were dependent on the hydrothermal temperature and time. Hardened bioactive composites were prepared from BG nanorods and cryo-milled poly(vinylpyrrolidone-co-triethoxyvinylsilane) in the presence of ammonium phosphate as potential bone graft biomaterials. Covalent crosslinking has been observed between the organic and inorganic components within these composites. The ultimate compressive strength and modulus values increased with increasing co-polymer content, reaching 27 MPa and 500 MPa respectively with 30% co-polymer incorporation. The materials degraded in a controlled non-linear manner when incubated in phosphate-buffered saline from 6 h to 14 days. Fibroblast cell attachment and spreading on the composite were not as good as the positive control surfaces and suggested that they may require protein coating in order to promote favorable cell interactions.},

ABSTRACT = {Background: Toothpastes containing nano-hydroxyapatite (n-HAp) substituted with metal ions provide calcium and phosphate ions to dental hard tissues, reducing demineralization, and promoting remineralization. Few data are available about the effect of these bioactive compounds on oral microbiota. Methods: This in vitro study evaluated the influence of two commercially-available substituted n-HAp-based toothpastes (α: Zn-carbonate substituted n-HAp; β: F, Mg, Sr-carbonate substituted n-HAp) on early colonization (EC, 12 h) and biofilm formation (BF, 24 h) by oral microbiota. Controls were brushed with distilled water. Artificial oral microcosm and Streptococcus mutans biofilms were developed using human enamel and a resin-based composite (RBC) as adherence surfaces. Two test setups, a shaking multiwell plate and a modified drip-flow reactor (MDFR), were used to simulate clinical conditions during the night (low salivary flow and clearance) and daytime, respectively. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS) was used to evaluate specimens’ surfaces after toothpaste treatment. Fluoride release from β toothpaste was evaluated. Viable adherent biomass was quantified by MTT assay, and biofilms’ morphology was highlighted using confocal microscopy. Results: EDS showed the presence of remnants from the tested toothpastes on both adherence surfaces. β toothpaste showed significantly lower EC and BF compared to control using the artificial oral microcosm model, while α toothpaste showed lower EC and BF compared to control, but higher EC and BF compared to β toothpaste. The effect shown by β toothpaste was, to a minimal extent, due to fluoride release. Interestingly, this result was seen on both adherence surfaces, meaning that the tested toothpastes significantly influenced EC and BF even on RBC surfaces. Furthermore, the effect of toothpaste treatments was higher after 12 h than 24 h, suggesting that toothbrushing twice a day is more effective than brushing once. Conclusions: The efficacy of these treatments in reducing microbial colonization of RBC surfaces may represent a promising possibility in the prevention of secondary caries.},

ABSTRACT = {Bioactive mineral-based dentin desensitizers that can quickly and effectively seal dentinal tubules and promote dentin mineralization are desired. This in vitro study evaluated a novel nanohydroxyapatite-based desensitizer, Predicta (PBD, Parkell), and its effect on bond strength of dental adhesives. Human dentin discs (2-mm thick) were subjected to 0.5 M EDTA to remove the smear layer and expose tubules, treated with PBD, and processed for surface and cross-sectional SEM examination before and after immersion in simulated body fluid (SBF) for four weeks (ISO 23317-2014). The effects of two dental desensitizers on the microshear bond strength of a universal adhesive and a two-step self-etch system were compared. SEM showed coverage and penetration of nanoparticles in wide tubules on the PBD-treated dentin at the baseline. After four weeks in SBF, untreated dentin showed amorphous mineral deposits while PBD-treated dentin disclosed a highly mineralized structure integrated with dentin. Desensitizers significantly reduced microshear bond strength test (MSBS) of adhesives by 15–20% on average, depending on the bonding protocol. In conclusion, PBD demonstrated effective immediate tubules sealing capability and promoted mineral crystal growth over dentin and into the tubules during SBF-storage. For bonding to desensitizer-treated dentin, a two-step self-etching adhesive or universal bond with phosphoric acid pretreatment are recommended.},

ABSTRACT = {The extracellular cell surface-associated and soluble heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is known to participate in the migration and invasion of tumor cells. Earlier, we demonstrated that plasma membrane-associated heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) bind the extracellular Hsp90 and thereby promote the Hsp90-mediated motility of tumor cells. Here, we showed that a conjugate of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid with gelatin (2,5-DHBA–gelatin), a synthetic polymer with heparin-like properties, suppressed the basal (unstimulated) migration and invasion of human glioblastoma A-172 and fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells, which was accompanied by the detachment of a fraction of Hsp90 from cell surface HSPGs. The polymeric conjugate also inhibited the migration/invasion of cells stimulated by exogenous soluble native Hsp90, which correlated with the inhibition of the attachment of soluble Hsp90 to cell surface HSPGs. The action of the 2,5-DHBA–gelatin conjugate on the motility of A-172 and HT1080 cells was similar to that of heparin. The results demonstrate a potential of the 2,5-DHBA–gelatin polymer for the development of antimetastatic drugs targeting cell motility and a possible role of extracellular Hsp90 in the suppression of the migration and invasion of tumor cells mediated by the 2,5-DHBA–gelatin conjugate and heparin.},

ABSTRACT = {One-dimensional (1D) materials allow for cutting-edge applications in biology, such as single-cell bioelectronics investigations, stimulation of the cellular membrane or the cytosol, cellular capture, tissue regeneration, antibacterial action, traction force investigation, and cellular lysis among others. The extraordinary development of this research field in the last ten years has been promoted by the possibility to engineer new classes of biointerfaces that integrate 1D materials as tools to trigger reconfigurable stimuli/probes at the sub-cellular resolution, mimicking the in vivo protein fibres organization of the extracellular matrix. After a brief overview of the theoretical models relevant for a quantitative description of the 1D material/cell interface, this work offers an unprecedented review of 1D nano- and microscale materials (inorganic, organic, biomolecular) explored so far in this vibrant research field, highlighting their emerging biological applications. The correlation between each 1D material chemistry and the resulting biological response is investigated, allowing to emphasize the advantages and the issues that each class presents. Finally, current challenges and future perspectives are discussed.},

ABSTRACT = {The article presents an original way of getting porous and mechanically strong CaSiO3-HAp ceramics, which is highly desirable for bone-ceramic implants in bone restoration surgery. The method combines wet and solid-phase approaches of inorganic synthesis: sol-gel (template) technology to produce the amorphous xonotlite (Ca6Si6O17·2OH) as the raw material, followed by its spark plasma sintering–reactive synthesis (SPS-RS) into ceramics. Formation of both crystalline wollastonite (CaSiO3) and hydroxyapatite (Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2) occurs “in situ” under SPS conditions, which is the main novelty of the method, due to combining the solid-phase transitions of the amorphous xonotlite with the chemical reaction within the powder mixture between CaO and CaHPO4. Formation of pristine HAp and its composite derivative with wollastonite was studied by means of TGA and XRD with the temperatures of the “in situ” interactions also determined. A facile route to tailor a macroporous structure is suggested, with polymer (siloxane-acrylate latex) and carbon (fibers and powder) fillers being used as the pore-forming templates. Microbial tests were carried out to reveal the morphological features of the bacterial film Pseudomonas aeruginosa that formed on the surface of the ceramics, depending on the content of HAp (0, 20, and 50 wt%).},

ABSTRACT = {Titanium nitride (TiN) and silicon carbide (SiC) adhesion properties to biofilm and the proliferation of human osteoblasts were studied. Quaternized titanium nitride (QTiN) was produced by converting the surface nitrogen on TiN to a positive charge through a quaternization process to further improve the antibacterial efficiency. The SiC required a nitridation within the plasma chamber of the surface layer before quaternization could be carried out to produce quaternized SiC (QSiC). The antimicrobial activity was evaluated on the reference strains of Porphyromonas gingivalis for 4 h by fluorescence microscopy using a live/dead viability kit. All the coatings exhibited a lower biofilm coverage compared to the uncoated samples (Ti—85.2%; TiN—24.22%; QTiN—11.4%; SiC—9.1%; QSiC—9.74%). Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) images confirmed the reduction in P. gingivalis bacteria on the SiC and TiN-coated groups. After 24 h of osteoblast cultivation on the samples, the cell adhesion was observed on all the coated and uncoated groups. Fluorescence images demonstrated that the osteoblast cells adhered and proliferated on the surfaces. TiN and SiC coatings can inhibit the attachment of Porphyromonas gingivalis and promote osteoblast adhesion on the titanium used for implants. These coatings may possess the ability to prevent the development of peri-implantitis and stimulate osteointegration.},

ABSTRACT = {Recently, silver (Ag) and copper (Cu) have been incorporated into a titanium (Ti) surface to realize their antibacterial property. This study investigated both the durability of the antibacterial effect and the surface change of the Ag- and Cu-incorporated porous titanium dioxide (TiO2) layer. Ag- and Cu-incorporated TiO2 layers were formed by micro-arc oxidation (MAO) treatment using the electrolyte with Ag and Cu ions. Ag- and Cu-incorporated specimens were incubated in saline during a period of 0–28 days. The changes in both the concentrations and chemical states of the Ag and Cu were characterized using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The durability of the antibacterial effects against Escherichia coli (E. coli) were evaluated by the international organization for standardization (ISO) method. As a result, the Ag- and Cu-incorporated porous TiO2 layers were formed on a Ti surface by MAO. The chemical state of Ag changed from Ag2O to metallic Ag, whilst that of Cu did not change by incubation in saline for up to 28 days. Cu existed as a stable Cu2O compound in the TiO2 layer during the 28 days of incubation in saline. The concentrations of Ag and Cu were dramatically decreased by incubation for up to 7 days, and remained a slight amount until 28 days.

ABSTRACT = {Among the biomaterials based on calcium phosphate, hydroxyapatite has been widely used due to its biocompatibility and osteoconduction. The substitution of the phosphate group by the carbonate group associated with the absence of heat treatment and low synthesis temperature leads to the formation of carbonated hydroxyapatite (CHA). The association of CHA with other metals (strontium, zinc, magnesium, iron, and manganese) produces amorphous calcium phosphate-containing metals (ACPMetals), which can optimize their properties and mimic biological apatite. This study aimed to evaluate the biocompatibility and biodegradation of ACPMetals in mice subcutaneous tissue. The materials were physicochemically characterized with Fourier Transform InfraRed (FTIR), X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), and Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (AAS). Balb-C mice (n = 45) were randomly divided into three groups: carbonated hydroxyapatite, CHA (n = 15), ACPMetals (n = 15), and without implantation of material (SHAM, n = 15). The groups were subdivided into three experimental periods (1, 3, and 9 weeks). The samples were processed histologically for descriptive and semiquantitative evaluation of the biological effect of biomaterials according to ISO 10993-6:2016. The ACPMetals group was partially biodegradable; however, it presented a severe irritating reaction after 1 and 3 weeks and moderately irritating after nine weeks. Future studies with other concentrations and other metals should be carried out to mimic biological apatite.},

ABSTRACT = {Extended bone fractures or fractures coexisting with bone disorders can lead to non-unions where surgical intervention is required. Composite drug delivery systems are being used increasingly more in order to treat such defects locally. Alendronate (ALD), a bisphosphonate extensively used in clinical practice to treat conditions, such as osteoporosis, has been shown to assist bone fracture healing through its antiresorptive capacity. This study reports the development of a polymeric composite system for the in situ delivery of ALD, which possesses enhanced encapsulation efficiency (EE%) and demonstrates controlled release over a 70-day period. ALD and calcium phosphate (CaP) were incorporated within poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) microspheres, giving rise to a 70% increase in EE% compared to a control system. Finally, a preliminary toxicological evaluation demonstrated a positive effect of the system on pre-osteoblastic cells over 72 h.},

ABSTRACT = {The ability to control the interactions between functional biomaterials and biological systems is of great importance for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. However, the underlying mechanisms defining the interplay between biomaterial properties and the human body are complex. Therefore, a key challenge is to design biomaterials that mimic the in vivo microenvironment. Over millions of years, nature has produced a wide variety of biological materials optimised for distinct functions, ranging from the extracellular matrix (ECM) for structural and biochemical support of cells to the holy lotus with special wettability for self-cleaning effects. Many of these systems found in biology possess unique surface properties recognised to regulate cell behaviour. Integration of such natural surface properties in biomaterials can bring about novel cell responses in vitro and provide greater insights into the processes occurring at the cell-biomaterial interface. Using natural surfaces as templates for bioinspired design can stimulate progress in the field of regenerative medicine, tissue engineering and biomaterials science. This literature review aims to combine the state-of-the-art knowledge in natural and nature-inspired surfaces, with an emphasis on material properties known to affect cell behaviour.},

ABSTRACT = {The ionic gelation technique allows us to obtain nanoparticles able to function as carriers for hydrophobic anticancer drugs, such as 5-fluoruracil (5-FU). In this study, reticulated chitosan– docosahexaenoic acid (Chi–DHAr) nanoparticles were synthesized by using a chemical reaction between amine groups of chitosan (Chi) and carboxylic acids of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and the presence of a link between Chi and DHA was confirmed by FT-IR, while the size and morphology of the obtained Chi-DHAr nanoparticles was evaluated with dynamic light scattering (DLS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), respectively. Drug-loading content (DLC) and drug-loading efficiency (DLE) of 5-FU in Chi-DHAr nanoparticles were 33.74 ± 0.19% and 7.9 ± 0.26%, respectively, while in the non-functionalized nanoparticles (Chir + 5FU), DLC, and DLE were in the ranges of 23.73 ± 0.14%, 5.62%, and 0.23%, respectively. The in vitro release profile, performed in phosphate buffer saline (PBS, pH 7.4) at 37 °C, indicated that the synthetized Chi–DHAr nanoparticles provided a sustained release of 5-FU. Based on the obtained regression coefficient value (R2), the first order kinetic model provided the best fit for both Chir and Chi-DHAr nanoparticles. Finally, cytotoxicity studies of chitosan, 5-FU, Chir, Chir + 5-FU, Chi-DHAr, and Chi-DHAr + 5-FU nanoparticles were conducted. Overall, Chi-DHAr nanoparticles proved to be much more biocompatible than Chir nanoparticles while retaining the ability to release the drug with high efficiency, especially towards specific types of cancerous cells.},

ABSTRACT = {Natural medicinal plants have attracted considerable research attention for their potential as effective drugs. The roots, leaves and stems of the plant, Dendropanax morbifera, which is endemic to southern regions of Asia, have long been used as a folk medicine to treat variety of diseases. However, the sap of this plant has not been widely studied and its bioactive properties have yet to be clearly elucidated. Here, we isolated extracellular vesicles from D. morbifera sap with the goal of improving the intracellular delivery efficiency and clinical effectiveness of bioactive compounds in D. morbifera sap. We further investigated the anti-metastatic effects of D. morbifera sap-derived extracellular vesicles (DMS-EVs) using a cancer metastasis model based on 3D microfluidic system that closely mimics the in vivo tumor environment. We found that DMS-EVs exerted a concentration-dependent suppressive effect on cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which are important mediators of cancer metastasis. DMS-EVs also altered expression level of genes, especially growth factor and extracellular matrix (ECM)-related genes, including integrin and collagen. Our findings suggest that DMS-EVs can act as anti-CAF agents to reduce CAFs in the tumor microenvironment. They further indicate the utility of our 3D microfluidic model for various drug-screening assays as a potential alternative to animal testing for use in validating therapeutic effects on cancer metastasis.},

ABSTRACT = {Background: This study compared the in vitro response of a mouse pre-osteoblast cell line on a novel sandblasted zirconia surface with that of titanium. Material and Methods: The MC3T3-E1 subclone 4 osteoblast precursor cell line was cultured on either sandblasted titanium (SBCpTi) or sandblasted zirconia (SBY-TZP). The surface topography was analysed by three-dimensional laser microscopy and scanning electron microscope. The wettability of the discs was also assessed. The cellular response was quantified by assessing the morphology (day 1), proliferation (day 1, 3, 5, 7, 9), viability (day 1, 9), and migration (0, 6, 24 h) assays. Results: The sandblasting surface treatment in both titanium and zirconia increased the surface roughness by rendering a defined surface topography with titanium showing more apparent nano-topography. The wettability of the two surfaces showed no significant difference. The zirconia surface resulted in improved cellular spreading and a significantly increased rate of migration compared to titanium. However, the cellular proliferation and viability noted in our experiments were not significantly different on the zirconia and titanium surfaces. Conclusions: The novel, roughened zirconia surface elicited cellular responses comparable to, or exceeding that, of titanium. Therefore, this novel zirconia surface may be an acceptable substitute for titanium as a dental implant material.},

ABSTRACT = {Background: The question of reconstruction of human tissues and organs with the use of medical materials is still open, because of the accurate requirements for their biological and physical features. The aim of this study was to prove the efficiency of titanium nickelide constructors in treatment of isolated orbital floor fractures or combination with zygomatico-orbital complex fractures. Methods: Patients with a fracture of zygomatico-orbital complex and/or low orbital floor (n = 44) carried out different treatments: in the first group, osteosynthesis and endoprosthesis with titanium nickelide structures; in the second group, titan mini-plates osteosynthesis; in the third group (‘blow-out’), endoprosthesis with a titanium nickelide mesh; and in the fourth group (‘blow-out’), conservative treatment and monitoring (archive data) (p > 0.05). The paraesthesia, diplopia, enophthalmos and exophthalmos degree were measured in points. Results: In one year, the first and second groups had no differences in level of paraesthesia (p > 0.05). The absence of exophthalmos and differences between first and second groups, and between the third and the fourth groups with positive dynamics inside the groups were proved (p < 0.05). In the first and third groups, enophthalmos was absent, and it increased in the second and fourth groups (p < 0.01, p < 0.11). Diplopia in the first and third groups was absent, and it increased in the second and fourth groups (p < 0.05, p < 0.01). Conclusion: The elasticity and biocompatibility of titanium nickelide make the implant insertion and restoration of the lower orbital wall anatomy easier, with good postoperative clinical results.},

ABSTRACT = {The study aim was to assess the effect of incorporating polylysine (PLS) filler at different mass fractions (0.5, 1 and 2 wt%) on PLS release and Streptococcus mutans planktonic growth. Composite containing PLS mass and volume change and PLS release upon water immersion were assessed gravimetrically and via high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), respectively. Disc effects on bacterial counts in broth initially containing 8 × 105 versus 8 × 106 CFU/mL Streptococcus mutans UA159 were determined after 24 h. Survival of sedimented bacteria after 72 h was determined following LIVE/DEAD staining of composite surfaces using confocal microscopy. Water sorption-induced mass change at two months increased from 0.7 to 1.7% with increasing PLS concentration. Average volume increases were 2.3% at two months whilst polylysine release levelled at 4% at 3 weeks irrespective of composite PLS level. Early percentage PLS release, however, was faster with higher composite content. With 0.5, 1 and 2% polylysine initially in the composite filler phase, 24-h PLS release into 1 mL of water yielded 8, 25 and 93 ppm respectively. With initial bacterial counts of 8 × 105 CFU/mL, this PLS release reduced 24-h bacterial counts from 109 down to 108, 107 and 102 CFU/mL respectively. With a high initial inoculum, 24-h bacterial counts were 109 with 0, 0.5 or 1% PLS and 107 with 2% PLS. As the PLS composite content was raised, the ratio of dead to live sedimented bacteria increased. The antibacterial action of the experimental composites could reduce residual bacteria remaining following minimally invasive tooth restorations.},
