ABSTRACT = {This paper proposes an indirect method to measure absolute acoustic nonlinearity parameters using surface acoustic waves by employing a fully non-contact laser-ultrasonic technique. For this purpose, the relationship between the ratio of relative acoustic nonlinearity parameters measured using the proposed method in two different materials (a test material and a reference material) and the ratio of absolute acoustic nonlinearity parameters in these two materials was theoretically derived. Using this relationship, when the absolute nonlinearity parameter of the reference material is known, the absolute nonlinearity parameter of the test material can be obtained using the ratio of the measured relative parameters of the two materials. For experimental verification, aluminum and copper specimens were used as reference and test materials, respectively. The relative acoustic nonlinearity parameters of the two materials were measured from surface waves generated and received using lasers. Additionally, the absolute parameters of aluminum and copper were measured using a conventional direct measurement method, with the former being used as a reference value and the latter being used for comparison with the estimation result. The absolute parameter of copper estimated by the proposed method showed good agreement with the directly measured result.},

ABSTRACT = {The present paper is focused on the post processing of the data coming from the Blade Tip-Timing (BTT) sensors in the case where two very close peaks are present in the frequency response of the vibrating system. This type of dynamic response with two very close peaks can occur quite often in bladed disks. It is related to the fact that the bladed disk is not perfectly cyclic symmetric and the so called “mistuning” is present. A method based on the fitting of the BTT sensors data by means of a 2 degrees of freedom (2DOF) dynamic model is proposed. Nonlinear least square optimization technique is employed for identification of the vibration characteristics. A numerical test case based on a lump parameter model of a bladed disk assembly is used to simulate different response curves and the corresponding sensors signals. The Frequency Response Function (FRF) constructed at the resonance region is compared with the traditional Sine fitting results, the resonance frequencies and damping values estimated by the fitting procedure are also reported. Accurate predictions are achieved and the results demonstrate the considerable capacity of the 2DOF method to be used as a standalone or as a complement to the standard Sine fitting method.},

ABSTRACT = {Thin-walled conical parts with variable-section are usually made of superalloy material, with poor plasticity and complex forces, which are difficult to form and control. In this research, a thin-walled conical casing of superalloy GH1140 with variable-section is studied; the real stress–strain curve of the material is fitted and the load-displacement curves of superalloy GH1140 are obtained through a universal testing machine. To clarify the equivalent stress distribution on the upper surface of the thin-walled casing during the forming process and after unloading the rotary wheel, the finite element model of the thin-walled conical casing during the spinning forming process is established with the Simufact Forming finite element analysis software. The effects of processing parameters, such as the mandrel rotational speed ω, the roller feed ratio f and the gap deviation rate δ between the roller and mandrel, on the spinning forming load were obtained. The distribution and numerical trend of the tangential residual stress after forming were detected by X-ray diffraction, and the causes of defects such as flange instability were analyzed. The results of the forming test and the test of residual stress conform well with the simulation, which verifies the stability of the model. The research provides a theoretical basis for improving the forming quality of thin-walled parts with variable-section.},

ABSTRACT = {In semiconductor wafer fabrication (wafer fab), wafers go through hundreds of process steps on a variety of processing machines for electrical circuit building operations. One of the special features in the wafer fabs is that there exist batch processors (BPs) where several wafer lots are processed at the same time as a batch. The batch processors have a significant influence on system performance because the repetitive batching and de-batching activities in a reentrant product flow system lead to non-smooth product flows with high variability. Existing research on the BP control problems has mostly focused on the local performance, such as waiting time at the BP stations. This paper attempts to examine how much BP control policies affect the system-wide behavior of the wafer fabs. A simulation model is constructed with which experiments are performed to analyze the performance of BP control rules under various production environments. Some meaningful insights on BP control decisions are identified through simulation results.},

ABSTRACT = {Temperature is an important factor that affects corrosion potential in rebars. The temperature effect must be removed from the corrosion potential for precise measurement of corrosion rates. To separate the temperature effect from the corrosion potential, in this study rebar specimens were not embedded in concrete but, instead, were placed in an uncontrolled air environment. Gaussian process regression (GPR) was applied to the temperature and the non-corrosion potential data in order to remove the temperature effect from the corrosion potential. The results indicated that the corrosion potential was affected by the temperature. Furthermore, the GPR models of all the experimental cases showed high coefficients of determination (R2 > 0.90) and low root mean square errors (RMSE < 0.08), meaning that these models had high reliability. The fitted GPR models were used to successfully remove the temperature effect from the corrosion potential. This demonstrates that the GPR method can be appropriately used to assess the temperature effect on rebar corrosion.},

ABSTRACT = {Design requirement is as important in aerodynamic design as in other industries because it sets up the objective for the samples in design space to approach. Natural Laminar Flow (NLF) optimization belongs to the type of aerodynamic design problems featured by the combination of distinct aerodynamic performance, where the design requirement is often formulated in form of summation of laminar-related performance and pressure drag performance with different weight assignment according to different perspectives. However, the formulations are rather experience-oriented and are decided non-quantitatively. Inspired by data manipulation approaches in design space (spanned by design variables of geometrical representation parameters) in many aerodynamic designs, this paper proposes new formulations of design requirement in NLF optimization via consideration of objective space (projection of design space through aerodynamics) and shows the impact of the corresponding formulation of design requirement to the result of NLF optimization in cases of transonic airfoil and aero engine compressor blade design from two perspectives: Pareto front convergence and improving effect of accessory performance. The paper uses Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to obtain the eigenvectors of objective space to extract the intrinsic information about specific problem. The method is realized in two cases with satisfactory result.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, a series of indentation tests in which the maximum normal force ranged from 0.4 to 3.3 N were carried out to determine the fracture toughness of 4H-SiC single crystals. The results indicated that an appropriate ratio of the distance from the indentation center to the radial crack tip to the distance from the indentation center to the indentation corner is significant to calculate fracture toughness of 4H-SiC single crystals. The critical condition with no cracks on the edge of the indentation was obtained through a fitting method. The surface morphologies of the groove were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Plastic deformation was observed and characterized by the smooth groove without cracks and ductile chips on the edge of the groove in the initial stages of scratch. With increased normal force, median cracks, radial cracks, and microcracks appeared in turn, followed by the crack system no longer being able to stably extend, causing the brittle fracture to dominate the material removal. The size of the edge damages were measured through SEM and the experimental data highly agreed with the predicted curve. A modified calculation model considering elastic recovery of the sample by the indenter during the scratching process was suggested. These results prove that elastic recovery of 4H-SiC single crystals cannot be ignored during ultra-precision machining.},

ABSTRACT = {Induction motors are mainstay power components in industrial equipment. Fault diagnosis technology of induction motors can detect the incipient fault and avoid the unplanned shutdown. The broken rotor bar is a significant fault mode of induction motors. Classical fault diagnosis methods always have complex principles and high computational costs, which leads to difficulties in understanding and calculation. In this paper, a method of broken rotor bar diagnosis based on the sum-of-squares of current signals is proposed. This method can eliminate the fundamental frequency and extract the signature frequency components by calculating the sum-of-squares of three-phase current signals. The signature frequency components are more apparent in the spectrum of the sum-of-squares of current signals. The effectiveness of the proposed method under different load levels and rotation motor speeds has been validated by two experiments. Compared with the classical diagnostic methods, the proposed method has better effectiveness and lower computation cost.},

ABSTRACT = {Using surface plasmon resonance imaging (SPRi), we have recently shown for the first time the existence of a monolayer water film between droplets during dropwise condensation. This study examines the effect of adsorbed volatile organic compounds (VOCs) on the ultrathin film measurement using SPRi. Further, the work presents the proper surface-treatment process that enables measurements of the ultrathin water layer during high-speed imaging of dropwise condensation at 3000 frame per second. In this study, two methods were applied for cleaning the surface (gold-coated glass)—(1) standard cleaning procedure (SCP) using acetone, isopropyl alcohol, and deionized water and (2) SCP followed by air plasma cleaning. This work discusses the effect of the cleaning procedures on surface roughness, contact angle, and surface chemistry using atomic force microscopy, optical microscopy, and an X-ray photoelectron spectroscope meter. The results showed that SCP before the SPRi is a proper surface-treatment method. The effect of adsorbed VOCs during dropwise condensation on a surface treated with SCP was measured to be 0.0025 (reflectivity unit), which was 70% smaller than the reflectance associated with a monolayer water film. The results of this work confirm a monolayer water film observation during the dropwise condensation, which has been reported before.},

ABSTRACT = {Dynamic response of a bridge–embankment transition is determined by, and therefore an indicator of, the coupled train–track–subgrade system. This study aims to investigate the approach of coupling the train–track–subgrade system to determine the dynamic response of the transition. The coupled system is established numerically based on the weak energy variation, the overall Lagrange format of D’Alembert’s principle and dynamics of the multi-rigid body, which is verified by in-site measurements. With this model, the influence of rail bending, differential settlement and other factors on the dynamic performance of the transition system is analyzed. The results show that when the train driving speed is 350 km/h, basic requirements should be satisfied. These requirements include that the irregularity bending of the bridge–embankment transition section should be less than 1/1000, the rigidity ratio should be controlled within 1:6, and the length of the transition section should be more than 25 m. In addition, the differential settlement should not exceed 5 mm. Among these factors, the differential settlement and the bending of the rail surface are the main ones to cause the severe dynamic irregularity of the transition section. Our analysis also indicates a requirement to strengthen the 18 m and 25–30 m distance from the abutment tail and the bed structure.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper shows the results of simulation of features and usability of a proposed method for particle matter (PM) separation detection based on composite electric field. Considering the composite electric field and drag coefficient, a nonlinear dynamic model of particle separation is established. Meanwhile, the model takes into account the changes in the dynamic model caused by the different diameters and different speeds of the particles, and uses the effect of the composite electric field to separate the PM. Numerical simulation results show that the PM diameter, electric field strength, and drag force have significant effects on the separation of particles. Among them, as the drag force decreases, the particle separation displacement gradually increases, and the electric field affects the particle separation direction. In the acceleration room, the particle velocity increases with the increasing of the electric field strength. In the separation room, the displacement of the particulate matter in the Y-axis direction gradually increases from a negative displacement to a positive displacement as the electric field strength increases. The displacement forms a bow shape. When the drag coefficient is changed, the displacement will suddenly increase while it is lower than a certain value. Considering the change of electric field and drag force at the same time, the separation effect would be more obvious when the drag coefficient is smaller. The electric field strength affects the separation direction of the particulate matter.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper presents the structural behaviors of reinforced concrete (RC) beams that have been strengthened with carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) sheets experimentally and numerically. Test specimens were subjected to four-point bending, and structural behavior was observed using a strain gauge and a Brillouin optical time domain reflectometer (BOTDR) sensor. Non-linear finite element analysis was conducted to examine the applicability and reliability of numerical models using the commercial finite element code, LS-DYNA. In the results, the de-bonded section between the beam substrate and CFRP sheet affected the initial crack in the structure, while the ultimate load, which is related to structural failure, was unaffected. The predicted results correlated well with the experimental observations in terms of the trend of the load-displacement curve, initial crack load, ultimate load and failure mode. Additionally, it is shown that the de-bonding behaviors in the interface were examined using the strain distributions for the CFRP sheets through the experiment and numerical simulations.},

ABSTRACT = {The ultra-wide band (UWB) technology has many advantages in positioning and measuring systems; however, powers of UWB signals rapidly reduce while traveling in propagation environments, hence detecting UWB signals are difficult. Various modulation techniques are applied for UWB signals to increase the ability for detecting the reflected signal from transmission mediums, such as pulse amplitude modulation (PAM), pulse position modulation (PPM), and so on. In this paper, we propose an ultra-wide band pulse position modulation technique with optimized additional time shift (UWB-PPM-ATS) to enhance the accuracy in locating buried object in nondestructive environments. Moreover, the Levenberg–Marquardt Fletcher algorithm (LMFA) is applied to determine the medium parameters and buried object location simultaneously. The influences of proposed modulation technique on determining system’s parameters, such as a propagation time, distance, and properties of the medium are analyzed. Calculation results indicate that the proposed UWB-PPM-ATS gives higher accuracy than the conventional one such as UWB-OOK and UWB-PPM in both homogeneous and heterogeneous environments. Furthermore, the LMFA with the proposed UWB-PPM-ATS outperforms the LMFA with the traditional modulation method, especially for unknown propagation environment.},

ABSTRACT = {Currently, the widely used pendulum-type precision level cannot be miniaturized because reducing the size of the pendulum will reduce its displacement so as to decrease the measurement accuracy and resolution. Moreover, the commercial pendulum-type level can only sense one direction. In this paper, an innovative compact and high-accuracy dual-axis precision level is proposed. Based on the optical principle of light refraction and the reference of the invariant liquid level, the pendulum is no more needed. In addition, based on the light transmission design, there is no reflection signal to interfere with the true signal. Therefore, the level can achieve a high accuracy and small-sized design. The calibration result shows the error of the proposed precision level is better than ±0.6 arc-sec in the measurement range of ±100 arc-sec, and better than ±5 arc-sec in the full measurement range of ±800 arc-sec.},

The following paper discusses basic physical prerequisites for assembling the systems that can sense loading states and monitor the operational safety conditions of pressure piping systems in the long-run. The appropriate monitoring system hardware with cost-effective data management was designed in order to enable the real-time monitoring of operational safety parameters.

ABSTRACT = {This paper proposes an energy-saving system based on a prefill system and a buffer system to improve the energy efficiency and the processing performance of hydraulic presses. Saving energy by integrating such systems into the cooling system of a hydraulic press has not been previously reported. A prefill system, powered by the power unit of the cooling system, is used to supply power simultaneously with the traditional power unit during the pressurization stage, thus reducing the usage of pumps and installed power of the hydraulic press. In contrast to the traditional prefill system, the proposed energy-saving system is controlled by a servo valve to adjust flow according to the load profile. In addition, a buffer system is employed to the cooling system to absorb the hydraulic shock generated at the unloading stage, store those shares of hydraulic energy as a recovery accumulator, and then release this energy to power the prefill system and the hydraulic actuator in the subsequent productive process. Finally, through a series of comparative experiments, it was preliminarily validated that the proposed system could reduce the installed power and pressure shock by up to 22.85% and 41%, respectively, increase energy efficiency by up to 26.71%, and provide the same processing characteristics and properties as the traditional hydraulic press.},

ABSTRACT = {Spider silk, as a natural material, shows exceptional performance in its properties. The combination of the superior properties of spider silk and the geometry of spider structures make the spider web very resilient. A spider web structure can be considered as a cable-like structure with inappreciable torsional, bending and shear rigidities. An investigation emphasising on natural frequencies and corresponding mode shapes with and without the consideration of geometric nonlinearity is presented in this paper. This study is the world’s first discovery of large amplitude free vibration behaviours of spider web structures. Large deformable finite element 3D models of spider web structures have been developed and validated. By using the energy method, the variational model of the spider web structures have been established to further extend the finite element model, consisting of the strain energy due to axial deformation, kinetic energy due to the spider web movement and the virtual work caused by the self-weight per unit unstretched length. The emphasis of this study is placed on the linear and geometric nonlinear behaviour of the spider web structures considering different structural patterns and material properties. To determine the large-amplitude free vibrational behaviours, a series of pretension load is applied to the first step in Abaqus to initiate the nonlinear strain-displacement relationships enabling a precursor to free vibrations. The parametric studies stemming from structural patterns (the number of radial and capture threads), elastic modulus, density, and inertia moment have been highlighted. The insight will help engineers and scientists to adapt the concept of spider webs, their geometric properties, and damage patterns for the design of any structural membranes, preventing any failure from dynamic resonances and nonlinear phenomena.},

ABSTRACT = {A planetary exploration rover’s ability to detect the type of supporting surface is critical to the successful accomplishment of the planned task, especially for long-range and long-duration missions. This paper presents a general approach to endow a robot with the ability to sense the terrain being traversed. It relies on the estimation of motion states and physical variables pertaining to the interaction of the vehicle with the environment. First, a comprehensive proprioceptive feature set is investigated to evaluate the informative content and the ability to gather terrain properties. Then, a terrain classifier is developed grounded on Support Vector Machine (SVM) and that uses an optimal proprioceptive feature set. Following this rationale, episodes of high slippage can be also treated as a particular terrain type and detected via a dedicated classifier. The proposed approach is tested and demonstrated in the field using SherpaTT rover, property of DFKI (German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence), that uses an active suspension system to adapt to terrain unevenness.},

ABSTRACT = {A homodyne interferometer is one of the most important tools in nanometre measurements. However, its nonlinear error seriously affects measurement accuracy at the sub-nanometre level. As one of the dominant factors that cause nonlinear error in a homodyne interferometer with a quadrature detector system, the imperfection of polarizing beam splitters (PBSs) is investigated in this paper. The nonlinear error caused by the imperfection of PBSs in the detection part can be reduced by adjusting the gains of detectors. Nevertheless, eliminating the nonlinear error caused by the polarization mixing of the PBS in the interferometer part is difficult. In this paper, the nonlinear error caused by the polarization mixing of the PBS in the interferometer part is analyzed, and an optical compensation method is proposed to correct this polarization mixing. Theoretical calculation and simulation analysis show that this method can reduce the effect of inherent polarization mixing on nonlinear error significantly. In comparison with using only gain adjustment, the nonlinear error can be reduced by two orders of magnitude when the proposed method is applied. The nonlinear error can be decreased from approximately 4.5 nm to approximately 0.045 nm using the presented method based on the simulation results.},

ABSTRACT = {This study focuses on the structural analysis of the front single-sided swingarm of a new three-wheel electric motorcycle, recently designed to meet the challenges of the vehicle electrification era. The primary target is to develop a swingarm capable of withstanding the forces applied during motorcycle’s operation and, at the same time, to be as lightweight as possible. Different scenarios of force loadings are considered and emphasis is given to braking forces in emergency braking conditions where higher loads are applied to the front wheels of the vehicle. A dedicated Computer Aided Engineering (CAE) software is used for the structural evaluation of different swingarm designs, through a series of finite element analysis simulations. A topology optimization procedure is also implemented to assist the redesign effort and reduce the weight of the final design. Simulation results in the worst-case loading conditions, indicate strongly that the proposed structure is effective and promising for actual prototyping. A direct comparison of results for the initial and final swingarm design revealed that a 23.2% weight reduction was achieved.},

ABSTRACT = {In recent years, the method of deep learning has been widely used in the field of fault diagnosis of mechanical equipment due to its strong feature extraction and other advantages such as high efficiency, portability, and so on. However, at present, most kinds of intelligent fault diagnosis algorithms mainly focus on the diagnosis of a single fault component, and few intelligent diagnosis models can simultaneously carry out comprehensive fault diagnosis for a rotating system composed of a shaft, bearing, gear, and so on. In order to solve this problem, a novel stacked auto encoders sparse filter rotating component comprehensive diagnosis network (SAFC) was proposed to extract domain invariant features of various health conditions at different speeds. The model clusters domain invariant features at different speeds through the self-coding network, and then classifies fault types of various parts through sparse filtering. The SAFC model was validated by the vibration data collected, and the results show that this model has higher diagnostic performance than other models.},

ABSTRACT = {Smart Spring is a kind of active vibration control device based on piezoelectric material, which can effectively suppress the vibration of the shaft system in an over-critical state, and the selection of control strategy has great influence on the vibration reduction effect of the Smart Spring. In this paper, the authors investigate the control of the over-critical vibration of the transmission shaft system with Smart Spring, based on the ADAMS and MATLAB joint simulation method. Firstly, the joint simulation model of three-support shafting with Smart Spring is established, and the over-critical speed simulation analysis of the three-support shafting under the fixed control force of the Smart Spring is carried out. The simulation results show that the maximum vibration reduction rate is 71.6%. The accuracy of the joint simulation model is verified by the experiment of the three-support shafting subcritical vibration control. On this basis, a function control force vibration control strategy with time-varying control force is proposed. By analyzing the axis orbit of the shafting, the optimal fixed control force at different speeds is obtained, the control force function is determined by polynomial fitting, and the shafting critical crossing simulation under the function control force is carried out. The simulation results show that the displacement response of the shafting under the function control force is less than that under the fixed control force in the whole speed range.},

ABSTRACT = {Microalgae has received overwhelming attention worldwide as a sustainable source for energy generation. However, the production of biofuel from microalgae biomass consists of several steps, of which lipid extraction is the most important one. Because of the nature of feedstock, extraction needs special attention. Three different methods were studied to extract algal oil from two different algae variant, Chlorella sp. and Spirulina sp. The highest percentage oil yield was obtained by ultrasonication (9.4% for Chlorella sp., 6.6% for Spirulina sp.) followed by the Soxhlet and solvent extraction processes. Ultrasonication and Soxhlet extraction processes were further optimized to maximize oil extraction as solvent extraction was not effective in extracting lipid. For ultrasonication, an amplitude of 90% recorded the highest percentage yield of oil for Spirulina sp. and a 70% amplitude recorded the highest percentage yield of oil for Chlorella sp. On the other hand, for Soxhlet extraction, a combination of chloroform, hexane, and methanol at a 1:1:1 ratio resulted in the highest yield of algal oil. Afterward, the crude algae oil from the ultrasonication process was transesterified for 5 h using an immobilized lipase (Novozyme 435) at 40 °C to convert triglycerides into fatty acid methyl ester and glycerol. Thus, ultrasonic-assisted lipid extraction was successful in producing biodiesel from both the species.},

ABSTRACT = {The literature reports benefits when the cork powder obtained from industrial by-products is used as the filler of composite laminates. For example, while the fatigue life is insensitive to the presence of cork in the resin, significant improvements are achieved in terms of to low-velocity impact strength. However, in terms of ballistic domain, the literature does not yet report any study about the effect of incorporating powdered cork into resins. Therefore, this study intended to analyse the ballistic behaviour and damage tolerance of Kevlar/epoxy reinforced composites with matrix filled by cork powder. For this purpose, high-velocity impacts were studied on plates of Kevlar bi-directional woven laminates with surfaces of 100 × 100 mm2. It was possible to conclude that the minimum velocity of perforation is 1.6% higher when the cork powder is added to the resin, but considering the dispersion, this small difference can be neglected. In terms of damage areas, they are slightly lower when cork dust is added, especially for velocities below the minimum perforation velocity. Finally, the residual bending strength shows that these composites are less sensitive to impact velocity than the samples with neat resin. In addition to these benefits, cork powder reduces the amount of resin in the composite, making it more environmentally friendly.},

ABSTRACT = {The all-electric subsea gate valve actuator is one of the critical components of the all-electric subsea production control system. To bridge the gap of the low-power holding mechanism in the all-electric subsea gate valve actuator of the subsea production system, minimize the power consumption and cable number for control and improve the open-position keeping performance of all-electric subsea gate valve actuator, this paper proposed a novel low-power holding mechanism for the all-electric subsea gate valve actuator which can be applied to all-electric subsea gate valve actuators with various valve sizes and process pressure ratings. The proposed low-power holding mechanism uses an electromagnet as a driving element, combines the spiral transmission and the cam-like transmission, and only requires a holding force of approximately 2–7% of the maximum load of the closing spring to keep the valve open. The proposed low-power holding mechanism converts the axial force of the closing spring into the circumferential force, which substantially reduces the output force required for the driving element of the low-power holding mechanism and the number of the actuator’s control cables. Analytic models are created for the lockable maximum load of the closing spring and the permissible stroke of the locking tab with regard to the design variables. The parameter effects and the corresponding sensitivities are discussed by numerical analysis. The design parameters and the lockable maximum load of the closing spring of the low-power holding mechanism are obtained.},

ABSTRACT = {Production scheduling is attracting considerable scientific interest. Effective scheduling of production jobs is a critical element of smooth organization of the work in an enterprise and, therefore, a key issue in production. The investigations focus on improving job scheduling effectiveness and methodology. Due to simplifying assumptions, most of the current solutions are not fit for industrial applications. Disruptions are inherent elements of the production process and yet, for reasons of simplicity, they tend to be rarely considered in the current scheduling models. This work presents the framework of a predictive job scheduling technique for application in the job-shop environment under the machine failure constraint. The prediction methods implemented in our work examine the nature of the machine failure uncertainty factor. The first section of this paper presents robust scheduling of production processes and reviews current solutions in the field of technological machine failure analysis. Next, elements of the Markov processes theory and ARIMA (auto-regressive integrated moving average) models are introduced to describe the parameters of machine failures. The effectiveness of our solutions is verified against real production data. The data derived from the strategic machine failure prediction model, employed at the preliminary stage, serve to develop the robust schedules using selected dispatching rules. The key stage of the verification process concerns the simulation testing that allows us to assess the execution of the production schedules obtained from the proposed model.},

ABSTRACT = {For a long time, cracked structures have triggered various researchers to develop a structural integrity approach and design models to address the fracture problems. In the present study, a pipeline with an axial semi-elliptical surface defect was examined in detail. Recent works have highlighted the use of the classical finite element method (CFEM) as numerical tools to solve the fracture mechanics; however, this approach comes with a few difficulties in the modelling aspects. To overcome this issue, we proposed the use of the extended finite element method (XFEM), which was implemented in the commercial version of Abaqus software. Moreover, we have used the results based on this technique in the volumetric method to estimate the stress intensity factors (SIFs). Then, this parameter was employed to build the failure assessment diagram (FAD). The FAD curve was used in the current investigation because it is one of the conventional methods for the evaluation of flaws in steel pipes. The XFEM simulations enable us to draw an FAD curve that can be used as a practical reference for defect evaluation in pipeline systems in the industrial world.},

ABSTRACT = {Components of transport trucks are subjected to dynamic cyclic loads. The magnitude of these loads depends on road conditions and cargo mass. Cyclic loads can cause fatigue failure at stress levels significantly below the yield strength of the material. When calculating fatigue, it is necessary to determine the actual loads acting on the structure under working conditions. In this study, stanchion displacements of overloaded timber trucks were measured under both static and dynamic loads. For the specified mass of timber, a history of dynamic loads acting on the stanchion was obtained. Then, based on the finite element analysis, stress concentration points were determined within the base material and welded joints of the stanchion. The history of maximum stresses at concentration points was determined. Stress ranges and mean stresses for the load history were calculated using the rainflow fatigue cycle counting method. Repeats to failure were determined on the basis of the Palmgren–Miner cumulative damage rule and the modified Goodman correction for the points with the highest stress level. Experimental investigation of the actual load history of the stanchion of significantly overloaded timber truck allowed to determine the mileage to potential failure.},

ABSTRACT = {The efficacy of Lokomat on motor recovery in stroke patients is well known. However, few studies have examined Lokomat tools to assess stiffness, joint torque and range of motion (ROM) during the subacute phase of stroke. The purpose of this retrospective observational study is to assess the changes of joint torque, ROM and stiffness that were estimated with Lokomat tools, namely L-FORCE (lower limb-force), L-ROM (lower limb-range of motion)and L-STIFF (lower limb-stiff), for paretic and non-paretic lower limbs in the subacute phase of stroke, assuming that the tools were able to measure these changes. The data come from 10 subjects in the subacute phase who had their first ever-stroke and followed a treatment that included Lokomat. The measurements came from basal assessments (T0) and one-month follow-up (T1). The measures were compared between paretic and non-paretic legs, and between T0 and T1. Significant differences in stiffness, joint torque and ROM were obtained between the paretic and non-paretic limbs at both T0 and T1. A non-significant trend was obtained for reduced stiffness and increased torque and ROM between T0 and T1 of the paretic limbs. The Lokomat tools were able to measure the changes between paretic and non-paretic legs and the small changes between T0 and T1 measurements.},

The impedance bond condition is monitored in real-time using current and temperature sensors, providing early warning if predefined thresholds are exceeded in terms of currents, imbalance currents, and temperatures. The proposed method and the developed monitoring device have been validated in the railway laboratory to confirm its capability to detect defects.

ABSTRACT = {Almost one-third of the revenues of the Additive Manufacturing (AM) machines market is generated by desktop systems. A new category of such devices are Laser Sintering (LS) machines, in which we can find a few representatives of this group. A growing interest in the use of desktop AM solutions in research and industry is visible, and therefore an evaluation of its capabilities and limitations is desirable. The presented paper focuses on comparing desktop (Sintratec S1; Sinterit Lisa) and industrial (Formiga P110) LS systems. The properties of raw materials were characterized by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), as well as by determining the Particle Size Distribution (PSD) and static and dynamic flowability of powder. Laser Sintering commercial sets were characterized by their mechanical properties (tensile strength), surface quality (roughness), as well as by their accuracy and porosity (computed tomography). The conducted test showed significant differences, especially in the case of material properties and manufacturing repeatability. The found differences between desktop and industrial LS systems suggest that the use of a low-budget LS system, especially for the research and production of end-use parts, has to take into account its limitations.},

ABSTRACT = {Carbide-free bainitic steels are an example of high-strength steels that show an excellent combination of strength, ductility, toughness and rolling fatigue contact resistance and are progressively being introduced in the production of railways, crossings and automotive components. Although there are Mn-free approaches able to produce carbide-free bainitic steels, those based on the addition of Mn are less expensive. Therefore, it is important to fully understand the mechanical behavior of such materials to develop reliable engineering products. In this paper, three low-carbon bainitic steels, differing in Mn content, namely 0%, 2.3% and 3.2%, designated as steel A, B and C, respectively, were studied in a systematic manner. Low-cycle fatigue tests were conducted under symmetrical strain-controlled conditions for different strain amplitudes (0.6%, 0.7%, 0.8% and 1%). Independent of Mn content, a strong relationship between cumulative strain energy density and number of cycles to failure was found. Based on this relationship, a new predictive model, capable of estimating the fatigue lifetime, was developed. Predictions based on the new model were close to the experimental lives and were more accurate than those computed via the well-known Smith-Watson-Topper (SWT) and Liu criteria.},

ABSTRACT = {In order to improve fuel economy, the number of gears in the hydraulic automatic transmission of heavy-duty mining trucks is continuously increasing. Compared with single-transition shifts, double-transition shifts can optimize the structure of multi-speed transmissions, but the difficulty of control will also increase. In this paper, a dynamic model of a 6 + 2 speed automatic transmission and vehicle powertrain system are built based on the Lagrange method, and the dynamic analysis of the two sets of clutches that make up the double-transition shift are carried out. Since a simulation model of the double-transition shift process is built-in MATLAB/Simulink, the shift jerk and clutch energy loss are used as multi-objective, and the genetic algorithm is used to optimize the simulation. Five strategies for the overlapping time of the clutches are proposed, and simulation experiments and Pareto optimal analysis are carried out, respectively. The simulation results show that the non-overlapping of the two sets of clutch inertia phases in the double-transition shift can effectively reduce the shift jerk. The overlapping of the torque phase and the inertia phase of the other clutch set can control the clutch energy loss at a low level due to using less shift time.},

ABSTRACT = {For the single crystal furnace used in the photovoltaic industry, growth problems occur frequently due to dislocations during the shouldering and cylindrical growth steps of the Czochralski (CZ) crystal growth. Detecting the dislocation phenomenon in the cylindrical growth step is very important for entire automation of the CZ crystal furnace, since this process usually lasts for more than 48h. The irregular nature of different patterns of dislocation would impose a big challenge for a traditional machine vision-based detection method. As almost no publications have been dedicated to detecting this phenomenon, to address this issue, after analyzing the characteristics of the silicon ingot image of this process, this paper proposes a kind of deep learning-based dislocation detection method along with tracking strategy to simulate manual inspection. The model has a good detection effect whether there is occlusion or not, the experimental results show that the detection accuracy is 97.33%, and the inference speed is about 14.7 frames per second (FPS). It can achieve the purpose of reducing energy consumption and improving process automation by monitoring this process.},

ABSTRACT = {Inaccurate state-of-health (SoH) estimation of battery can lead to over-discharge as the actual depth of discharge will be deeper, or a more-than-necessary number of charges as the calculated SoC will be underestimated, depending on whether the inaccuracy in the maximum stored charge is over or under estimated. Both can lead to increased degradation of a battery. Inaccurate SoH can also lead to the continuous use of battery below 80% actual SoH that could lead to catastrophic failures. Therefore, an accurate and rapid on-line SoH estimation method for lithium ion batteries, under different operating conditions such as varying ambient temperatures and discharge rates, is important. This work develops a method for this purpose, and the method combines the electrochemistry-based electrical model and semi-empirical capacity fading model on a discharge curve of a lithium-ion battery for the estimation of its maximum stored charge capacity, and thus its state of health. The method developed produces a close form that relates SoH with the number of charge-discharge cycles as well as operating temperatures and currents, and its inverse application allows us to estimate the remaining useful life of lithium ion batteries (LiB) for a given SoH threshold level. The estimation time is less than 5 s as the combined model is a closed-form model, and hence it is suitable for real time and on-line applications.},

ABSTRACT = {Using interlayers of rubber adds a positive effect to the synergy of disruptor–absorber armors. Emerging from its viscoelasticity the material is able to transform mechanical stress into heat. The dynamic mechanical properties of elastomers depend on both ambient temperature and frequency of an applied mechanical load. The damping shows a maximum in the glass transition area. If the frequency of the glass transition is in the magnitude of the mechanical stress rate applied by ballistic impact, the elastomer will undergo the transition and thus show maximized damping. An ideal material for ballistic protection against small calibers is developed by making use of dynamic mechanical analysis and the time–temperature superposition principle. The material is later analyzed by ballistic experiments and compared to other nonideal rubbers with regard to glass transition temperature, hardness and damping. It is shown that by choosing a material correctly with certain glass transition temperature and hardness, the ballistic properties of a steel–rubber–aluminum armor can be enhanced. The chosen material (butyl rubber) with a hardness of 50 °ShA is able to enhance energy absorption during ballistic impact by around 8%, which is twice as good as other rubber with non-optimized properties.},

ABSTRACT = {The development of additive manufacturing allows the transformation of technological processes and the redesign of products. Among the most used methods to support additive manufacturing, the design can be optimised through the integration of topology optimisation techniques, allowing for creating complex shapes. However, there are critical issues (i.e., definition of product and process parameters, selection of redesign variants, optimised designs interpretation, file exchange and data management, etc.) in identifying the most appropriate process and set-ups, as well as in selecting the best variant on a functional and morphological level. Therefore, to fully exploit the technological potentials and overcome the drawbacks, this paper proposes a systematic redesign approach based on additive manufacturing technologies that integrate topology optimisation and a tool for selecting design variants based on the optimisation of both product and process features. The method leads to the objective selection of the best redesigned configuration in accordance with the key performance indicators (KPIs) (i.e., functional and production requirements). As a case study, the redesign of a medical assistive device is proposed, previously developed in fused filament fabrication and now optimised for being 3D printed with selective laser melting.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper presents the design, simulation and experimental verification of adaptive feedforward motion control for a hydraulic differential cylinder. The proposed solution is implemented on a hydraulic loader crane. Based on common adaptation methods, a typical electro-hydraulic motion control system has been extended with a novel adaptive feedforward controller that has two separate feedforward states, i.e, one for each direction of motion. Simulations show convergence of the feedforward states, as well as 23% reduction in root mean square (RMS) cylinder position error compared to a fixed gain feedforward controller. The experiments show an even more pronounced advantage of the proposed controller, with an 80% reduction in RMS cylinder position error, and that the separate feedforward states are able to adapt to model uncertainties in both directions of motion.},

ABSTRACT = {Regarding the case of complicated structural shape optimization, there are cases where there are partial shapes such as holes and irregularities inside the structure. Concerning the complex structural optimization shape, the relationship between the external boundary shape and the internal local shape should be maintained, and how to change the internal partial shape while maintaining a subordinate relationship with the external form has become an important issue. Currently, there is no good solution to this kind of problem using general optimization design software. Therefore, this paper proposes to use the basic vector method to solve the local shape dependency problem of partial shapes. First, this paper classifies the subordinate problems of partial shape into three primary patterns, theoretically proving a method for controlling subordinate relationships of partial forms, respectively. Then, the research also provides two classical application examples: shape optimization of a steam turbine implantation section and stress distribution optimization of an engine mount bracket. The results show that the optimization method is effective for the partial shape subordination problem in complex structural shape optimization problems. Finally, the study examines the problem of making a vectorial vector, a correlation between the basis vector and the remeshing problem of the analysis model in shape optimization, and further substantiates the validity of the method proposed by the body using the analysis result of the actual structural shape optimization case.},

ABSTRACT = {Varying compliance (VC) is an unavoidable form of parametric excitation in rolling bearings and can affect the stability and safety of the bearing and its supporting rotor system. To date, we have investigated VC primary resonance in ball bearings, and in this paper other parametric VC resonance types are addressed. For a classical ball bearing model with Hertzian contact and clearance nonlinearities between the rolling elements and raceway, the harmonic balance and alternating frequency/time domain (HB–AFT) method and Floquet theory are adopted to analyze the VC parametric resonances and their stabilities. It is found that the 1/2-order subharmonic resonances, 2-order superharmonic resonances, and various VC combination resonances, such as the 1-order and 2-order summed types, can be excited, thus resulting in period-1, period-2, period-4, period-8, period-35, quasi-period, and even chaotic VC motions in the system. Furthermore, the bifurcation and hysteresis characteristics of complex VC resonant responses are discussed, in which cyclic fold, period doubling, and the second Hopf bifurcation can occur. Finally, the global involution of VC resonances around bearing clearance-free operations (i.e., adjusting the bearing clearance to zero or one with low interference) are provided. The overall results extend the investigation of VC parametric resonance cases in rolling bearings.},

The increasingly widespread use of batteries from mass production facilities highlights the need for a rapid and sensitive diagnostic tool for identifying battery defects. We demonstrate the use of atomic magnetometry to measure the magnetic fields around miniature solid-state battery cells. These fields encode information about battery manufacturing defects, state of charge, and impurities, and they can provide important insights into battery aging processes. Compared with SQUID-based magnetometry, the availability of atomic magnetometers, however, highlights the possibility of constructing a low-cost, portable, and flexible implementation of battery quality control and characterization technology.},

ABSTRACT = {In this work, a new method for solving a delay differential equation (DDE) with multiple delays is presented by using second- and third-order polynomials to approximate the delayed terms using the enhanced homotopy perturbation method (EMHPM). To study the proposed method performance in terms of convergency and computational cost in comparison with the first-order EMHPM, semi-discretization and full-discretization methods, a delay differential equation that model the cutting milling operation process was used. To further assess the accuracy of the proposed method, a milling process with a multivariable cutter is examined in order to find the stability boundaries. Then, theoretical predictions are computed from the corresponding DDE finding uncharted stable zones at high axial depths of cut. Time-domain simulations based on continuous wavelet transform (CWT) scalograms, power spectral density (PSD) charts and Poincaré maps (PM) were employed to validate the stability lobes found by using the third-order EMHPM for the multivariable tool.},

In addition, the DNN-based only line-of-sight (LOS) rate input guidance (DNNLG) law, in which only the LOS rate is an input variable, is introduced and compared with the PN and DNNG laws. Then, the DNNG and DNNLG laws examine behavior in an initial position other than the training data.},

ABSTRACT = {The dynamics of mesh reflectors are characterized by large deformation when antennas undergo a large motion in the deployment process. In this work, absolute node coordinate formulation (ANCF), with the merit of precise description of large deformation, is employed to consider the flexibility of the reflector net. From a practical perspective, the effect of the torsional spring is incorporated into the dynamic governing equations by an equivalent mechanical model. Deployment simulation of the mesh reflector antennas is performed by a numerical procedure. It can be found that with the action of a degenerative driven force caused by the friction effect, the deployed process of antennas exhibits a character of asynchronous deployment. Additionally, a significant increase in tension during the final period of deployment has an intense influence on smooth deployment.},

ABSTRACT = {In this work, experimental and numerical investigation on the deployment of solar panels with tape spring (TS) hinges showing complex nonlinear hysteresis behavior caused by the snap-through buckling was conducted. Subsequently, it was verified by comparing simulation results by multi-body dynamics (MBD) analysis with test results on ground-based deployment testing considering gravity compensation, termed zero-gravity (Zero-G) device. It has been difficult to predict the folding and unfolding behavior of TS hinges because their moment–rotation relationship showed a nonlinear hysteresis behavior. To realize this attribute, an algorithm that checks the sign of angular velocity of the revolute joints was used to distinguish folding from unfolding. The nonlinear hysteresis was implemented in terms of two path-dependent nonlinear moment–rotation curves with the aid of the expression function (a kind of user subroutine) in MBD software RecurDyn. Finally, it was found that the results of the deployment analysis were in excellent agreement with those of the test when the friction torques of the revolute joints were properly identified by an inverse analysis with the test frames, thus validating the MBD model.},

ABSTRACT = {The increase in the performance and effectiveness of maintenance processes is a continuous aim of production enterprises. The elimination of unexpected failures, which generate excessive costs and production losses, is emphasized. The elements that influence the efficiency of maintenance are not only the choice of an appropriate conservation strategy but also the use of appropriate methods and tools to support the decision-making process in this area. The research problem, which was considered in the paper, is an insufficient means of assessing the degree of the implementation of lean maintenance. This problem results in not only the possibility of achieving high efficiency of the exploited machines, but, foremost, it influences a decision process and the formulation of maintenance policy of an enterprise. The purpose of this paper is to present the possibility of using intelligent systems to support decision-making processes in the implementation of the lean maintenance concept, which allows the increase in the operational efficiency of the company’s technical infrastructure. In particular, artificial intelligence methods were used to search for relationships between specific activities carried out under the implementation of lean maintenance and the results obtained. Decision trees and rough set theory were used for the analysis. The decision trees were made for the average value of the overall equipment effectiveness (OEE) indicator. The rough set theory was used to assess the degree of utilization of the lean maintenance strategy. Decision rules were generated based on the proposed algorithms, using RSES software, and their correctness was assessed.},

ABSTRACT = {In order to maximize inventory benefits or minimize costs, reliability and cost of inventory control models need to be identified and analyzed. These importance measures are one important approach to recognize and evaluate system weaknesses. However, importance measures have fewer applications in inventory systems’ reliability. Considering the cost, this paper mainly discusses the reliability change of performance parameters with the importance measures in inventory systems. The calculation methods of differential importance and Birnbaum importance are studied in the inventory control model with shortages. By comparing the importance values of various parameters in the model, the optimization analysis of the inventory model can be used to identify the key parameters, so as to effectively reduce the total inventory cost. The importance order and the identification of key parameters are helpful to increase the operational efficiency of the inventory control and provide effective methods for improving the inventory management. Lastly, a case study with a shortage and limited inventory capacity is used to demonstrate the proposed model.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper investigates the impact of thermal management methods on the design point and synthesis exchange rates of an ultra-high bypass ratio geared turbofan engine. In a typical thermal management system, where heat is managed by means of heat exchangers that transfer engine waste heat into oil, air, or fuel. However, the utilization of air–oil and fuel–oil heat exchangers has an adverse impact on engine performance. This paper investigates the impact on and engine’s specific fuel consumption and summarizes it into common exchange rates for different thermal management configurations. The results show that any pressure loss in the bypass duct results in a severe specific fuel consumption penalty (an increase of 1% pressure loss in the bypass duct causes a 2% specific fuel consumption increase at cruise conditions). In addition, quite severe is the impact of extracting air from the gas path, particularly when the bleed location is in the bypass duct or the high-pressure compressor. It is also found that the utilization of a fuel–oil heat exchanger improves the specific fuel consumption at a higher rate than an air–oil heat exchanger. For the performance characteristics of the examined engine, the specific fuel consumption benefit with the former is 1.33%, while for the latter it is 0.38%.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper emphasizes the importance of the influences of local dynamics on the global dynamics of a control system. By considering an actuator as an individual, nonlinear subsystem connected with a nonlinear process subsystem in cascade, a structure of interconnected nonlinear systems is proposed which allows for global and local supervision properties of the interconnected systems. To achieve this purpose, a kind of interconnected observer design method is investigated, and the convergence is studied. One major difficulty is that a state observation can only rely on the global system output at the terminal boundary. This is because the connection point between the two subsystems is considered unable to be measured, due to physical or economic reasons. Therefore, the aim of the interconnected observer is to estimate the state vector of each subsystem and the unmeasurable connection point. Specifically, the output used in the observer of the actuator subsystem is replaced by the estimation of the process subsystem observer, while the estimation of this interconnection is treated like an additional state in the observer design of the process subsystem. Expression for this new state is achieved by calculating the derivatives of the output equation of the actuator subsystem. Numerical simulations confirm the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed observer, which highlight the significance of the work compared with state-of-the-art methods.},

ABSTRACT = {Closed-loop control is desirable in direct energy deposition (DED) to stabilize the process and improve the fabrication quality. Most existing DED controllers require system identifications by experiments to obtain plant models or layer-dependent adaptive control rules, and such processes are cumbersome and time-consuming. This paper proposes a novel data-driven adaptive control strategy to adjust laser voltage with the melt pool size feedback. A multitasking controller architecture is developed to incorporate an autotuning unit that optimizes controller parameters based on the DED process data automatically. Experimental validations show improvements in the geometric accuracy and melt pool consistency of controlled samples. The main advantage of the proposed controller is that it can adapt to DED processes with different part shapes, materials, tool paths, and process parameters without tweaking. System identification is not required even when process conditions are changed, which reduces the controller implementation time and cost for end-users.},

We made the first in-vitro experimental attempt to measure the oscillatory flow velocity in a computed tomography (CT) scanned extra-thoracic airway (ETA) model with OSAHS by using the particle image velocimetry (PIV) technique. In order to mimic respiration flow, three techniques were adopted to address difficulties in in-vitro experimental modeling: (1) fabricating the obstructive ETA measurement section with the CT-scanned data of an OSAHS patient airway; (2) maintaining the measurement accuracy by using the optical index-matching technique; (3) reproducing the oscillatory respiratory flow rates with the compiled clinical data of transient tidal volumes. The in-vitro measurements of oscillatory respiratory flow velocity manifested the time evolution of the complex OSAHS flow patterns, and the potential wall collapse of the ETA model with OSAHS.},

ABSTRACT = {Lateral movement from the principal trajectory, or “swing”, can be generated on a cricket ball when its seam, which sits proud of the surface, is angled to the flow. The boundary layer on the two hemispheres divided by the seam is governed by the Reynolds number and the surface roughness; the swing is fundamentally caused by the pressure differences associated with asymmetric flow separation. Skillful bowlers impart a small backspin to create gyroscopic inertia and stabilize the seam position in flight. Under certain flow conditions, the resultant pressure asymmetry can reverse across the hemispheres and “reverse swing” will occur. In this paper, particle image velocimetry measurements of a scaled cricket ball are presented to interrogate the flow field and the physical mechanism for reverse swing. The results show that a laminar separation bubble forms on the non-seam side (hemisphere), causing the separation angle for the boundary layer to be increased relative to that on the seam side. For the first time, it is shown that the separation bubble is present even under large rates of backspin, suggesting that this flow feature is present under match conditions. The Magnus effect on a rotating ball is also demonstrated, with the position of flow separation on the upper (retreating) side delayed due to the reduced relative speed between the surface and the freestream.},

ABSTRACT = {The theoretical research on means to reduce the vertical vibrations and improve the ride comfort of the railway vehicle relies on a mechanical model obtained from the simplified representation of the vehicle, while considering the important factors and elements affecting the vibration behaviour of the carbody. One of these elements is the anti-yaw damper, mounted longitudinally, between the bogie and the vehicle carbody. The anti-yaw damper reduces the lateral vibrations and inhibits the yaw motion of the vehicle, a reason for which this element is not usually introduced in the vehicle model when studying the vertical vibrations. Nevertheless, due to the position of the clamping points of the anti-yaw damper onto the carbody and the bogie, the damping force is generated not only in the yawing direction but also in the vertical and longitudinal directions. These forces act upon the vehicle carbody, impacting its vertical vibration behaviour. The paper analyzes the effect of the anti-winding damper on the vertical vibrations of the railway vehicle carbody and the ride comfort, based on the results derived from the numerical simulations. They highlight the influence of the damping, stiffness and the damper mounting angle on the power spectral density of the carbody vertical acceleration and the ride comfort index.},

ABSTRACT = {Fused deposition modeling (FDM) is one of the most common additive manufacturing (AM) technologies for thermoplastic materials. With the development of carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) filament for FDM, AM parts with improved strength and functionality can be realized. CFRP is anisotropic material and its mechanical properties have been well studied, however, AM printing strategy for CFRP parts has not been developed. This paper proposes a systematic optimization of the FDM 3D printing process for CFRP. Starting with standard coupon specimen tests to obtain mechanical properties of CFRP, finite element analyses (FEA) were conducted to find principal directions of the AM part and utilized to determine fiber orientations. A specific tool-path algorithm has been developed to distribute fibers with the desired orientations. To predict/assess the mechanical behavior of the AM part, the 3D printing process was simulated to obtain the anisotropic mechanical behavior induced by the customized tool-path printing. Bolt hole plate and spur gear were selected as case studies. FE simulations and associated experiments were conducted to assess their performance. CFRP parts printed by the optimized tool-path shows about 8% higher stiffness than those printed at regular infill patterns. In summary, assisted by FEA, a customized 3D printing tool-path for CFRP has been developed with case studies to verify the proposed AM design optimization methodology for FDM.},

ABSTRACT = {High reliability is the basic requirement of aerospace pyrotechnic devices. Traditional reliability evaluation methods require a lot of tests, which become too expensive; therefore, the small-sample evaluation method is needed to reduce the cost. Using energy as a performance parameter can better reflect the essence of the function of the pyrotechnic device compared to using force. Firstly, this article assumes that the strength obeys the normal distribution, and the stress is a constant; therefore, the reliability evaluation formula based on the t distribution is proposed. Then, taking the pin puller as the research object, four sets of energy measuring devices were developed so as to obtain its performance parameters. Finally, the evaluation results show that the pin puller has a high reliability of 0.9999999765 with a confidence level of 0.995. The reliability method proposed in this paper is a small-sample method for evaluating aerospace pyrotechnic devices, which can greatly reduce the cost of reliability evaluation. Moreover, the energy measuring devices developed in this paper can provide a new way of measuring performance parameters for piston-type pyrotechnic devices.},

ABSTRACT = {An alternative method is devised for calculating dynamic stability maps in cylindrical and centerless infeed grinding processes. The method is based on the application of the Floquet theorem by repeated time integrations. Without the need of building the transition matrix, this is the most efficient calculation in terms of computation effort compared to previously presented time-domain stability analysis methods (semi-discretization or time-domain simulations). In the analyzed cases, subspace iteration has been up to 130 times faster. One of the advantages of these time-domain methods to the detriment of frequency domain ones is that they can analyze the stability of regenerative chatter with the application of variable workpiece speed, a well-known technique to avoid chatter vibrations in grinding processes so the optimal combination of amplitude and frequency can be selected. Subspace iteration methods also deal with this analysis, providing an efficient solution between 27 and 47 times faster than the abovementioned methods. Validation of this method has been carried out by comparing its accuracy with previous published methods such as semi-discretization, frequency and time-domain simulations, obtaining good correlation in the results of the dynamic stability maps and the instability reduction ratio maps due to the application of variable speed.},

ABSTRACT = {Power transformers are considered to be the most important assets in power substations. Thus, their maintenance is important to ensure the reliability of the power transmission and distribution system. One of the most commonly used methods for managing the maintenance and establishing the health status of power transformers is dissolved gas analysis (DGA). The presence of acetylene in the DGA results may indicate arcing or high-temperature thermal faults in the transformer. In old transformers with an on-load tap-changer (OLTC), oil or gases can be filtered from the OLTC compartment to the transformer’s main tank. This paper presents a method for determining the transformer oil contamination from the OLTC gases in a group of power transformers for a distribution system operator (DSO) based on the application of the guides and the knowledge of experts. As a result, twenty-six out of the 175 transformers studied are defined as contaminated from the OLTC gases. In addition, this paper presents a methodology based on machine learning techniques that allows the system to determine the transformer oil contamination from the DGA results. The trained model achieves an accuracy of 99.76% in identifying oil contamination.},

ABSTRACT = {Ceramic-on-ceramic bearings for total hip replacement are considered the best choice to avoid problems such as osteolysis and wear, mainly related to soft bearings. The aim of this work was to investigate in a comparative way different kinds of ceramic femoral heads for total hip replacements from a biotribological point of view, discussing the results obtained in terms of topographies, presence of metal transfer (MT) phenomena, and wettability on their worn surfaces in a tribological framework. Different ceramic femoral heads derived from in vitro wear tests, retrieved form patients, and brand new total hip replacements were investigated. The patients group had an average age of 60 years (ranging from 27 to 83). In most cases, the cause of failure was aseptic loosening of the acetabular component. Roughness analyses were performed to measure the tribological surface evolution of the material; an SEM and EDS investigation on the explanted heads proves and quantified MT, while the wettability was measured through a novel optical laboratory set-up with the aim to furnish useful data in the framework of synovial lubrication phenomena acting in the tribosystem. For the average roughness measurements on explanted specimens were considered three parameters (Ra = the average area between the roughness profile and its mean line; Rt = the vertical distance from the deepest valley to the highest peak of the roughness profile; and Rsk = it is the skewness and it is a measure of the asymmetry of the amplitude distribution function. In other words, the skewness indicates whether a surface is dominated by peaks or by valleys) and their values were: Ra 0.22 ± 0.12 μm, Rt 34.5 ± 13.5 μm and Rsk −0.01 ± 11.3; on the new specimens we measured Ra 0.01 ± 0.001 μm, Rt 0.12 ± 0.09 μm, and Rsk = 5.67 ± 8.7; for the in vitro specimens they were Ra 0.05 ± 0.12 μm, Rt 0.71 ± 1.4 μm and Rsk 7.73 ± 20.6. The wettability angle measurements showed hydrophilic surfaces for all femoral heads considered in this study with small differences between the three investigated categories, allowing to discuss their effects on the biobearings’ lubrication phenomena.},

ABSTRACT = {Estimating the remaining useful life (RUL) of components is a crucial task to enhance reliability, safety, productivity, and to reduce maintenance cost. In general, predicting the RUL of a component includes constructing a health indicator (HI) to infer the current condition of the component, and modelling the degradation process in order to estimate the future behavior. Although many signal processing and data-driven methods have been proposed to construct the HI, most of the existing methods are based on manual feature extraction techniques and require the prior knowledge of experts, or rely on a large amount of failure data. Therefore, in this study, a new data-driven method based on the convolutional autoencoder (CAE) is presented to construct the HI. For this purpose, the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) technique was used to convert the raw acquired vibrational signals into a two-dimensional image; then, the CAE model was trained by the healthy operation dataset. Finally, the Mahalanobis distance (MD) between the healthy and failure stages was measured as the HI. The proposed method was tested on a benchmark bearing dataset and compared with several other traditional HI construction models. Experimental results indicate that the constructed HI exhibited a monotonically increasing degradation trend and had good performance in terms of detecting incipient faults.},

ABSTRACT = {Over the past decades, additive manufacturing has rapidly advanced due to its advantages in enabling diverse material usage and complex design production. Nevertheless, the technology has limitations in terms of quality, as printed products are sometimes different from their desired designs or are inconsistent due to defects. Warping deformation, a defect involving layer shrinkage induced by the thermal residual stress generated during manufacturing processes, is a major factor in lowering the quality and raising the cost of printed products. This study utilized a variety of thermal time series data and the K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm with dynamic time warping (DTW) to detect and predict the warping deformation in the printed parts using fused deposition modeling (FDM) printers. Multivariate thermal time series data extracted from thermocouples were trained using DTW-based KNN to classify warping deformation. The results showed that the proposed approach can predict warping deformation with an accuracy of over 80% by only using thermal time series data corresponding to 20% of the whole printing process. Additionally, the classification accuracy exhibited the promising potential of the proposed approach in warping prediction and in actual manufacturing processes, so the additional time and cost resulting from defective processes can be reduced.},

ABSTRACT = {Society and the government perceive alternative propulsions as a way out of a world of high emissions. For several years now, European countries have been trying to enforce various strategic plans in which they give maximum support to electromobility. Subsidies and emission limits for car manufacturers or strategic plans for the development of electromobility in each European country are only a small part of the enormous support for the development of this new alternative drive. However, questions arise in the energy and ecology sectors: Is Slovakia ready to increase the number of electric vehicles? Will Slovakia have enough energy sources? Are electric cars really as clean as they are presented? The article focuses on these issues and, through detailed analysis, based on individual annual reports of each sector, refutes or confirms the fact that electromobility is a promising alternative and a replacement for internal combustion engines.},

ABSTRACT = {The use of chemical kinetic mechanisms in computer aided engineering tools for internal combustion engine simulations is of high importance for studying and predicting pollutant formation of conventional and alternative fuels. However, usage of complex reaction schemes is accompanied by high computational cost in 0-D, 1-D and 3-D computational fluid dynamics frameworks. The present work aims to address this challenge and allow broader deployment of detailed chemistry-based simulations, such as in multi-objective engine optimization campaigns. A fast-running tabulated chemistry solver coupled to a 0-D probability density function-based approach for the modelling of compression and spark ignition engine combustion is proposed. A stochastic reactor engine model has been extended with a progress variable-based framework, allowing the use of pre-calculated auto-ignition tables instead of solving the chemical reactions on-the-fly. As a first validation step, the tabulated chemistry-based solver is assessed against the online chemistry solver under constant pressure reactor conditions. Secondly, performance and accuracy targets of the progress variable-based solver are verified using stochastic reactor models under compression and spark ignition engine conditions. Detailed multicomponent mechanisms comprising up to 475 species are employed in both the tabulated and online chemistry simulation campaigns. The proposed progress variable-based solver proved to be in good agreement with the detailed online chemistry one in terms of combustion performance as well as engine-out emission predictions (CO, CO2, NO and unburned hydrocarbons). Concerning computational performances, the newly proposed solver delivers remarkable speed-ups (up to four orders of magnitude) when compared to the online chemistry simulations. In turn, the new solver allows the stochastic reactor model to be computationally competitive with much lower order modeling approaches (i.e., Vibe-based models). It also makes the stochastic reactor model a feasible computer aided engineering framework of choice for multi-objective engine optimization campaigns.},

ABSTRACT = {One challenging aspect of therapy optimization and application of control algorithms in the field of tumor growth modeling is the limited number of measurable physiological signals—state variables—and the knowledge of model parameters. A possible solution to provide such information is the application of observer or state estimator. One of the most widely applied estimators for nonlinear problems is the extended Kalman filter (EKF). In this study, a moving horizon estimation (MHE)-based observer is developed and compared to an optimized EKF. The observers utilize a third-order tumor growth model. The performance of the observers is tested on measurements gathered from a laboratory mice trial using chemotherapeutic drug. The proposed MHE is designed to be suitable for closed-loop applications and yields simultaneous state and parameter estimation.},

ABSTRACT = {An experimental and numerical study is presented in the current work for gas entrainment using an inverted vertical U-tube. Water flows vertically up in an inverted U-tube which creates a low-pressure region in the tube upper portion. This low-pressure region can be used to extract gases by connecting it to a branch pipe. The extracted gases considered in this work are a mixture of air and water vapor. The water vapor from the side branch pipe is mixed with the flowing water under the siphon effect. This results in a progressive water vapor condensation as the mixture proceeds towards the exit due to an increase in vapor partial pressure. The air is drawn by inertia to be released out at the tube lower exit of the inverted U-pipe. The current study deals with these complicated flow behaviors due to the mixing undergoing condensation. A test rig is designed for experimentally studying the behavior of water flow in an inverted U-tube where the air is mixed with the flowing water at the top region of this tube. The CFD computations are accomplished for a side gas mixture with volume fractions up to 0.7 with water vapor mass fractions in this mixture to be 0.1–0.5. The tested water mass flow rates in the main tube are 2, 4, 6, 8 kg/s to account for all possible flow mass ratios. The CFD computations are validated with water and air two phase flow with the measurements of both the experiments of the current research and the literature. The present results reveal that slightly raising the water mass flow rate at a constant side mixture mass ratio produces a reduced generated pressure in the upper tube part. This is attributed to extra water vapor condensation taking place rapidly by increasing the water flow rate in the tube upper part. Furthermore, the turbulence quantities begin to break down at a side mixture volume fraction of 0.55 with water and air mass flow rates of 2 kg/s and 0.002 kg/s, respectively. On the other side, raising the air mass flow rate at the higher values of water vapor and water mass flow rates breaks the generated vacuum pressure and turbulence due to entrainment. Moreover, this proposed framework can produce a lower static pressure, reaching 55.1 kPa, which makes it attractive for gas extraction. This new technique presents innovative usage with less consumable energy for extracting gases in engineering equipment.},

ABSTRACT = {The smart textiles and wearable technology markets are expanding tirelessly, looking for efficient solutions to create long-lasting products. The research towards novel integration methods and increasing reliability of wearables and electronic textiles (e-textiles) is expanding. One obstacle to be tackled is the washability and the endurance to mechanical stresses in the washing machine. In this article, different layering of thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) films and knit fabrics are used to integrate three different designs of stretchable copper-based meander tracks with printed circuit boards. The various combinations are washed according to the ISO 6330-2012 standard to analyze their endurance. Results suggest that one meander design withstands more washing cycles and indicate that the well-selected layer compositions increase the reliability. Higher stretchability together with greater durability is accomplished by adding an extra meander-shaped TPU film layer.},

ABSTRACT = {Sandwich panels have proven to be excellent energy absorbents. Such panels may be used as a protective structure in, for example, façades subjected to explosions. In this study, the dynamic response of sandwich structures subjected to blast loading has been investigated both experimentally and numerically, utilizing a shock tube facility. Sandwich panels made of aluminium skins and a core of extruded polystyrene (XPS) with different densities were subjected to various blast load intensities. Low-velocity impact tests on XPS samples were also conducted for validation and calibration of a viscoplastic extension of the Deshpande-Fleck crushable foam model. The experimental results revealed a significant increase in blast load mitigation for sandwich panels compared to skins without a foam core, and that the back-skin deformation and the core compression correlated with the foam density. Numerical models of the shock tube tests were created using LS-DYNA, incorporating the new viscoplastic formulation of the foam material. The numerical models were able to capture the trends observed in the experimental tests, and good quantitative agreement between the experimental and predicted responses was in general obtained. One aim of this study is to provide high-precision experimental data, combined with a validated numerical modelling strategy, that can be used in simulation-based optimisation of sandwich panels exposed to blast loading.},

ABSTRACT = {Cable-driven parallel robots can provide interesting advantages over conventional robots with rigid links; in particular, robots with a cable-suspended architecture can have very large workspaces. Recent research has shown that dynamic trajectories allow the robot to further increase its workspace by taking advantage of inertial effects. In our work, we consider a three-degrees-of-freedom parallel robot suspended by three cables, with a point-mass end-effector. This model was considered in previous works to analyze the conditions for dynamical feasibility of a trajectory. Here, we enhance the robot’s capabilities by using it as a sling, that is, by throwing a mass at a suitable time. The mass is carried at the end-effector by a gripper, which releases the mass so that it can reach a given target point. Mathematical models are presented that provide guidelines for planning the trajectory. Moreover, results are shown from simulations that include the effect of cable elasticity. Finally, suggestions are offered regarding how such a trajectory can be optimized.},

ABSTRACT = {In robotic teleoperation, hard impacts between a tool and the manipulated object may impair the success of a task. In order to develop a robotic system that is able to minimize the final velocity of an object after impact, a comprehensive approach is adopted in this work, and the effect on the impact of the parameters of the tool and of the robot is studied. Mass, contact stiffness and damping, robot compliance and control and tool compliance are taken into account. A mathematical model including the tool and the robot moving along the approach direction shows that, in most conditions, robot compliance is not enough to mitigate the impact. A mechanical decoupling between the inertia of the tool and the inertia of the robot is needed. An elastic system based on a bi-stable mechanism is developed and its validity is shown by means of numerical simulations.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper deals with the numerical analysis of the particle inertia and volume fraction effects on colliding particle-pair velocity correlation immersed in an unsteady isotropic homogeneous turbulent flow. Such correlation function is required to build reliable statistical models for inter-particle collisions, in the frame of the Euler–Lagrange approach, to be used in a broad range of two-phase flow applications. Computations of the turbulent flow have been carried out by means of Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) by the Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM). Moreover, the dependence of statistical properties of collisions on particle inertia and volumetric fraction is evaluated and quantified. It has been found that collision locations of particles of intermediate inertia, StK~1, occurs in regions where the fluid strain rate and dissipation are higher than the corresponding averaged values at particle positions. Connected with this fact, the average kinetic energy of colliding particles of intermediate inertia (i.e., Stokes number around 1) is lower than the value averaged over all particles. From the study of the particle-pair velocity correlation, it has been demonstrated that the colliding particle-pair velocity correlation function cannot be approximated by the Eulerian particle-pair correlation, obtained by theoretical approaches, as particle separation tends to zero, a fact related with the larger values of the relative radial velocity between colliding particles.},

ABSTRACT = {In the existing automobile manufacturing process, metal inert gas (MIG) and tungsten inert gas (TIG) welding are mainly used. These welding methods are fusion welding, and the heat input in the welding area is very high. Therefore, the deformation of the base material is large, and the residual stress in the vicinity of the welded area is high, resulting in the problem of reduced mechanical strength. In this study, friction stir welding (FSW) was applied to the welding process of the structure constituting the battery frame of a newly developing electric vehicle to compensate for this problem. The welded part is the fillet joint of the side frame and the bottom frame, and experiments and numerical analysis were performed on the welding deformation and residual stress of the full frame structure. A specially manufactured angle head was used for friction stir welding of the fillet joint of extruded type aluminum, not the existing solid type. The optimum process was derived through experiments, and the temperature of the welding center was derived through test correlation between the value of measured temperature and the finite element model. The final deformation result was verified by comparing it with the measured value using a dial indicator. It is expected that the proposed thermal elasto-plastic analysis method will reduce the testing period and the cost of the manufacturing process and increase productivity.},

The alkaline nature of the corrosion products containing manganese oxide (MnO) increases the dissolution kinetics of the TWIP steel in acid media, obtaining Mn2+ cations in solution, and producing the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) surface analysis revealed an increased Al2O3 content of 91% in the passive layer of the recrystallized TWIP steel specimen, while in contrast only a 43% Al2O3 was found on the TMP specimen. Additionally, the chemical composition of the surface oxide layer as well as the TWIP alloy microstructure was analyzed by optical microscopy (OM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results indicate an enhanced corrosion attack for the TMP high-Mn TWIP steel.},

ABSTRACT = {Accurate modeling of tire characteristics is one of the most challenging tasks. Many mathematical models can be used to fit measured data. Identification of the parameters of these models usually relies on least squares optimization techniques. Different researchers have shown that the proper selection of an initial set of parameters is key to obtain a successful fitting. Besides, the mathematical process to identify the right parameters is, in some cases, quite time-consuming and not adequate for fast computing. This paper investigates the possibility of using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to reliably identify tire model parameters. In this case, the Pacejka’s “Magic Formula” has been chosen for the identification due to its complex mathematical form which, in principle, could result in a more difficult learning than other formulations. The proposed methodology is based on the creation of a sufficiently large training dataset, without errors, by randomly choosing the MF parameters within a range compatible with reality. The results obtained in this paper suggest that the use of ANN to directly identify parameters in tire models for real test data is possible without the need of complicated cost functions, iterative fitting or initial iteration point definition. The errors in the identification are normally very low for every parameter and the fitting problem time is reduced to a few milliseconds for any new given data set, which makes this methodology very appropriate to be used in applications where the computing time needs to be reduced to a minimum.},

ABSTRACT = {Even though the rules for the free circulation of machinery within the European Union (EU) market have existed for more than 30 years, accidents related to their activities have constantly been reaching significant value. When designing a machine, the design must stem from a risk assessment, where all stages of its life cycle and the ways to use it must be taken into consideration. In industrial operations with old machinery, despite fulfilling its function reliably, the safety level is below the developing requirements for safe operations. The proposed methodology to assess machinery safety conditions comes from the assumption of the proper application of risk assessment steps and their effectiveness in risk reduction mainly through implementing both effective and efficient preventive measures. The objective of the research applied in three operations was to verify the methods concerning machinery safety and its management. The created methodology, based on 19 requirements for safety, evaluates the level of current measures using a criterion of the current safety status and the total effectiveness of safety measures. Its output is the assessment of the efficiency level of the implemented safety measures of each machine as well as of the whole operation.},

ABSTRACT = {The creation of modern machines and improvement of existing designs of rock cutting bodies of combines is constrained by the lack of experimental studies of the process of separation of successive elementary cleavages during the potash ore cutting with cutters of winning machines. The potential of the cross cutting pattern of potash ore is shown, since the formation of zones of localization of weakening and induced fractures on the surface of layer-by-layer cutting face determines the separation of the elementary cleavages with stable geometric parameters. The verification of the conclusions obtained theoretically was carried out during laboratory tastings on a specially designed bench. The research procedure provided for comparative tests of the potash block ore cutting, staggered and cross cuttings. It has been proven that the use of the cross pattern for set cutting parameters makes it possible to reduce the specific energy costs of the cutting of potash mass, to reduce the average load on the cutter, to reduce the root-mean-square deviation, and to reduce the number of fractions that are hard to enrich in the crushing products, compared to the traditional staggered cutting pattern.},

ABSTRACT = {The safety of vulnerable road users is of paramount importance as transport moves towards fully automated driving. The richness of real-world data required for testing autonomous vehicles is limited and furthermore, available data do not present a fair representation of different scenarios and rare events. Before deploying autonomous vehicles publicly, their abilities must reach a safety threshold, not least with regards to vulnerable road users, such as pedestrians. In this paper, we present a novel Generative Adversarial Networks named the Ped-Cross GAN. Ped-Cross GAN is able to generate crossing sequences of pedestrians in the form of human pose sequences. The Ped-Cross GAN is trained with the Pedestrian Scenario dataset. The novel Pedestrian Scenario dataset, derived from existing datasets, enables training on richer pedestrian scenarios. We demonstrate an example of its use through training and testing the Ped-Cross GAN. The results show that the Ped-Cross GAN is able to generate new crossing scenarios that are of the same distribution from those contained in the Pedestrian Scenario dataset. Having a method with these capabilities is important for the future of transport, as it will allow for the adequate testing of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles on how they correctly perceive the intention of pedestrians crossing the street, ultimately leading to fewer pedestrian casualties on our roads.},

ABSTRACT = {Flow separation and dynamic stall occurring at a high angle of attack will lead to difficulty in control and maneuverability for morphing aircraft. This study proposes a novel active flow control technology using a synthetic jet actuator for the roll motion of morphing aircraft. With the help of the computational fluid dynamics method and vortex lattice method, the roll control model of morphing aircraft undergoing large shape change at a high angle of attack is established. In this model, both the array of the actuator with an optimized cavity shape and morphing span, which are subject to the input saturation constraint, are used to mimic the conventional control surface. Integrated flight control based on the sliding mode control method is designed to ensure the desired closed-loop asymptotic stability, wherein the radial basis function neural network is employed to provide the compensation induced by the input saturation constraint. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the control scheme, various control strategies for different combinations of input are proposed to maintain the roll motion. The numerical results show that the designed control law could track the target signal well, which suggests that the virtual control surface is an effective tool for maintaining the high flight performance of morphing aircraft.},

ABSTRACT = {Intravenous (IV) infusion therapy allows the infusion fluid to be inserted directly into the patient’s vein. It is used to place medications directly into the bloodstream or for blood transfusions. The probability that a hospitalized patient will receive some kind of infusion therapy, intravenously, is 60–80%. The paper presents a smart IV infusion dosing system for detection, signaling, and monitoring of liquid in an IV bottle at a remote location. It consists of (i) the sensing and computation layer—a system for detection and signaling of fluid levels in the IV bottle and a system for regulation and closing of infusion flow, (ii) the communication layer—a wireless exchange of information between the hardware part of the system and the client, and (iii) the user layer—monitoring and visualization of IV therapy reception at a remote location in real time. All layers are modular, allowing upgrades of the entire system. The proposed system alerts medical staff to continuous and timely changes of IV bottles, which can have positive effects on increasing the success of IV therapy, especially in oncology patients. The prescribed drip time of IV chemotherapy for the full effect of cytostatics should be imperative.},

ABSTRACT = {In this research, 200 corrosion images of steel and 500 crack images of rubber bearing are collected and manually labeled to build the data set. Then the two data sets are respectively adopted to train VGG-Unet models in two methods, aiming to conduct Damage Segmentation by inputting different size of data set. One method is Squashing Segmentation to input squashed images from high resolution directly into VGG-Unet model while Cropping Segmentation uses cropped image with size 224 × 224 as input images. Because the proportion of damage pixels in the data set is different, the results produced by the two data sets are quite different. For large size damage (such as corrosion) segmentation, Cropping Segmentation has a better result while for minor damage (such as crack) segmentation, the result is opposite. The main reason is the gap in the concentration of valid data from the data set. To improve the capability of crack segmentation based on Cropping Segmentation, Background Data Drop Rate (BDDR) is adopted to reduce the quantity of background images to control the proportion of damage pixels from the data set in pixel-level. The ratio of damage pixels from the data set can be decided by different value of BDDR. By testing, the accuracy of Cropping Segmentation becomes relatively higher under BDDR being 0.8.},

ABSTRACT = {The tremendous success of automated methods for the detection of damage in images of civil infrastructure has been fueled by exponential advances in deep learning over the past decade. In particular, many efforts have taken place in academia and more recently in industry that demonstrate the success of supervised deep learning methods for semantic segmentation of damage (i.e., the pixel-wise identification of damage in images). However, in graduating from the detection of damage to applications such as inspection automation, efforts have been limited by the lack of large open datasets of real-world images with annotations for multiple types of damage, and other related information such as material and component types. Such datasets for structural inspections are difficult to develop because annotating the complex and amorphous shapes taken by damage patterns remains a tedious task (requiring too many clicks and careful selection of points), even with state-of-the art annotation software. In this work, InstaDam—an open source software platform for fast pixel-wise annotation of damage—is presented. By utilizing binary masks to aid user input, InstaDam greatly speeds up the annotation process and improves the consistency of annotations. The masks are generated by applying established image processing techniques (IPTs) to the images being annotated. Several different tunable IPTs are implemented to allow for rapid annotation of a wide variety of damage types. The paper first describes details of InstaDam’s software architecture and presents some of its key features. Then, the benefits of InstaDam are explored by comparing it to the Image Labeler app in Matlab. Experiments are conducted where two employed student annotators are given the task of annotating damage in a small dataset of images using Matlab, InstaDam without IPTs, and InstaDam. Comparisons are made, quantifying the improvements in annotation speed and annotation consistency across annotators. A description of the statistics of the different IPTs used for different annotated classes is presented. The gains in annotation consistency and efficiency from using InstaDam will facilitate the development of datasets that can help to advance research into automation of visual inspections.},

ABSTRACT = {The main purpose of this study was to develop and validate a 3D model for calculating knee joint loads during seated cycling. A 3D inverse dynamics approach was used to calculate knee and ankle joint loads using kinematics and kinetics data. For such a model, four kinematics clusters and three pedal markers were used, integrated with a 6-component force/torque pedal dynamometer. Seven subjects performed one five-minute trial on 75% of their maximum power at fixed cadence of 85 rpms. Data from two consecutive samples of the same cycling trial (first and last minute) were used to validate the model with the mean difference between two samples, Cronbach’s alpha, intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), and p-value. Results showed high ICC (>0.735) and internal consistency (>0.700) with no statistically significant values (p > 0.050) except for crank angle of peak anterior force and peak axial forces at the knee and minimum normal force (p = 0.010) and minimum crank angle (p = 0.010) on the pedal. Further analyses are required to validate the model between days and to test the sensitivity to mechanical constraints.},

ABSTRACT = {Reinforcing steel bars (rebars) are widely manufactured using the Tempcore™ process. Several studies have been conducted analyzing the effect of the heat treatment route on the strength and corrosion resistance of rebars, but knowledge of its effects on the residual stresses of the finished product are largely lacking. This paper presents experimental investigations to identify the material parameters necessary to simulate the Tempcore™ process using thermo-elasto-plastic constitutive modeling in order to study the generation of residual stresses during the manufacturing process. Mechanical parameters such as yield strength at elevated temperatures and elastic constants were determined experimentally. A continuous cooling transformation diagram needed to model the phase transformations was also identified and is presented here. Residual stress distributions in the surface region of the rebar were characterized using X-ray diffraction. Further characterizations of microstructure, chemical composition, and hardness were carried out. The constitutive modeling approach for the numerical simulation is briefly described for which the experimentally determined parameters are required as input.},

ABSTRACT = {In construction, a large-scale 3D printing method for construction is used to build houses quickly, based on Computerized Aid Design. Currently, the construction industry is beginning to apply quite a lot of 3D printing technologies to create buildings that require a quick construction time and complex structures that classical methods cannot implement. In this paper, a Cable-Driven Parallel Robot (CDPR) is described for the 3D printing of concrete for building a house. The CDPR structures are designed to be suitable for 3D printing in a large workspace. A linear programming algorithm was used to quickly calculate the inverse kinematic problem with the force equilibrium condition for the moving platform; this method is suitable for the flexible configuration of a CDPR corresponding to the various spaces. Cable sagging was also analyzed by the Trust-Region-Dogleg algorithm to increase the accuracy of the inverse kinematic problem for controlling the robot to perform basic trajectory interpolation movements. The paper also covers the design and analysis of a concrete extruder for the 3D printing method. The analytical results are experimented with based on a prototype of the CDPR to evaluate the work ability and suitability of this design. The results show that this design is suitable for 3D printing in construction, with high precision and a stable trajectory printing. The robot configuration can be easily adjusted and calculated to suit the construction space, while maintaining rigidity as well as an adequate operating space. The actuators are compact, easy to disassemble and move, and capable of accommodating a wide variety of dimensions.},

ABSTRACT = {At present, most of the research on low velocity impact of composite laminates focuses on load location and damage assessment. To provide further early warnings about structural impact damage, impact energy can be monitored and identified. For high strength composite laminates with variable thickness, in order to further accurately evaluate the impact energy, it is necessary to adopt more suitable dynamic load signal analysis and impact energy identification methods. Therefore, a new low velocity impact monitoring and identification method for composite plates with variable thickness is proposed. All impact sample signals collected by optical fiber sensor network are decomposed by whitening Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD); the energy feature set is established according to the impact energy eigenvalue of sample signal; according to the first order component of signal decomposition, the thickness coefficient is determined and the energy feature set is modified to evaluate the actual impact energy. Meanwhile, combined with optical fiber sensing and signal processing technology, an impact energy monitoring system has been established, and the low velocity impact monitoring and identification experiments of composite laminates with variable thickness were carried out. The proposed energy identification method successfully identified 1–3 J impact energy with an average error of 4.82%, and the average error of large thickness area with low sensitivity was significantly reduced from 13.25% to 5.67%. The results show that the thickness coefficient correction method based on whitening EMD can evaluate the low velocity impact energy more accurately, and the thickness coefficient correction step significantly improves the recognition performance.},

ABSTRACT = {The interaction of pressure and flow in a hydraulic system with multiple working conditions, multiple actuators, and large flow limits action adjustment and control. Through a pilot pressure control circuit, hydraulically operated valves can adjust pressure or direction more effectively. A recent study proposed a two-stage pressure control method based on multistage orifices and solenoid valves. The requirements of the number and diameter ratio of short orifices in the series to realize the two-stage pressure control were theoretically analyzed. Scheme design and experiment were carried out. The influence of structures of complex flow channel and solenoid valve on the higher or lower pilot control pressure was considered in the experiment. The method was experimentally verified and successfully applied in a turbine electrohydraulic control system with lower maintenance costs, making the system more reliable in the case of electrical failure. Research results provide insight into pilot pressure control in fluid systems using multistage orifices to achieve either higher or lower pressure. In addition, it has important guiding significance for the design of valves or engineering systems based on pilot hydraulic pressure.},

ABSTRACT = {A bare AISI420J2 punch often suffers from severe adhesion of metallic titanium as well as titanium oxide debris particles in dry, cold forging of biomedical titanium alloys. This punch was plasma-carburized at 673 K for 14.4 ks to harden it up to 1200 HV on average and to achieve carbon supersaturation in the carburized layer. This plasma-carburized punch was employed in the cold, dry forging of a pure titanium wire into a flat plate while reducing the thickness by 70%. The contact interface width approached the forged workpiece width with increasing the reduction ratio. This smaller bulging deformation reveals that the workpiece is upset by homogeneous plastic flow with a lower friction coefficient. This low-friction and anti-galling forging process was sustained by an in situ solid lubrication mechanism. Unbound free carbon was isolated from the carbon-supersaturated AISI420J2 matrix and deposited as a thin tribofilm to protect the contact interface from mass transfer of metallic titanium.},

It can be viewed as the distinguishability of the impacts of local input on the final global output, that is to say, whether the input at the local level can be recovered uniquely under a given output at the global level and initial state. The interconnected system constitutes two dynamic subsystems connected in a cascade manner. In order to guarantee the invertibility of the studied system, a necessary and sufficient condition was established. On the condition that both individual subsystems are invertible, the invertibility of the global system can be guaranteed. In order to recover the local input which generates a given global output, an algorithm was proposed for the studied interconnected system. Numerical examples were considered to confirm the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed algorithm.},

ABSTRACT = {Combining the knowledge about additive manufacturing technologies available in the literature with the results of empirical research in Polish manufacturing enterprises, regarding the implementation of AM, using the Bayesian network, will allow the recent demand for AM technologies to be defined in the context of an industry’s needs. The main purpose of the study is to build a new model that integrates: (1) knowledge about the implementation of AM in manufacturing companies, gained from the literature, (2) knowledge about the demands and state of the use of AM from 250 Polish metal and automotive manufacturing enterprises, and (3) Bayesian networks. The results reveal that the model developed is able to accurately detect the key determinants of the implementation process of AM technologies within a manufacturing company and identify the specific requirements for the further implementation of additive technologies. The freshness of our work is defining the demand for AM technology based on the knowledge gained from literature and knowledge received through empirical study. The possibilities of using the results of research in economic practice were demonstrated. This new approach can be treated as a solution, which will both direct and help mangers to take the decision to implement AM technologies.},

ABSTRACT = {The study includes a parametric analysis of a group of tensegrity plate-like structures built with modified Quartex modules. The quantitative assessment, including the calculation of the structure’s response to constant loads, was carried out. A static parametric analysis was performed, with particular emphasis on the influence of the initial prestress level on the displacements, the effort, and the stiffness of the structure. A geometrical non-linear model was used in the analysis. A reliable assessment required introducing a parameter for determining the influence of the initial prestress level on the overall stiffness of the structure at a given load. The stiffness of the structure was found to depend not only on the geometry and material properties, but also on the initial prestress level and external load. The results show that the effect of the initial prestress on the overall stiffness of the structure is greater with less load and that the effect of load is most significant with low pre-stressing forces. The analysis demonstrates that the control of static parameters is possible only when infinitesimal mechanisms occur in the structure.},

ABSTRACT = {It is essential to reduce structural damages caused by earthquakes in severe conditions, such as layered ground, especially when a soft soil layer is close to the surface. In this study, the kinematic and inertial interactions, two mechanisms of soil–foundation–structure interaction (SFSI), of different soil–foundation–structure systems (SFS) were investigated on uniform and layered grounds. Two layered soil profiles composed of a low stiffness layer laid over another were prepared in an equivalent shear beam container. Nine centrifuge experiments were carried out for three structures located on the surface of each ground and exposed to the Hachinohe earthquake while increasing the peak acceleration of the input motion. Numerical simulations were performed to simulate the centrifuge tests. It was found that roof motion (RM) of the tall structure increased in layered profile even though the free-field motion (FFM) decreased compared to homogeneous ground. The appearance of a soft layer beneath structures modifies the SFS system’s stiffness that causes kinematic and inertial interactions to alter to those on uniform soil profile.},

ABSTRACT = {Assembly path planning of complex products in virtual assembly is a necessary and complicated step, which will become long and inefficient if the assembly path of each part is completely planned in the assembly space. The coincidence or partial coincidence of the assembly paths of some parts provides an opportunity to solve this problem. A path planning algorithm based on prior path reuse (PPR algorithm) is proposed in this paper, which realizes rapid planning of an assembly path by reusing the planned paths. The core of the PPR algorithm is a dual-tree fusion strategy for path reuse, which is implemented by improving the rapidly exploring random tree star (RRT *) algorithm. The dual-tree fusion strategy is used to find the nearest prior node, the prior connection node, the nearest exploring node, and the exploring connection node and to connect the exploring tree to the prior tree after the exploring tree is extended to the prior space. Then, the optimal path selection strategy is used to calculate the costs of all planned paths and select the one with the minimum cost as the optimal path. The PPR algorithm is compared with the RRT * algorithm in path planning for one start node and multiple start nodes. The results show that the total time and the number of sampling points for assembly path planning of batch parts using the PPR algorithm are far less than those using the RRT * algorithm.},

Weld defects due to a lack of fusion were detected in some regions of specimens treated with a low-power laser region (3 J/mm), where a lack of fusion, in turn, occurred due to underheating. Bubble-shaped weld defects were observed in some specimens treated with a high-power laser region (5 J/mm); melting occurred due to the overheating of the specimen. Computer simulations were used to trace the boundaries of the fusion zone, and yielded results similar to the visual inspection ones. In the lower-energy region, the energy may not be sufficient to fuse the specimen, whereas the high-energy region may have sufficient energy to break down the polymer chains. A novel deep learning algorithm was used to statistically evaluate the weld quality. Approximately 1700–1900 samples were collected for each condition, and the pre-trained quality evaluation indicated a highly reliable (>98%) welding classification (fail or good). According to the results of this study, welding quality assessments based on visual inspection, computer simulation, and DL-based inspection yield similar results.},

ABSTRACT = {The use of a chevron nozzle/orifice is one of the methods of heat transfer enhancement and noise reduction. In the case of synthetic jets, the number of papers on this topic is small. Therefore, a synthetic jet actuator with three different chevron orifices and one circular orifice is investigated. The aim of this study is to find the impact of orifice shape on centerline velocity (measured with a hot-wire anemometer) and determine if the chevron orifice reduces the generated noise. The sound pressure level was strongly dependent on the input actuator’s power, and only one chevron orifice ensured noise reduction for low power (p = 6; 8 W). At real power p = 12 W, the sound pressure level was lower for each chevron orifice actuator than in the case of the circular orifice actuator. It is shown that the application of a chevron nozzle does not have to provide noise reduction. It is important in the case of the design of new actuators that are to operate in places where noise levels should be limited (e.g., offices).},

ABSTRACT = {In the field of food packaging, the addition of exfoliated layered silicates in polymers has been established to improve the polymers’ gas barrier properties. Using these polymers as coatings to protect smart textiles from oxidation and corrosion while maintaining their textile properties should significantly extend their lifetime and promote their market penetration. The aim of this study was to print new polymer dispersions containing layered silicates to protect screen-printed conductive structures, and to test the resulting samples. For this, appropriate printing parameters were determined by statistical design of experiments. According to these results, conductive structures were printed and protected with the selected coating. The abrasion resistance and the continuity of the protective layer of the printed samples were then measured. A continuous protective coating of approximately 70–80 µm thickness was applied on a conductive structure. The printed samples showed a very high resistance to abrasion (unchanged by 85,000 abrasion cycles) while remaining flexible and presenting a lower water vapor permeability (<2.5 g/m² d) than the coatings commonly used in the textile field.},

ABSTRACT = {Transmission compliance and hysteresis behaviors are associated with harmonic drives. The experimental observation of a harmonic drive showed that these behaviors are significantly degraded with increasing service time, and their accurate modeling is expected to improve the performance of the control system of harmonic drive-based devices such as robot manipulators. In this paper, a new model is proposed to capture transmission compliance and hysteresis and their degradation. The phenomenon is represented through a combination of the nonlinear stiffness component and the micro-sliding friction in the tooth engagement area. The proposed model considered the multi-tooth meshing and the interference effects of the reducer. The parameters of the model were identified using optimization techniques. Numerical simulations and experimental data using a specialized harmonic drive test device were compared to demonstrate the proposed model.},

ABSTRACT = {The work carried out has the purpose of improving and optimizing various industrial technical operations, such as preventive maintenance, taken here as an example of application, using the Design for Disassembly (DfD) technique. Therefore, through four metaheuristic methods that have been chosen among the most widespread in the field (described below) to make a comparison between them, the optimal disassembly sequence is sought, if it exists, in terms of time and then costs in order to extract a target component without damaging the other mechanical parts of the assembly. The hypothesis that has been tested throughout this case study is “a responsible application of DfD, not only from the design process of a product but also during the disassembly procedure, can bring substantial benefits to the company”. Interaction with a hypothetical operator in charge of the work to be performed is implemented with the use of augmented reality. In fact, through an application programmed for an Android device (in this case, a mobile phone, hence a handheld device), the operator can be instructed step-by-step on the disassembly sequence in dynamics as an animation. Finally, two virtual buttons were added in augmented reality with which the operator can start and pause/resume the animation at any time to facilitate the understanding of the different steps established by the sequence.},

ABSTRACT = {Heat, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) is a crucial system for maintaining acceptable air quality and keeping the building and its occupants healthy. There are some challenges in controlling and identifying this system as it commonly operates in different operation conditions. Furthermore, various types of un-controlled sources disturb the steady operations. In addition, an HVAC system is an inherently nonlinear system and varies with time. As a result, conventional methods are not successful in identifying and controlling this system. This paper proposes a new multi-model approach in which the clustering and regression steps are performed simultaneously to tackle this problem. Cost functions of clustering and regression steps are combined and optimized using an iterative algorithm. After identifying the local models, a gap metric based approach is used to develop a global model of the process. The proposed approach is tested on a simulated ventilation unit system and real-world dataset. The results show the performance of the proposed method of identifying the ventilation system.},

ABSTRACT = {The flexoelectricity, which is a new electromechanical coupling phenomenon between strain gradients and electric polarization, has a great influence on the fracture analysis of flexoelectric solids due to the large gradients near the cracks. On the other hand, although the flexoelectricity has been extensively investigated in recent decades, the study on flexoelectricity in nonhomogeneous materials is still rare, especially the fracture problems. Therefore, in this manuscript, the conservation integrals for nonhomogeneous flexoelectric materials are obtained to solve the fracture problem. Application of operators such as grad, div, and curl to electric Gibbs free energy and internal energy, the energy-momentum tensor, angular momentum tensor, and dilatation flux can also be derived. We examine the correctness of the conservation integrals by comparing with the previous work and discuss the operator method here and Noether theorem in the previous work. Finally, considering the flexoelectric effect, a nonhomogeneous beam problem with crack is solved to show the application of the conservation integrals.},

ABSTRACT = {Adaptive tracking control of the speed of a very elastically attached circular load driven by a direct current motor accompanied with an adaptive conventional and a fractional-order Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) controller is studied. It refers to improving the closed-loop control system response of elastically coupled components of drivelines. The motor and the load mechatronic models and the block diagrams are constructed. Parameters of the PID controller in the model reference control are both constant, as well as vary in time. The adaptive control method is improved by the application of a new closed-loop control structure canceling error dynamics. A few competing control strategies are tested based on the application of two types low and high frequency stepwise increasing variations of loading torque and damping coefficient of motion. Moreover, the performance of the control strategies is verified by Integral Time-Weighted Absolute Error (ITAE) index, since their robustness is evaluated by applying a sine modulated triangle waves of selected electric parameters. Therefore, a dynamic forcing and parameter uncertainty is applied. Simulation results are compared for checking the proposed methods.},

The redesign proposal is to obtain a smaller and more portable device that can recreate the motion trajectories of a finger. The real finger motion trajectories were recorded using a motion capture system. The article focused on the optimal synthesis of the rehabilitation device mechanism formulated as a classic trajectory generation problem. The proposed approach was combined with the recorded finger movements and solved using the genetic algorithm (GA) method. Optimization criteria and constraints were successively formulated and solved using a mono-objective function.},
