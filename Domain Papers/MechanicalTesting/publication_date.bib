ABSTRACT = {With the advancement of technology, mining trucks are gradually becoming larger, imposing higher performance requirements on the front suspension. There is a need to transform the original integral non-independent front axle of mining dump trucks with a payload exceeding 300 tons into an independent front suspension with a double-wishbone suspension. The changing of the front suspension is bound to have an impact on the overall vehicle’s handling stability and ride comfort. Therefore, the following research is conducted to investigate and analyze these effects. Firstly, the paper proposes a method for optimizing the parameters of the double-wishbone front suspension. The double-wishbone front suspension is modeled, and a comparison with a kinematic model is conducted to validate the accuracy of the model. Secondly, unreasonable hardpoint parameters are optimized. Thirdly, a dynamic model of the entire vehicle is established based on the optimized parameters, and an analysis of handling stability and ride comfort for the entire vehicle is performed. Finally, simulation results are compared and analyzed against experimental data. The results indicate that the optimized positioning parameters not only effectively enhance the suspension performance of the mining dump truck but also meet the requirements for handling stability and smoothness. The overall smoothness of the vehicle is significantly improved after the modification. This study not only holds significant engineering value in reducing vibrations in dump trucks and enhancing driver comfort, but also provides theoretical support for subsequent research and development in the industry.},

ABSTRACT = {This study introduces an advanced lateral control strategy for autonomous vehicles using a clothoid-based approach integrated with an adaptive lookahead mechanism. The primary focus is on enhancing lateral stability and path-tracking accuracy through the application of Euler spirals for smooth curvature transitions, thereby reducing passenger discomfort and the risk of vehicle rollover. An innovative aspect of our work is the adaptive adjustment of lookahead distance based on real-time vehicle dynamics and road geometry, which ensures optimal path following under varying conditions. A quasi-feedback control algorithm constructs optimal clothoids at each time step, generating the appropriate steering input. A lead filter compensates for the vehicle’s lateral dynamics lag, improving control responsiveness and stability. The effectiveness of the proposed controller is validated through a comprehensive co-simulation using TruckSim® and Simulink®, demonstrating significant improvements in lateral control performance across diverse driving scenarios. Future directions include scaling the controller for higher-speed applications and further optimization to minimize off-track errors, particularly for articulated vehicles.},

ABSTRACT = {In real-time production planning, there are exceptional events that can cause problems and deviations in the production schedule. These circumstances can be solved with real-time production planning, which is able to quickly reschedule the operations at each work centre. Mobile autonomous robots are a key element in this real-time planning and are a fundamental link between production centres. Work centres in Industry 4.0 environments can use current technology, i.e., a biomimetic strategy that emulates echolocation, with the aim of establishing bidirectional communication with other work centres through the application of agile algorithms. Taking advantage of these communication capabilities, the basic idea is to distribute the execution of the algorithm among different work centres that interact like a parasympathetic system that makes automatic movements to reorder the production schedule. The aim is to use algorithms with an optimal solution based on the simplicity of the task distribution, trying to avoid heuristic algorithms or heavy computations. This paper presents the following result: the development of an Industrial Sonar algorithm which allows real-time scheduling and obtains the optimal solution at all times. The objective of this is to reduce the makespan, reduce energy costs and carbon footprint, and reduce the waiting and transport times for autonomous mobile robots using the Internet of Things, cloud computing and machine learning technologies to emulate echolocation.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper addresses a novel multi-skill resource-constrained project scheduling problem with flexible resource profiles (F-MSRCPSP), in which the resource allocation of each activity consists of a certain number of discrete resources and is allowed to be adjusted over its duration. The F-MSRCPSP aims, therefore, to determine the flexible resource profile of each activity to minimize the make-span and total cost simultaneously. Then, a hybrid multi-objective fruit fly optimization algorithm is proposed to handle the concerned problem. In the proposed algorithm, two flexible parallel and serial schedule generation schemes are introduced, aiming to schedule activities and adjust allocated resource combinations. Additionally, two heuristic strategies are proposed to effectively select suitable resource combinations for activities. Moreover, a series of operators has been developed, including the rejoining operator, empirical re-arrangement operator, and empirical re-selection operator. These operators aim to accelerate the convergence speed and enhance the exploration of the proposed algorithm. Finally, the orthogonal test is used to select the optimal parameter combination, and comparative experiments based on tests with different scales are conducted, along with a t-test. The experimental results demonstrate that MOFOA-HS is effective in solving the F-MSRCPSP.},

ABSTRACT = {When subjected to extreme loads and ultra-low cycling conditions, the primary mode of failure in a ball screw is that excessive plastic contact deformation of the raceway surface exceeds acceptable limits. Consequently, traditional fatigue life theories based on pitting fatigue are not applicable in this context. This study evaluated the load distribution within the ball screw, considering factors such as the nut position and screw length. The plastic deformation of the raceway surfaces is analyzed using Thornton’s elastoplastic theory. Furthermore, this paper integrates the concepts of plastic deformation and fatigue elastic life to investigate the fatigue elastic life of ball screws under extreme conditions. To validate the proposed approach, the calculated results are compared with those from previous experimental studies, confirming its effectiveness. When the ratio of the nut position to the screw length approaches 0.7, the fatigue elastic life of the ball screw achieves its maximum. An increase in screw length, load, or raceway conformity ratio leads to a decrease in fatigue elastic life. Conversely, an increase in contact angle and ball diameter enhances the fatigue elastic life.},

ABSTRACT = {The purpose of this study is to develop an evaluation method for assessing the relative relationship between gear tooth shape deviations on every gear tooth using network theory. Our previous study introduced a method for representing the phase difference between each helix deviation as a network, demonstrating that it is possible to identify the relative relationship between gear tooth deviations. However, there has been no in-depth analysis of the impact of injection molding on the gear’s phase difference network. In this paper, we begin by measuring the gear tooth shape deviation, calculating the correlation coefficient, and expressing it as an adjacency matrix. When the adjacency matrix was visualized and displayed as a pixel plot, a periodic pattern was formed. The relationship between the position of the gate used to inject molten resin material into the injection mold and the pixel plot were then investigated in detail, and it was confirmed that the helix deviation network of a gear manufactured with the injection molding process is useful as a new indicator for the manufacturing error of injection-molded plastic gear.},

ABSTRACT = {The present study focuses on performing multi-objective optimization of the cyclone separator geometry to lower the pressure losses and enhance the collection efficiency. For this, six geometrical entities, such as the main body diameter of the cyclone, the vortex finder diameter and its insertion length, the cone tip diameter, and the height of the cylindrical and conical segment, have been accounted for optimization, and the Muschelknautz method of modeling has been used as an objective function for genetic algorithms. To date, this is one of the most popular mathematical models that accurately predicts the cyclone performance, such as the pressure drop and cut-off particle size. Three cases have been selected from the Pareto fronts, and the cyclone performance is calculated using advanced closure large-eddy simulation—the results are then compared to the baseline model to evaluate the relative improvement. It has been observed that in one of the models, with merely a 2% reduction in the collection efficiency and an increase of 12% in the cut-off particle size, more than a 43% reduction in pressure drop value was obtained (an energy-efficient model). In another model, a nearly 25% increment in the collection efficiency and a reduction of 42% in the cut-off particle size with a nearly 36% increase in pressure drop value were observed (a high-efficiency model).},

ABSTRACT = {Experimental and finite element studies of the rotary friction welding (RFW) process of tungsten heavy alloy (THA) with aluminium alloy 5XXX series are presented. A 2.5D torsion simulation model including the circumferential effects was developed in this study. The temperature distributions, effective stress, flash dimensions and axial shortening were calculated on un-rotated friction welding aluminium parts. The peak temperatures were measured both in the axis and at the half-radius of the specimen. The maximum interface temperature of 581 °C for the friction weld was below the melting temperature of the aluminium alloy. The experimental and numerical results of the temperature and final weld geometries show good agreement between them. The results indicate very small deviations of 4.45%, 2.96%, and 2.34% on the flash width, flash height and axial shortening of friction welds.},

ABSTRACT = {The paper proposes a rapid, straightforward, and inexpensive method for finding the basic parameters of helical gears with an involute profile. The basic parameters envisaged are the normal module, normal profile shift coefficient, and the helix angle. The proposed method uses balls introduced between the teeth and, thus, the contact with the measuring device surfaces is of the point type, and the centres of the balls are positioned symmetrically with respect to the measuring direction. The condition that the centre of the ball occupies an imposed position is mandatory. Additionally, there is the condition of the positions of the contact points between the balls and the flanks of the teeth. Two sets of balls of different sizes are necessary for a measurement. The conditions of the balls’ positioning lead to a system of five unknowns. The methodology of solving the system is detailed and the method is exemplified for an actual helical gear. The new proposed method is based on the distance over pins but, using balls, presents the following advantages: It can be applied equally to all gears, regardless of the odd or even number of teeth. Furthermore, the dimension to be measured is singular compared to the dimension over pins when a maximum value must be found from several measurements.},

ABSTRACT = {Triply periodic minimal surface (TPMS) structures have unique geometries and excellent mechanical properties, which have attracted much attention in many fields. However, the relationship between different filling forms and different directions of functionally graded TPMS structures on energy absorption has not been fully studied. In this study, a functionally graded strategy was proposed to investigate the effect of filling form and direction gradient on the energy absorption of TPMS structures. The design of functionally graded Gyroid and Diamond TPMS cellular structures with multiple forms was characterized, and the structures were fabricated using additive manufacturing technology. The effects of uniformity and different directional gradients on the deformation and energy absorption properties of the structures were studied experimentally and numerically. According to the compression test results, it was found that different filling forms of the TPMS structure behave differently in terms of yield plateau and deformation pattern, and the sheet structures can develop a better deformation pattern to enhance energy absorption capacity. Functionally graded sheet Diamond TPMS cellular structures along the compression direction exhibit a 32% reduction in initial peak force, providing more advantages in structural deformation and energy absorption. More closely, it is possible to further reduce the initial peak force, delay the densification point, and thus increase the energy absorption capacity by designing functionally graded sheet Diamond TPMS based cellular structures. The results of this study provide valuable guidance for the design of high-performance impact-protection components.},

ABSTRACT = {In this work, the roller-shaped double V-wing honeycomb (DVWH) structure was used as the object, which was designed for forest harvesting machines. The deformation characteristics of its rotation under a specific compression were studied during the feeding process for the steel feeding roller used in the traditional combined harvesting machine for trees, which is prone to damaging the wood. The compression rate (10%–15%) and rotational speed (100 mm/s–320 mm/s) were used to analyze the relationship between compression rate, rotational speed, and deformation characteristics. The deformation characteristics, characterized by equivalent stress, radial displacement sensitivity, and energy absorption efficiency, were analyzed. The results show that the deformation characteristics of the roller-shaped DVWH structure under driven mode were more sensitive to compression rate and less sensitive to changes in rotational speed. There was a positive correlation between the equivalent stress of the node and the compression rate. The peak equivalent stress of the outermost node at 10% and 15% compression rates were 111.9 MPa and 230.9 MPa. There was a negative correlation between radial displacement–compression sensitivity and compression rate, and a decrease in radial displacement–compression sensitivity from 10% to 15% compression rate at different nodes ranges from 5% to 22%. The feed performance efficiency (EF) grew from 8.3% to 12.7% for a 1% increase in compression rate.},

ABSTRACT = {Manufacturers of hydraulic fluids invest a lot of effort and resources in improving their physico-chemical properties, with the goal of getting as close as possible to the properties of an ideal hydraulic fluid. It should be non- flammable, environmentally friendly, sustainable and should have excellent physical and chemical properties. After decades of development in the field of ionic liquids and the search for an ionic liquid suitable for use in hydraulic systems, ionic hydraulic liquids are now already in industrial use, especially on devices that operate in harsh and risky operating conditions. Since ionic hydraulic fluids are a completely new type of hydraulic fluid, one of the issues is their compatibility with the materials present in the hydraulic components, including all the seals. This paper refers to the process of testing the compatibility of hydraulic seal materials with different types of ionic hydraulic fluids according to the standardized percentages and recommendations, with emphasis on changes in the swell, shrinkage and hardness of the seals. The presented results are a useful guide for selecting suitable seal materials in case of using high-tech ionic hydraulic fluids.},

ABSTRACT = {The present paper describes a comparison of the efficiency of different types of rotors used in the refining of aluminium melt at a foundry degassing unit (FDU). Physical modelling was used to obtain data for six different rotor types under defined experimental conditions. In order to evaluate the data from the physical model, an evaluation method based on the interpolation of degassing curves was developed in such a way that the resulting characteristic can be expressed by a single parameter. Using the new methodology, the datasets were replaced by a single dimensionless parameter, a, which characterizes the rotor performance at a given gas flow rate. Based on the comparison of these performance parameters, it was possible to mutually compare the rotor efficiency depending on the selected conditions. The comparison is also demonstrated on the expected degassing time to a certain required concentration. Based on the physical model results, the study found that rotor D had the highest degassing efficiency, followed by rotors F and A. Rotors B and E had similar efficiency at a flow rate of 17 Nl·min−1. However, rotor B showed better efficiency at higher inert gas flow rates (19 and 21 Nl·min−1), while rotor E showed better efficiency at lower flow rates (13 and 15 Nl·min−1).},

ABSTRACT = {As an integral part of a machine, gears are subject to wear, which is influenced by a number of factors. For polymer gears in particular, the uncertainties due to wear are high. These uncertainties outweigh the advantages of polymer gears, such as lower inertia. Improved condition monitoring, for example, with better data acquisition, could reduce these uncertainties and is therefore of great interest. This study addresses the challenges of condition monitoring in polymer gears by investigating the integration of sensors directly onto the gears for improved sensitivity. A compact sensor module mounted on a polymer gear is presented to demonstrate the benefits of integrated sensors. The research compares the effectiveness of integrated acceleration and temperature sensors with state of the art external methods. The results show that the in situ sensor module (ISM) provides reliable measurements for condition monitoring with integrated sensors. A comparative analysis with methods based on the current state of research highlights the increased sensitivity of condition monitoring based on the ISM acceleration sensors compared to traditional bearing block sensors. This increased sensitivity shows a clear advantage of integrated sensors over established methods. The temperature curve of the integrated sensors is sensitive to abrasive wear and gear failure, indicating the wider potential of integrated temperature sensors. In conclusion, this research lays the foundation for advanced condition monitoring using integrated sensors in polymer gears. The knowledge gained contributes to optimising gear applications, promoting cost-effectiveness and aligning with the principles of the Internet of Things and Industry 4.0.},

ABSTRACT = {The process of tube nosing is a delicate art that involves forming the end of a tubular part without causing any collapse, buckling, or wrinkling. A recent study has delved into the different modes of failure that can occur during this process and has determined the limits of tube nosing through the use of plasticity and thin/thick-walled tube theories. A finite element simulation was developed to replicate the cold-nosing process using conical dies to validate these theories. The results were compared to experimental outcomes for mild steel, hard steel, and annealed aluminium tubes to ensure accuracy. Through this analysis, we identified and confirmed the modes of failure that can restrict the plastic deformation for the tube nosing process. The outcomes were compared to analytical expressions and showed excellent agreement with the experiments, proving that these expressions provide a reliable reference guide for predicting the limits of the tube-nosing process. The FE simulation method also accurately models critical buckling stresses, nosing loads, and failure modes.},

ABSTRACT = {Pressure vessels having the structure of a cylindrical shell with a tangential nozzle are often used in engineering for some process requirements. But there are no accurate methods in engineering codes for the strength design of this special structure. In this paper, the limit–load analysis was performed to evaluate the weakening effects of the tangential nozzles on the strength of the cylindrical shells under internal pressure. A so-called strength–weakening coefficient was defined to reflect the weakening degree of the load-bearing capacity of the cylindrical shells by the tangential nozzles or specifically by the three dimensionless structural parameters, namely diameter ratio (do/Di), diameter-thickness ratio (Di/T) and thickness ratio (t/T). Results show that when increasing do/Di and Di/T or decreasing t/T, the strength–weakening coefficient increases, which means that the strength–weakening effect of the tangential nozzle on the cylindrical shell increases. With sufficient simulation results, regression equations for the strength–weakening coefficient were obtained which provides a reference for the strength design of cylindrical shells with tangential nozzles under internal pressure.},

ABSTRACT = {The rapid growth of the elderly population has led to an increased demand for effective and personalized eldercare solutions. In this paper, the design and development of an eldercare robot is presented. This robot is specifically tailored to meet the two specific challenges faced by the elderly. The first is the continuous indoor tracking of the elder, while the second is the fall detection. A comprehensive overview of the hardware and software components, as well as the control architecture of the robot is presented. The hardware design of the robot incorporates a range of features, including a perception system comprising a 2D Lidar, IMU, and camera for environment mapping, localization, and fall detection. The software stack of the robot is explained as consisting of layers for perception, mapping, and localization. The robot is tested experimentally to validate its path planning capability by using Hector SLAM and the RRT* technique. Experimental path planning has shown a positioning accuracy of 93.8% on average. Elderly fall detection is achieved by using the YOLOv7 algorithm at a percentage of 96%. Experimental results have been discussed and evaluated.},

ABSTRACT = {In this article, an analytical solution to a hydraulic network with a wide range of pipe lengths (up to 10 km) is proposed. The Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) method was applied with the aim of creating a regulation model for controlling both the flow rate of water from one of the two sources and the discharge pressure in the system. The system inertia requires an understanding of boundary conditions in the operation of pipeline networks, which must be known in order to regulate the required parameters with only minor deviations. The proposed model was compared to experimental data, while the mean absolute deviations in the individual system branches ranged from 1 to 5.19%. The created regulation model was subsequently tested by applying linear, sine and stochastic changes in the output load, while the ability to control the discharge pressure and the selected water flow rate was analysed. The effect of coefficient ε, which multiplies the effect of the difference between the measured and the predicted value of the discharge pressure on the boundary conditions of the discharge pressure in the system, was analysed in this paper. With the use of the proposed unsteady simulation of the fluid flow in the hydraulic system arranged in parallel and in series, the maximum deviation of the regulated pressure was 1.2% and the maximum deviation of the regulated flow rate was 5.3%.},

ABSTRACT = {The dynamics of metastructures, incorporating both conventional and internally coupled resonators, are investigated to enhance vibration suppression capabilities through a novel mathematical framework. A close-form formulation and a transfer function methodology are introduced, integrating control system theory with metastructure analysis, offering new insights into the role of internal coupling. The findings reveal that precise internal coupling, when matched exactly to the stiffness of the resonator, enables the clear formation of secondary bandgaps, significantly influencing the vibration isolation efficacy of the metastructure. Although the study primarily focuses on theoretical and numerical analyses, the implications of adjusting mass distribution on resonators are also explored. This formulation methodology enables the adjustment of bandgap characteristics, underscoring the potential for adaptive control over bandgaps in metastructures. Such capabilities are crucial for tailoring the vibration isolation and energy harvesting functionalities in mechanically resonant systems, especially when applied to demanding heavy-duty applications.},

ABSTRACT = {The precise control of an aerial manipulator presents a formidable challenge due to the inherent mobility of its base, which is subject to both external disturbances and dynamic disturbances due to manipulator motions. In this paper, we introduce two Closed-Loop Inverse Kinematics (CLIK) control algorithms tailored to aerial manipulators. The first algorithm operates at the velocity level and uses the Generalized Jacobian for inverse kinematics, while the second one operates at the acceleration level. We evaluate their performance in a simulated environment, replicating real-world challenges such as the wind effect, sensors noise, uncertainty of the system inertial parameters, and impulsive forces at the end-effector. Trajectory tracking simulated experiments are carried out for a two- and three-degree-of-freedom (DOF) aerial manipulator tracking a circular trajectory with its end-effector. Both algorithms demonstrate promising results in coping with external disturbances and variations in the inertial parameters, enhancing the precision of the trajectory tracking control. The acceleration-level algorithm shows overall better performance compared to the velocity-level one in the face of greater implementation complexity and computational burden.},

ABSTRACT = {This study introduces a reduced-order leg dynamic model to simplify the controller design and enhance robustness. The proposed multi-loop control scheme tackles tracking control issues in legged robots, including joint angle and contact-force regulation, disturbance suppression, measurement delay, and motor saturation avoidance. Firstly, model predictive control (MPC) and sliding mode control (SMC) schemes are developed using a simplified model, and their stability is analyzed using the Lyapunov method. Numerical simulations under two disturbances validate the superior tracking performance of the SMC scheme. Secondly, an Nth-order linear active disturbance rejection control (LADRC) is designed based on a simplified model and optimization problems. The second-order LADRC-SMC scheme reduces the contact-force control error in the SMC scheme by ten times. Finally, a fourth-order LADRC-SMC with a Smith Predictor (LADRC-SMC-SP) scheme is formulated, employing each loop controller independently. This scheme simplifies the design and enhances performance. Compared to numerical simulations of the above and existing schemes, the LADRC-SMC-SP scheme eliminates delay oscillations, shortens convergence time, and demonstrates fast force-position tracking responses, minimal overshoot, and strong disturbance rejection. The peak contact-force error in the LADRC-SMC-SP scheme was ten times smaller than that in the LADRC-SMC scheme. The integral square error (ISE) values for the tracking errors of joint angles θ1 and θ2, and contact force f, are 1.6636×10−28 rad2⋅s, 1.7983×10−28 rad2⋅s, and 1.8062×10−30 N2⋅s, respectively. These significant improvements in control performance address the challenges in single-leg dynamic systems, effectively handling disturbances, delays, and motor saturation.},

ABSTRACT = {Because the gearbox in transmission systems is prone to failure and the fault signal is not obvious, the fault end cannot be located. In this paper, a gearbox fault diagnosis method grounded on improved complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise, a multiscale permutation entropy and adaptive wavelet thresholding (ICEEMDAN-MPE-AWT) denoising method and an SE-ResNeXt50 transfer learning model are proposed. Initially, the vibration signal is denoised by ICEEMDAN-MPE-AWT, the denoised vibration signal is then converted into a Gram angle field (GAF) diagram, and then the parameters are transferred by the fine-tuning transfer learning strategy. Finally, a GAF diagram is input into the model for training to achieve fault extraction and classification. In this paper, the open gear dataset of Southeast University is used for experimental research. The experimental results show that when using the ICEEMDAN-MPE-AWT and when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the experimental data is −4 dB, the average accuracy of the GASF+TSE-ResNeXt50 and the GASF+TSE-ResNeXt18 can reach 98.8% and 97.5%, respectively. When the SNR is 6 dB, the accuracy of the above two models reaches 100% and 99.3%, respectively. Moreover, when compared to alternative approaches, the noise reduction method in this paper can better remove noise interference so that the model can better extract fault features. Therefore, the method proposed in this article shows significant improvement in noise reduction and fault classification accuracy compared to other methods.},

ABSTRACT = {Engine mounts serve three primary purposes: (1) to support the weight of the engine, (2) to lessen the transmitted engine disturbance forces to the vehicle structure/chassis or airplane fuselage, and (3) to limit the engine motion brought on by shock excitations. The engine mount’s stiffness must be high to control large engine motions and low to control chassis or vehicle body vibration. When hydraulic engine mounts are used, a device called a decoupler creates the dual stiffness requirement. However, numerous investigations have shown that the decoupler has the potential to rotate within its cage bound and become stuck or sink and obstruct fluid flow between the fluid chambers due to a density mismatch between the decoupler and the working fluid. In addition, most hydraulic engine mounts with a decoupler no longer act as vibration isolators but as hydraulic dampers. This study suggests a new amplitude-sensitive hydraulic engine mount design without a decoupler, where the vibration isolation of the engine mount is retained and there is a 75% reduction in the peak frequency, which further enhances the engine mount’s capabilities in comparison to the current hydraulic engine mounts with a decoupler. The new design concept and its mathematical model and simulation results will be presented.},

ABSTRACT = {Seafarers’ unsafe acts as the direct causes of maritime accidents are considered to be the result of the interaction between complex and dynamic influencing factors. Identifying the risk evolution characteristics and paths of seafarers’ unsafe acts has always been a challenge in maritime safety management. For this purpose, the present study introduces association rule technique into complex network to develop a directed weighted interaction network of seafarers’ unsafe acts and their influencing factors. Through global network topology analysis and local network community detection, the risk evolution characteristics of seafarers’ unsafe acts in maritime accidents are analyzed from a multidimensional perspective. The results indicate that the developed network has small-world characteristics, and the top 10 critical nodes all belong to seafarers’ unsafe acts, of which failure to make proper sound and light signals achieves the highest PageRank value. Results from this study would help maritime stakeholders to understand the evolution mechanism of seafarers’ unsafe acts and develop safety management strategies for interrupting the risk propagation of seafarers’ unsafe acts.},

ABSTRACT = {This study examines the optimization of ore receiving bins in underground copper mines, targeting the reduction of rapid wear and tear on bin components. The investigation identifies the primary wear contributors as the force exerted by the accumulated ore and the velocity at which ore particles move. By altering design and operational parameters, the objective is to decrease wear at key points such as transfer areas, thereby improving the efficiency and service life of retention bunkers. A Discrete Element Method (DEM) model of the bin was created and validated against actual mining conditions to study the impact of material flow on wear. The optimization approach used a constrained gradient descent algorithm to minimize factors like particle velocity and pressure force, while maintaining the efficiency of the bin. The findings provide valuable insights for the future design enhancements, potentially improving the operational performance of retention bunkers in the mining industry.},

ABSTRACT = {In order to solve the problem of low response frequency and poor consistency of conventional yarn grippers in weft accumulators, in this study, a piezoelectric yarn gripper is used instead of conventional yarn grippers and the motion characteristics of its actuator are studied. This gripper uses a bimorph piezoelectric bending actuator with a low-cost, well integrated self-sensing method based on charge measurement. The modeling of the piezoelectric micromanipulator is based on the piezoelectric and Euler–Bernoulli beam equations. The static and dynamic characteristics of the piezoelectric actuator as well as the self-sensing capability were experimentally tested. The experimental results show that the maximum output displacement at the end of the piezoelectric actuator is 834 μm, and the maximum output force is 388 μN at 150 V driving voltage. The stability and consistency of its response are also very good, with a response speed of 24 ms. The self-sensing test of the output force also proved the feasibility of the self-sensing method used, with an error of 0.74%. The piezoelectric yarn gripper studied in this paper is promising for practical clamping applications.},

ABSTRACT = {To solve the problem that noise seriously affects the online monitoring of parts signals of outdoor machinery, this paper proposes a signal reconstruction method integrating deep neural network and compression sensing, called ADMM-1DNet, and gives a detailed online vibration signal monitoring scheme. The basic approach of the ADMM-1DNet network is to map the update steps of the classical Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) into the deep network architecture with a fixed number of layers, and each phase corresponds to an iteration in the traditional ADMM. At the same time, what differs from other unfolded networks is that ADMM-1DNet learns a redundant analysis operator, which can reduce the impact of outdoor high noise on reconstruction error by improving the signal sparse level. The implementation scheme includes the field operation of mechanical equipment and the operation of the data center. The empirical network trained by the local data center conducts an online reconstruction of the received outdoor vibration signal data. Experiments are conducted on two open-source bearing datasets, which verify that the proposed method outperforms the baseline method in terms of reconstruction accuracy and feature preservation, and the proposed implementation scheme can be adapted to the needs of different types of vibration signal reconstruction tasks.},

ABSTRACT = {The computer numerically controlled (CNC) system is the key functional component of CNC machine tool control systems, and the servo drive system is an important part of CNC systems. The complex working environment will lead to frequent failure of servo drive systems. Taking effective health management measures is the key to ensure the normal operation of CNC machine tools. In this paper, the comprehensive effect of fault prediction and fault diagnosis is considered for the first time, and a health management system for machine tool servo drive systems is proposed and applied to operation and maintenance management. According to the data collected by the system and related indicators, the technology can predict the state trend of equipment operation, identify the hidden fault characteristics in the data, and further diagnose the fault types. A health management system mainly includes fault prediction and fault diagnosis. The core of fault prediction is the gated recurrent unit (GRU). The attention mechanism is introduced into a GRU neural network, which can solve the long-term dependence problem and improve the model performance. At the same time, the Nadam optimizer is used to update the model parameters, which improves the convergence speed and generalization ability of the model and makes it suitable for solving the prediction problem of large-scale data. The core of fault diagnosis is the self-organizing mapping (SOM) neural network, which performs cluster analysis on data with different characteristics, to realize fault diagnosis. In addition, feature standardization and principal component analysis (PCA) are introduced to balance the influence of different feature scales, enhance the feature of fault data, and achieve data dimensionality reduction. Compared with the other two algorithms and their improved versions, the superiority of the health management system with high-dimensional data and the enhancement effect of fault identification are verified. The relative relationship between fault prediction and diagnosis is further revealed, and the adjustment idea of the production plan is provided for decision makers. The rationality and effectiveness of the system in practical application are verified by a series of tests of fault data sets.},

The physical model is a large machine with a height of 34 m and a width of 77 m, and due to its complexity, a simplified model was used. This study aims to investigate the influence of wind speed on the stability failure of the reclaimer and to provide a more efficient and precise stopping criterion. The simulations were performed using a two-way FSI (fluid–structure interaction) approach. An FSI analysis was performed to study the dynamic behavior of a numerical model consisting of two separate parts with contact constraints. This article also highlights the importance of FSI in improving the reliability of the stability failure. Finally, the numerical results showed differences compared to the analytical model, and the wind load limit to stability failure was observed at higher wind speeds. The structure was able to support wind velocities higher than suggested by the FEM (European Materials Handling Federation) standard without stability fails.},

ABSTRACT = {In order to improve the accuracy of bearing fault diagnosis under a small sample, variable load, and noise conditions, a new fault diagnosis method based on an image information fusion and Vision Transformer (ViT) transfer learning model is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the method applies continuous wavelet transform (CWT), Gramian angular summation field (GASF), and Gramian angular difference field (GADF) to the time series data, and generates three grayscale images. Then, the generated three grayscale images are merged into an information fusion image (IFI) using image processing techniques. Finally, the obtained IFIs are fed into the advanced ViT model and trained based on transfer learning. In order to verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method, the rolling bearing dataset from Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) is used to carry out experimental studies under different working conditions. Experimental results show that the method proposed in this paper is superior to other traditional methods in terms of accuracy, and the effect of ViT model based on transfer learning (TLViT) training is better than that of the Resnet50 model based on transfer learning training (TLResnet50) under variable loads and small sample conditions. In addition, the experimental results also prove that the IFI with multiple image information has better anti-noise ability than the single information image. Therefore, the method proposed in this paper can improve the accuracy of bearing fault diagnosis under small sample, variable load and noise conditions, and provide a new method for bearing fault diagnosis.},

The oxidation performance, friction performance and rheological properties of lubricating grease were tested and compared to those of fresh grease to analyze and summarize the performance changes in lubricating grease. The transmission efficiency, friction torque, and temperature rise of ball screws without removing the original grease and those filled with fresh grease after cleaning were tested and compared. The impact of grease degradation on the transmission performance of ball screws was analyzed to provide a reference for ball screw lubrication schemes and further accelerated storage experimental design.},

ABSTRACT = {In the present study, a thorough examination of nanoindentation-based mechanical properties of a refractory MoTaNbVW high-entropy alloy (RHEA) was conducted. Basic mechanical properties, such as the indentation modulus of elasticity, indentation hardness, and indentation-absorbed elastic energy, were assessed by means of different input testing variables, such as the loading speed and indentation depth. The obtained results were discussed in terms of the elasto-plastic behavior of the affected material by the indentation process and material volume. Detailed analysis of the RHEA alloy’s nanoindentation creep behavior was also assessed. The effect of testing parameters such as preset indentation depth, loading speed, and holding—at the creep stage—time were selected for their impact. The results were explained in terms of the availability of mobile dislocations to accommodate creep deformation. Crucial parameters, such as maximum shear stress developed during testing (τmax), critical volume for dislocation nucleation (Vcr), and creep deformation stress exponent n, were taken into consideration to explain the observed behavior. Additionally, in all cases of mechanical property examination and in order to identify those input testing parameters—in case—that have the most severe effect, an extensive statistical analysis was conducted using four different methods, namely ANOVA, correlation matrix analysis, Random Forest analysis, and Partial Dependence Plots. It was observed that in most of the cases, the statistical treatment of the obtained testing data was in agreement with the microstructural and metallurgical observations and postulates.},

ABSTRACT = {Flying cars offer huge advantages due to their deformable structure, which can adapt to external environments and mission requirements. They represent a novel system that can realize vertical takeoff and landing. However, the structure of a flying car is complicated, placing higher requirements on modeling accuracy and control effectiveness. Thus, in this paper, a dynamic model of a flying car is proposed by combining a car body, motor, and propellers. Then, a double-loop controller based on active disturbance rejection control is proposed to accurately control its flight altitude. Utilizing the extended state observer, external wind and other disturbances are regarded as an extended state, which can be dynamically observed and compensated to significantly improve tracking accuracy. The effectiveness of the proposed controller is validated through detailed simulations and flight experiments. The proposed controller significantly improves control accuracy and disturbance rejection capability.},

ABSTRACT = {To investigate the mechanism of flow-induced vibrations in the cooling system of a double crystal monochromator (DCM), this paper utilizes a multi-physics numerical simulation approach, employing ANSYS and FLUENT platforms to simulate the flow state of liquid nitrogen in the cooling system and explore the amplitude response of the DCM. Initially, simulations were conducted to examine the flow state of liquid nitrogen with varying frequency and amplitude pulsations. Subsequently, modal analysis was employed to investigate the amplitude response of the DCM in the pitch direction vibrations under pulsating excitation. Finally, this research investigated the influence of high heat load-induced liquid nitrogen boiling on a DCM. The results indicate that pipe resistance is the fundamental cause of vibration induced by pulsating excitation. Low-frequency excitation enhances the amplification factor of DCM vibration. In contrast, due to the rapid conversion of fluid kinetic energy to pressure potential energy, high-frequency excitation increases the pulsation amplitude in the pipe. Additionally, there is a linear relationship between the amplitude of liquid nitrogen velocity fluctuations and the response amplitude of a DCM. The slug flow formed after liquid nitrogen boiling generates low-frequency pulse signals, and intermittent fluid impacts cause significant vibrations in the DCM. These research findings provide a reference for the analysis and design of ultra-high-stability DCM cooling systems.},

ABSTRACT = {Aircraft icing has historically been a critical cause of airplane crashes. The electro-impulse de-icing system has a wide range of applications in aircraft de-icing due to its lightweight design, low energy consumption, high efficiency, and other advantages. However, there has been little study into accurate wing electric-impulse de-icing simulation methods and the parameters impacting de-icing efficacy. Based on the damage mechanics principle and considering the influence mechanisms of interface debonding and ice fracture on ice shedding, this paper establishes a more accurate numerical model of wing electric-impulse de-icing using the Cohesive Zone Model (CZM). It simulates the process of electric-impulse de-icing at the leading edge of the NACA 0012 wing. The numerical results are compared to the experimental results, revealing that the constructed wing electro-impulse de-icing numerical model is superior. Lastly, the effects of varying ice–skin interface shear adhesion strengths, doubler loading positions, and impulse sequences on de-icing effectiveness were studied. The de-icing rate is a quantitative description of the electro-impulse’s de-icing action, defined in the numerical model as the ratio of cohesive element deletions to the total elements at the ice–skin interface. The findings reveal that varying shear adhesion strengths at the ice–skin interface significantly impact the de-icing effect. The de-icing rate steadily falls with increasing shear adhesion strength, from 66% to 56%. When two, four, and seven impulses were applied to doubler two, the de-icing rates were 59%, 71%, and 71%, respectively, significantly increasing the de-icing efficiency compared to when impulses were applied to doubler one. Doubler one and two impulse responses are overlaid differently depending on the impulse sequences, resulting in varying de-icing rates. When the impulse sequence is 20 ms, the superposition results are optimal, and the de-icing rate reaches 100%. These studies can guide the development and implementation of a wing electric-impulse de-icing system.},

ABSTRACT = {Reconfigurable manufacturing systems (RMSs) are extensively studied and employed to address demand uncertainties. RMS machines are designed to be modular and adaptable to changing requirements. A recent innovation is the introduction of multi-spindle reconfigurable machines (MRMTs). This study evaluates the impact of MRMTs’ introduction into an RMS, considering factors such as the number of MRMT machines and reconfiguration policies. A simulation model incorporating failures, process time variability, and part inter-arrival supports the analysis. The numerical results aid decision makers in determining the optimal RMS configuration with MRMTs. The simulation outcomes indicate that a balanced number of multi-spindle machines can significantly enhance performance compared with an unbalanced distribution.},

ABSTRACT = {Rapid heating of the mold surface is necessary for the high-gloss, high-productivity injection molding process. A rapid heating mold system that uses a carbon nanotube (CNT) as a heating element was investigated because of its structure. For CNT web film to be utilized in the injection molding process, heating must be applied inside the mold. That can cause poor contact at the contact area between the mold and the CNT heating element, leading to local temperature deviation and resistance changes that reduce the heating stability of the CNT surface element. Additionally, the multilayer structure of the CNT web film can cause heat-transfer performance variations due to the different layer thicknesses. To address these issues, an adjustable flush was constructed at the contact area between the electrode inside the mold and the insulator to analyze the heating behavior of the CNT heating element as a function of dimensional deviation. The thermal durability of the CNT web film was also evaluated by analyzing the Raman spectra and measuring resistance changes caused by local overheating. The film can withstand high temperatures, with a flush limit value of 0.3 mm. An optimization analysis was conducted to determine the ideal thicknesses of the multilayer CNT web film, insulator, and electrical insulator. Optimal layer thicknesses were found to be 10 μm, 5 mm, and 0.5 mm, respectively. The main variables of the rapid heating mold required for application to the injection process were identified and reflected in the mold design to suggest directions for commercialization.},

By adjusting the friction coefficient, the initial speed of the rotor, and other parameters, the movement process of the rotor falling in the protection bearing was studied. By comparing the speed fluctuation and contact force of the rotor and the bearing inner race, the influencing factors and rules of the impact of the rotor falling on the protection bearing were analyzed and summarized.},

ABSTRACT = {The valve-controlled cylinder drive system is the most common type among hydraulic applications. Nonlinear behaviour in such systems is inevitable when the valve spool is around its null position. We utilised the component linking method to investigate the nonlinearities in a Moog valve-controlled asymmetric cylinder drive system by simulation in Fortran, in which a generalised concept is introduced and validated by comparing to the experimental results. An X factor is proposed in the generalised concept to describe the asymmetric cylinder state, which is a constant when the cylinder is extending or retracting, but numerically calculated when the valve spool is in the underlap region. This analytical solution is approximately 200 times more computationally efficient than the numerical solution method. This paper utilises the component linking method to simulate the Moog valve-controlled asymmetric cylinder drive system in Matlab Simulink, and proposes an analytical solution for the X factor when the valve spool is in the underlap region. This analytical solution is approximately 200 times more computationally efficient than the numerical solution method.},

ABSTRACT = {The use of electric drives and energy storage devices in vehicles presents fresh challenges for system designers. Among these is addressing the susceptibility of battery packs to mechanical vibrations, necessitating vibration testing. In failure scenarios, like a battery fire, swiftly detaching the battery pack from the vibration platform is vital. It is also essential to ensure that the mounting system—fixture and fastener—effectively transfers vibration between the exciter and the battery pack. The article discusses the basic requirements for the fixture of specimens subjected to vibration testing and fastening it to a slip table of head expander, giving a better understanding of its role. It then presents the results of a theoretical analysis of the fixing forces and their laboratory testing using prototype customized fastening solutions with potential for use in vibration testing. The results of the conducted research and analyses demonstrate that non-standard mounting techniques have limited potential to replace screw mountings in vibration testing, particularly as fully universal techniques. However, the generated mounting forces, with potential resulting from the possibility of tailored implementation of the tested mounting techniques in the design of tables or head expanders, appropriately designed, justify further research work in this area.},

ABSTRACT = {The primary objective of the study was development of a machine learning (ML)-based workflow for fracture hit (“frac hit”) detection and monitoring using shale oil-field data such as drilling surveys, production history (oil and produced water), pressure, and fracking start time and duration records. The ML method takes advantage of long short-term memory (LSTM) and multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural networks to identify the frac hits due to hydraulic communication between the fracking child well(s) and the producing parent well(s) within the same pad (intra-pad interaction) and/or on different pads (inter-pad interaction). It utilizes time series of pressure and production data from within a pad and from adjacent pads. The workflow can capture time variable features of frac hits when the model architecture is deep and wide enough, with enough trainable parameters for deep learning and feature extraction, as demonstrated in this paper by using training and testing subsets of the field data from selected neighboring pads with over a couple of hundred wells. The study was focused on frac-hit interaction among paired wells and demonstrated that the ML model, once trained, can predict the frac-hit probability.},

ABSTRACT = {Lamb-wave-based structural health monitoring is widely acknowledged as a reliable method for damage identification, classification, localization and quantification. However, due to the complexity of Lamb wave signals, especially after interacting with structural components and defects, interpreting these waves and extracting useful information about the structure’s health is still a major challenge. Deep-learning-based strategy offers a great opportunity to address such challenges as the algorithm can operate directly on raw discrete time-domain signals. Unlike traditional methods, which often require careful feature engineering and preprocessing, deep learning can automatically extract relevant features from the raw data. This paper proposes an autoencoder based on a bidirectional long short-term memory network (Bi-LSTM) with maximal overlap discrete wavelet transform (MODWT). layer to detect the signal anomaly and determine the location of the damage in the composite structure. MODWT decomposes the signal into multiple levels of detail with different frequency resolution, capturing both temporal and spectral features simultaneously. Comparing with vanilla Bi-LSTM, this approach enables the model to greatly enhance its ability to detect and locate structural damage in structures, thereby increasing safety and efficiency.},

ABSTRACT = {This article shows the effect of the addition of effective microorganisms and silver on the exhaust gas composition and fuel consumption. Exhaust emission standards are becoming increasingly stringent, which makes it difficult for engine manufacturers to meet them. For this reason, intensive work is underway to use alternative propulsion systems on ships, and for diesel engines, alternative fuels. Among other things, this applies to mixtures of petroleum-based fuels with vegetable oils and their esters. Unfortunately, their use, due to their physicochemical properties, can negatively affect the performance of the engine and the wear of its components. Therefore, the aim of this study was to see how additives of effective microorganisms in the form of ceramic liquid and tubes, and a silver solution and colloidal silver would affect some engine parameters, including the exhaust gas composition and fuel consumption. The authors are not aware of the results of previous research on this issue. The tests were carried out on a diesel engine for four types of green additives at concentrations of 2% and 5%, at different ranges of its load. The additives added to the diesel fuel were characterised, and the test stand was presented, along with the parameters of the tested fuel. The effect of additives on selected engine parameters, including fuel consumption, was presented. The characteristics of hourly fuel consumption and selected components of the exhaust gas, including nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide as a function of the concentration of ecological additives are shown and analysed. It was found that the most beneficial additive that had a positive effect on the exhaust gas composition and fuel consumption was a silver solution in a 2% concentration. There was a decrease of up to 4% in the NOx content of the exhaust gas, a decrease in carbon monoxide of more than 28%, a decrease in carbon dioxide of 4.6% and a decrease in fuel consumption of around 3% was achieved under the tested conditions. The use of these additives is an innovative solution that has a positive impact on reducing the emissions of harmful compounds into the atmosphere. In further research, it will be necessary to study the effect of this additive on the combustion process in the engine and the wear of its components, as well as to confirm the results obtained in real operating conditions.},

ABSTRACT = {This article presents the conceptual design, operation principle, dynamic modeling, and simulation results of a discrete incremental hydraulic positioning system (DIHPS) intended for use in high-precision, heavy-load industrial automation solutions. An original solution for precise incremental step positioning using DIHPS is proposed, comprising an n-step linear double-acting hydraulic actuator (HA) with a double rod, cylinder sleeve with outflow gaps, binary valves (BVs) bleed-off into the tank, and fixed throttle valves (TRVs) at the inlets of the actuator chambers. The discrete incremental shift of the HA is determined by controlling the opening and closing of the individual BVs, and the step shift of the HA piston stops at the opening location of the BV. A dynamic model of incremental step shift for DIHPS is developed, considering the behavior and relationships of its individual elements. A dynamic model of HA with and without a hydropneumatic accumulator (HPA) is presented. HPA has been shown to effectively dampen piston vibrations and pressure peaks at the HA stop position. The design assumptions, dynamic models, and discrete incremental positioning of the DIHPS are verified by simulation tests and assessed with quantitative indicators. Innovative DIHPSs have significant practical potential in the discrete incremental positioning of heavy loads.},

ABSTRACT = {The main goal of this work is to combine the usage of the numerical homogenization technique for determining the effective properties of representative volume elements with artificial neural networks. The effective properties are defined according to the classical laminate theory. The purpose is to create and train a rapid surrogate model for the quick calculation of the mechanical properties of hollow concrete slabs. First, the homogenization algorithm was implemented, which determines membrane, bending and transverse shearing properties of a given parametrized hollow-core precast slab reinforced with steel bars. The algorithm uses the finite element mesh but does not require a formal solution of the finite element method problem. Second, the learning and training artificial intelligence framework was created and fed with a dataset obtained by optimal Latin hypercube sampling. In the study, a multilayer perceptron type of artificial neural network was used. This allows for obtaining rapid calculations of the effective properties of a particular hollow-core precast slab by using a surrogate model. In the paper, it has been proven that such a model, obtained via complex numerical calculations, gives a very accurate estimation of the properties and can be used in many practical tasks, such as optimization problems or computer-aided design decisions. Above all, the efficient setup of the artificial neural network has been sought and presented.},

ABSTRACT = {Polypropylene is a widely used linear hydrocarbon polymer with diverse applications due to its exceptional physicochemical characteristics and minimal changes during the recycling process. Numerous studies have focused on factors influencing the mechanical properties of polypropylene and its application in composites. However, despite their significance in the agricultural industry, there is limited research on polypropylene baling twines. This study analyses the behaviour of polypropylene baling twine under tensile loading, exploring the influence of fibre friction and twisting angle on the material’s tensile strength. Experimental investigation indicated that tensile strength increases with twisting angle, but only until the angle reaches a critical value. Further increase in the twist angle led to a decrease in tensile strength. The increase in tensile strength is attributed to the rise in the coefficient of friction between fibres in the twine. An experimental approach was employed to evaluate the mechanical characteristics of the twine, including the effect of prestressing by twisting. Understanding these characteristics is crucial for enhancing the quality of polypropylene baling twines and optimising their application in the agricultural industry.},

Meanwhile, the prognostic aspect utilizes AdaBoost regressors, also acting as weak learners trained on the same features, to predict the machine’s future state and estimate its remaining useful life. A key contribution of this approach is its ability to address the challenge of limited historical data for electrical equipment by optimizing AdaBoost parameters with minimal data. Experimental validation is conducted using a dedicated setup to collect comprehensive data. Through illustrative examples using experimental data, the efficacy of this method in identifying malfunctions and precisely forecasting the remaining lifespan of DC motors is demonstrated.},

ABSTRACT = {Mechanical interfaces are prevalent in industries like aerospace and maritime, where the normal contact stiffness on these surfaces is a crucial component of the overall stiffness of mechanical structures. From the perspective of structural mechanics, normal contact stiffness significantly affects the dynamic response of mechanical structures and must be considered in mechanical design and simulation analysis. Essentially, the mechanical interface represents a typical type of nonlinear contact, characterized by both its non-uniform distribution and its frequency-dependent properties under external excitations. A plate structure was designed to study the distribution and frequency-dependent characteristics of normal contact stiffness on the mechanical interface. Experiments validated that the normal contact stiffness not only significantly increases the fundamental frequency of the plate but also alters its mode shapes. To replicate the experimental results in simulations, the BUSH elements were used to model the normal contact stiffness within the plate structure, arranging it non-uniformly and setting it to vary with frequency according to the plate’s mode shapes and frequency response. This method accurately replicated the plate’s mode shapes and response curves within the 0–1000 Hz range in simulations.},

ABSTRACT = {Limiting the suspension stroke in vehicles holds critical and conceivable benefits. It is crucial for the safety, stability, ride comfort, and overall performance of the vehicle. Furthermore, it improves the reliability of suspension components and maintains consistent handling during regular and rough driving conditions. Hence, the design of a safety-critical controller to limit the suspension stroke for active suspension systems is of high importance. In this study, we employed a quarter-car model that incorporates a suspension spring with cubic nonlinearity. The proposed safety-critical controller is the control Lyapunov function–control barrier function–quadratic programming (CLF-CBF-QP). Initially, we designed the reference controller as a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) controller based on the linearized quarter-car model. The reference state-feedback LQR controller simplified the design of the control Lyapunov function. Consequently, from the nonlinear model, we construct a simple control Lyapunov function that relies only on the sprung mass velocity to have a relative degree of one. The CLF intends to improve the performance by considering the nonlinearity and via online optimization. We then formulate the control barrier function to restrict the suspension stroke from breaching its limits. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed controller, we present two challenging road inputs for the nonlinear quarter-car model when employing CLF-CBF-QP and LQR controllers. The CLF-CBF-QP findings surpassed the LQR controller in terms of safety and performance. This study highlights the immense potential of CLF-CBF-QP for suspension systems, improving the time-domain performance, limiting the suspension stroke, and guaranteeing safety.},

ABSTRACT = {(1) Objectives: This article presents a dual linear-motor differential drive micro-feed servo system, mainly through the optimization design of the transmission mechanism. Owing to the differential synthesis of the micro feed from the upper and under linear motors, the impact of friction nonlinearity during the ultra-low velocity micro feed is avoided, endowing the system with a lower stable feed speed to achieve precise micro-feed control. (2) Methods: Transmission components of the dual linear-motor differential-drive system are analyzed using the lumped parameter method, and a dynamic model of electromechanical coupling is created, which takes into account nonlinear friction. The motion relationship of the dual linear-motor differential-drive servo feed system is characterized using a transfer function block diagram. (3) Discussions: Through simulation, the differences in response between the linear-motor single-drive system and the dual linear-motor differential-drive system are examined under fixed or variable feeding velocities as well as the impact of varying velocity combinations of dual linear motors on the output speed of the differential drive system. (4) Results: Nonlinear friction factors exert an impact on the feed velocity of both linear-motor single-drive and dual linear-motor differential-drive systems during low-velocity micro feed. However, regardless of the constant or variable speed conditions, the dual linear-motor differential-drive servo system significantly outperforms the linear-motor single-drive system regarding low-velocity micro feed. Our simulation results are basically consistent with engineering practice, thus validating the rationality of the created system models, which paves the ground for the micro-feed control algorithms.},

ABSTRACT = {This article highlights the structural features of the detachable module for the transportation of long cargoes. The choice of profiles for the detachable module was based on the resistance moments of its components. The detachable module was considered a rod structure on four supports. To determine the longitudinal loads acting on the detachable module, mathematical modeling of its longitudinal dynamics was carried out, provided they were placed on a flat car during a shunting impact. The accelerations obtained were used for the calculations of the detachable module. This article presents the results of the strength calculation of the detachable module under asymmetric loading diagrams, i.e., the action of longitudinal and lateral forces on the detachable module structure. The results of the calculations show that the maximum stresses in the structure of the detachable module when it receives longitudinal loads are 7.7% lower than the permissible ones, and when it receives lateral loads, they are 5.8% lower. Thus, the strength of the detachable module is maintained under the loading diagrams considered. This study also included a modal analysis of the detachable module structure. The first natural frequency of oscillations is found to be 20 Hz. Thus, the safety of the detachable module movement in terms of frequency analysis is ensured. This research will help to create recommendations for the design of modern modular vehicles and improve the efficiency of the transport industry.},

ABSTRACT = {Due to machining errors, location inaccuracies, human error, and various other factors, it is challenging to avoid assembly errors during the production of spiral bevel gears (SBGs). When SBG assembly errors occur, it can cause the appearance of edge contact and may even lead to severe tooth tip chipping. In this study, we propose an improved method based on loaded tooth contact analysis (LTCA) to examine mesh characteristics, including time-varying mesh stiffness (TVMS), unloaded transmission error, and contact stress. Furthermore, we explore the effects of assembly errors and tooth tip chipping. Moreover, it is observed that assembly errors can alter the contact area of SBGs and potentially reduce the peak-to-peak value of TVMS. Additionally, the occurrence of tooth tip chipping decreases TVMS within the chipping region, lowers transmission error, and increases maximum contact stress. Notably, when assembly errors are present, the reduction in TVMS due to tooth tip chipping exceeds that of a properly assembled SBG pair.},

ABSTRACT = {Surface electromyography (sEMG) signals are the sum of action potentials emitted by many motor units; they contain the information of muscle contraction patterns and intensity, so they can be used as a simple and reliable source for grasping mode recognition. This paper introduces the InRes-ACNet (inception–attention–ACmix-ResNet50) model, a novel deep-learning approach based on ResNet50, incorporating multi-scale modules and self-attention mechanisms. The proposed model aims to improve gesture recognition performance by enhancing its ability to extract channel feature information within sparse sEMG signals. The InRes-ACNet model is evaluated on the NinaPro DB1 and NinaPro DB5 datasets; the recognition accuracy for these datasets can reach 87.94% and 87.04%, respectively, and recognition accuracy can reach 88.37% in the grasping mode prediction of an electromyography manipulator. The results show that the fusion of multi-scale modules and self-attention mechanisms endows a strong ability for the task of gesture recognition based on sparse sEMG signals.},

ABSTRACT = {The multi-dimensional optimization of mechanisms is a typical optimization problem encountered in mechanical design. Herein, the Hybrid strategy improved Beetle Antennae Search (HSBAS) algorithm is proposed to solve the multi-dimensional optimization problems encountered in structural design. To solve the problems of local optimization and low accuracy of the high-dimensional solution of the Beetle Antennae Search (BAS) algorithm, the algorithm adopts the adaptive step strategy, multi-directional exploration strategy, and Lens Opposition-Based Learning strategy, significantly reducing the probability of the algorithm falling into the local optimum and improving its global search capability. Comparative experiments of the improved algorithm are carried out by selecting eleven benchmark test functions. HSBAS can reach 1 × 10−22 accuracy from the optimal value when dealing with low-dimensional functions. It can also obtain 1 × 10−2 accuracy when dealing with high-dimensional functions, significantly improving the algorithm’s capability. According to Friedman’s ranking test result, HSBAS ranks first, which proves that HSBAS is superior to the other three algorithms. The HSBAS algorithm is further used to optimize the design of the altitude compensation module of the gravity compensation device for solar wings, controlling the fluctuation of bearing capacity within 0.25%, which shows that the algorithm can be used as an effective tool for engineering structural optimization problems.},

ABSTRACT = {The intricate design of real complex injection molds poses significant challenges. Mold design validation often falls to operators with tool-handling experience but limited CAD proficiency. Unlike other industries, the scale and costs of injection mold fabrication hinder prototyping before production. Virtual reality (VR) has emerged as a revolutionary solution offering a safe, immersive, and realistic experience and accessible using QR codes. This paper presents a new multimodal virtual environment tailored to validate mold design complexities. Integrating knowledge-enriched visual tools like interactive 3D models and dynamic visualizations enables users to explore complex mold designs. Statistical analyses, including the Wilcoxon test, unveil significant differences in interference detection, internal topology tracking, and validation of assembly and disassembly accessibility for both small and large mold components when comparing validation conducted through traditional means using solely CAD systems versus the utilization of multidimensional validation methods. Efficiency gains in using VR devices for mold design validation in a hybrid environment in the analysis of relative frequencies. The present study surpasses the state of the art illustrating how VR technology can substantially reduce manufacturing errors in injection molding processes, thereby offering important advantages for manufacturers emerging as an essential tool for this impact industry in the next years.},

ABSTRACT = {The importance of highly monitored and analyzed processes, linked by information systems such as knowledge graphs, is growing. In addition, the integration of operators has become urgent due to their high costs and from a social point of view. An appropriate framework for implementing the Industry 5.0 approach requires effective data exchange in a highly complex manufacturing network to utilize resources and information. Furthermore, the continuous development of collaboration between human and machine actors is fundamental for industrial cyber-physical systems, as the workforce is one of the most agile and flexible manufacturing resources. This paper introduces the human-centric knowledge graph framework by adapting ontologies and standards to model the operator-related factors such as monitoring movements, working conditions, or collaborating with robots. It also presents graph-based data querying, visualization, and analysis through an industrial case study. The main contribution of this work is a knowledge graph-based framework that focuses on the work performed by the operator, including the evaluation of movements, collaboration with machines, ergonomics, and other conditions. In addition, the use of the framework is demonstrated in a complex use case based on an assembly line, with examples of resource allocation and comprehensive support in terms of the collaboration aspect between shop-floor workers.},

ABSTRACT = {In order to study the influence of various parts of the structure of a wet dust removal fan for mining (including the number of driving impeller blades, the airfoil of the driving impeller blades, the number of driven impeller blades, the rear guide vane, the swirl guide vane, and the length of the outlet section) on dust removal performance, a wet dust removal fan for mining was modeled according to different structural parameters. The internal flow field and dust removal of the fan were then numerically simulated using the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) method. The results show that after the airflow passes through the swirl guide vane of the dust removal fan, there is an obvious swirl flow in the exit section of the dust removal fan. Under the action of centrifugal force, a large amount of dust is collected on the side wall of the exit section. With the increase in the number of driving impeller blades, the total pressure efficiency, static pressure efficiency, and dust removal efficiency of the dust removal fan decrease. When the driving impeller blade adopts the C-4 airfoil, the total pressure efficiency and static pressure efficiency of the dust removal fan are higher but the dust removal efficiency is lower than that of the same thickness circular plate airfoil. With the increase in the number of driven impeller blades, the power of the driving impeller shaft of the dust removal fan gradually increases; the total pressure and static pressure values first increase and then decrease; and the driven impeller speed, total pressure efficiency, static pressure efficiency, and dust removal efficiency gradually decrease. Adding the rear guide vane structure can improve the total pressure efficiency and static pressure efficiency of the dust removal fan but will reduce the dust removal efficiency of the dust removal fan. The increase in the swirl guide vane structure will reduce the total pressure efficiency and static pressure efficiency of the dust removal fan but the dust removal efficiency will be significantly improved. The extension of the outlet section of the dust removal fan will reduce the total pressure efficiency and static pressure efficiency of the dust removal fan, but the dust removal efficiency will increase. In this paper, by changing the structural parameters of the dust removal fan and establishing different models for numerical simulation and analysis, the influence law of the structural parameters of the dust removal fan on the dust removal performance is obtained, providing a way to improve the performance of the dust removal fan.},

ABSTRACT = {The meaningful problem of improving crane safety, reliability, and efficiency is extensively studied in the literature and targeted via various model-based control approaches. In recent years, crane data-driven modeling has attracted much attention compared to physics-based models, particularly due to its potential in real-time crane control applications, specifically in model predictive control. This paper proposes grammar-guided genetic programming with sparse regression (G3P-SR) to identify the nonlinear dynamics of an underactuated crane system. G3P-SR uses grammars to bias the search space and produces a fixed number of candidate model terms, while a local search method based on an l0-regularized regression results in a sparse solution, thereby also reducing model complexity as well as reducing the probability of overfitting. Identification is performed on experimental data obtained from a laboratory-scale overhead crane. The proposed method is compared with multi-gene genetic programming (MGGP), NARX neural network, and Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy (TSF) ARX models in terms of model complexity, prediction accuracy, and sensitivity. The G3P-SR algorithm evolved a model with a maximum mean square error (MSE) of crane velocity and sway prediction of 1.1860 × 10−4 and 4.8531 × 10−4, respectively, in simulations for different testing data sets, showing better accuracy than the TSF ARX and MGGP models. Only the NARX neural network model with velocity and sway maximum MSEs of 1.4595 × 10−4 and 4.8571 × 10−4 achieves a similar accuracy or an even better one in some testing scenarios, but at the cost of increasing the total number of parameters to be estimated by over 300% and the number of output lags compared to the G3P-SR model. Moreover, the G3P-SR model is proven to be notably less sensitive, exhibiting the least deviation from the nominal trajectory for deviations in the payload mass by approximately a factor of 10.},

Adaptive sliding mode control enhances the system’s robustness to external non-repetitive disturbances, and exponential gain iterative learning control compensates for the influence of periodic disturbances such as cutting force. The experimental results show that the proposed iterative learning controller based on adaptive sliding mode control can effectively eliminate the influence of various interference factors, achieve accurate tracking of the FTS system’s motion trajectory within a limited number of iterations, and ensure the stability of the system, which has the advantages of a fast convergence speed, high tracking accuracy, and strong robustness.},

ABSTRACT = {Trochoidal milling is one of the solutions for increasing the efficiency of machining processes. A decreased cutting tool’s arc of contact leads to a reduction in the generated cutting forces, thus improving process stability. Vibration is an inherent part of any machining process, affecting the accuracy and quality of the manufactured components, but it can also pose a danger to machine operators. Chatter is particularly detrimental, leaving characteristic marks on shaped surfaces and potentially leading to catastrophic tool damage. Therefore, it is important to ensure the stability of machining and also reduce vibration. The primary purpose of the conducted research is to evaluate the stability of the milling process of the AZ91D magnesium alloy performed through a trochoidal strategy. An additional objective is to establish the effect of the variation in machining parameters and toolholder types on milling stability. Three types of toolholders most commonly used in industry are used in the study. The basis of the investigation is the measurement of vibration displacement and acceleration analysed in the time domain. A spectral analysis of the signals is also performed based on Fast Fourier Transform, to identify signal components and detect the susceptibility to chatter occurrence. An important part of the study is also an attempt to use the Composite Multiscale Entropy as an indicator to determine the stability of the machining processes. Entropy does not exceed the values of 1.5 for cutting speed and 2.5 for feed per tooth, respectively. Vibration acceleration does not exceed (in most cases) the value of 20 m/s2 for the peak-to-peak parameter and the shrinkfit toolholder. For vibration displacement (peak-to-peak parameter), there are oscillations around the value of 0.9 mm for all kinds of toolholders.},

ABSTRACT = {Upon careful examination, numerous wind turbine collapses can be attributed to the failure of the tower bolts. Nowadays, the Schmidt–Neuper algorithm is extensively accepted in wind turbine tower bolt design. It is not advisable to utilize the finite-element method, notwithstanding the effect of the flange gap. To quantitatively investigate the influence of flange gaps on bolt fatigue, a nonlinear finite-element model of a flange segment incorporating bolt pretension and contact elements is herein proposed. Three distinct types of flange gaps are defined intentionally. It is possible to determine the nonlinear relationship between the wall load and bolt internal force. The fatigue damage of bolts was thus computed using the obtained nonlinear curve. Comparing with the results with those of Schmidt–Neuper method revealed the bolt fatigue damage is susceptible to a specified flange gap.},

ABSTRACT = {As a load-bearing tool, steel wire rope plays an important role in industrial production. Therefore, diagnosing the fracture and damage of steel wire ropes is of great significance for ensuring their safe operation. However, the detection and identification of wire rope breakage damage mainly focus on identifying external damage characteristics, while research on inspecting internal breakage damage is still relatively limited. To address the challenge, an intelligent detecting method is proposed in this paper for diagnosing internal wire breakage damage, and it introduces residual modules to enhance the network’s feature extraction ability. Firstly, time–frequency analysis techniques are used to convert the extracted one-dimensional magnetic flux leakage (MFL) signal into a two-dimensional time–frequency map. Secondly, the focus of this article is on constructing a residual network to identify the internal damage accurately with the features of the time–frequency map of the MFL signal being automatically extracted. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method in identifying broken wires is verified through comparative experiments on detecting broken wires in steel wire ropes. Three common recognition methods, the backpropagation (BP) neural network, the support vector machine (SVM), and the convolutional neural network (CNN), are used as comparisons. The experimental results show that the residual network recognition method can effectively identify internal and external wire breakage faults in steel wire ropes, which is of great significance for achieving quantitative detection of steel wire ropes.},

ABSTRACT = {In light of recent advancements in synchrotron radiation technology and nano-technology, there has been a marked increase in the need for ultra-precision nano-positioning mechanisms. This paper presents a method that integrates physical models with multi-objective optimization for developing an optical angle nano-positioning mechanism. We begin by examining the actual motion law of the mechanism, based on kinematic principles. The outcomes from this kinematic analysis facilitate a static analysis of the flexible hinge, identified as a critical component of the mechanism. Subsequently, we establish a dynamic model for the entire mechanism. By employing the physical model as a base and combining it with the optimization algorithm, we identify the optimal design parameters for the mechanism. The design achieves a resolution of 50 nrad and meets the specified requirements. The first-order inherent frequency of the mechanism is approximately 43.75 Hz. There is a discrepancy of 2.63% from the finite element modal analysis results and a 3.33% difference from the theoretical analysis results, validating the reliability of the design method proposed in this study.},

ABSTRACT = {Oil/air two-phase flow distribution in the bearings is the basis for bearing lubrication status identification and precise thermal analysis of the bearing. In order to understand the fluid behavior inside the under-race lubrication ball bearing and obtain an accurate oil volume fraction prediction model. A numerical study of ball bearing with under-race lubrication is carried out to study oil-gas two-phase distribution inside the bearing, and the influence of several parameters is quantified, like bearing rotating speed, oil flow rate, oil viscosity, and oil density. The results indicate that the oil fraction in the bearing cavity between the inner and outer ring shows a periodic distribution along the circumference direction, and the period is the same as the number of under-race oil supply holes. Oil distribution alone radial direction is affected by the outer-ring-guiding cage and centrifugal force, leading to oil accumulation near the outer ring. Different bearing running conditions and oil characteristics do not change the oil distribution trend alone in circumference and radial direction, but the difference ratio. Finally, based on the numerical simulation results, a formula for the average oil volume fraction prediction in the bearing ring cavity is constructed.},

ABSTRACT = {In general, when using infrared thermography (IRT) techniques to excite a heat source on the surface of an inspection object, the heat source is focused on the center of the image of the infrared (IR) camera. If the object to be inspected is small, uniform excitation of the heat source is possible, but if the area is large, the heat source is concentrated locally, resulting in uneven heat distribution. Therefore, in this study, heat distribution was analyzed after inducing a non-uniform heat source by exciting the heat source at different locations. Additionally, the fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm with Gaussian filtering was applied to resolve the non-uniform distribution of the heat sources. Excellent results were obtained from the amplitude image, and the effectiveness of the FFT algorithm was verified using the Otsu algorithm. Finally, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) was calculated, and the detection ability according to each thinning rate was analyzed.},

ABSTRACT = {Hydrogen is used as a fuel in various fields, such as aviation, space, and automobiles, due to its high specific energy. Hydrogen can be stored as a compressed gas at high pressure and as a liquid at cryogenic temperatures. In order to keep liquid hydrogen at a cryogenic temperature, the tanks for storing liquid hydrogen are required to have insulation to prevent heat leakage. When liquid hydrogen is vaporized by heat inflow, a large pressure is generated inside the tank. Therefore, a technology capable of predicting the tank pressure is required for cryogenic liquid hydrogen tanks. In this study, a thermodynamic model was developed to predict the maximum internal pressure and pressure behavior of cryogenic liquid hydrogen fuel tanks. The developed model considers the heat inflow of the tank due to heat transfer, the phase change from liquid to gas hydrogen, and the fuel consumption rate. To verify the accuracy of the proposed model, it was compared with the analyses and experimental results in the referenced literature, and the model presented good results. A cryogenic liquid hydrogen fuel tank was simulated using the proposed model, and it was confirmed that the storage time, along with conditions such as the fuel filling ratio of liquid hydrogen and the fuel consumption rate, should be considered when designing the fuel tanks. Finally, it was confirmed that the proposed thermodynamic model can be used to sufficiently predict the internal pressure and the pressure behavior of cryogenic liquid hydrogen fuel tanks.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper addresses the challenge of mitigating low-frequency flow noise signals in autonomous underwater vehicles through the optimization of a placoid-scale skin. Drawing inspiration from the bio-inspired surface features of cylindrical shell structures, an enhanced design of placoid-scale skin is developed using 3D printing technology. This improved structure effectively reduced boundary layer vortices and wake intensity, thereby contributing to the suppression of low-frequency flow noise signals. Experimental results demonstrate that the notable reduction in low-frequency flow noise within the frequency range of 0–500 Hz, with average noise reduction of approximately 5 dB observed at 150 Hz. This reduction is validated by a combination of numerical simulations and experimental testing, confirming the efficacy of the optimized placoid-scale skin in attenuating the low-frequency flow noise associated with uniformly advancing turbulent boundary layers underwater.},

ABSTRACT = {Osteoporosis constitutes a significant public health concern necessitating proactive prevention, treatment, and monitoring efforts. Timely identification holds paramount importance in averting fractures and alleviating the overall disease burden. The realm of osteoporosis diagnosis has witnessed a surge in interest in machine learning applications. This burgeoning technology excels at recognizing patterns and forecasting the onset of osteoporosis, paving the way for more efficacious preventive and therapeutic interventions. Smart walkers emerge as valuable tools in this context, serving as data acquisition platforms for datasets tailored to machine learning techniques. These datasets, trained to discern patterns indicative of osteoporosis, play a pivotal role in enhancing diagnostic accuracy. In this study, encompassing 40 participants—20 exhibiting robust health and 20 diagnosed with osteoporosis—data from force sensors embedded in the handlebars of conventional walkers were gathered. A windowing action was used to increase the size of the dataset. The data were normalized, and k-fold cross-validation was applied to assess how well our model performs on untrained data. We used multiple machine learning algorithms to create an accurate model for automatic monitoring of users’ gait, with the Random Forest classifier performing the best with 95.40% accuracy. To achieve the best classification accuracy on the validation dataset, the hyperparameters of the Random Forest classifier were further adjusted on the training data. The results suggest that machine learning-based automatic monitoring of gait parameters could lead to accurate, non-laborious, cost-effective, and efficient diagnostic tools for osteoporosis and other musculoskeletal disorders. Further research is needed to validate these findings.},

ABSTRACT = {Structures must provide strength, stability, and stiffness to buildings and at the same time be efficient. This study addressed the effect of design elements and parameters on the strength of bolted lateral connections in steel beams under bending using the component-based finite element method. The variables evaluated were plate thickness, horizontal and vertical spacing between bolts, and geometric arrangement of bolts. Finite element software was used to evaluate the stress state of the junction plate, its plastic deformation, and bolt shear. A sensitivity analysis was performed to determine which bolt arrangements result in safer and more efficient designs using the same components. Stress distribution within the junction plate and plastic deformation values were used to evaluate the structural performance of the joints according to EuroCode 3. The results showed that placing bolts near the edge of a plate affected the bolts’ utilization, especially with thinner plates. Additionally, introducing an offset between central and outer bolt rows is not recommended as it worsened the stress distribution and the structural performance.},

ABSTRACT = {Oil spill cleanup in water remains a critical challenge due to the harmful secondary pollution from conventional methods such as burning or chemical degradation. Herein, we present a facile method to fabricate a superhydrophobic and superoleophilic polyurethane (PU) foil for efficient and environmentally friendly oil/water separation. More specifically, micropillar arrays were embedded onto the foil surface through a nanoimprinting process. Microporous structures were generated at the foil cross-section by a supercritical carbon dioxide (CO2) saturation method. The dimensions of pillar and pore structures were optimized with the aim of boosting selective wetting (i.e., water repellency and oil attraction) properties. As a result, the developed PU foil shows an oil absorption efficiency nearly 4 times higher than a pristine reference. Moreover, the structured PU foil stably retains the absorbed oil for over a week, demonstrating an absorption capacity of nearly 400%, which is also much superior than the unstructured sample. Our concept of combining both topographical micropillars and cross-sectional micropores onto PU foil provides a novel approach for achieving efficient and environmental friendly oil/water separation.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper evaluates the performance of the Rubin reduction methods, enhanced with static modal derivatives, for vibration analysis of geometrically nonlinear structures with friction contact. Static modal derivatives are computed numerically based on Rubin reduction, which includes free interface normal modes and residual flexibility attachment modes, by introducing a finite displacement around these modes. Then, the most relevant static modal derivatives are selected using an improved strategy that incorporates weighting factors derived from both a nonlinear static analysis and a geometrically linear transient run. This enhanced Rubin method is also compared with the previously used enhanced Craig–Bampton method, which is based on fixed normal modes, constraint modes, and their static derivatives. The effectiveness of these methods is demonstrated through vibration analysis of a geometrically nonlinear beam in different contact configurations. Both methods proved their robustness, achieving accurate results with a relatively small number of modes in the reduced space, thus ensuring low online computation times. Furthermore, the analyses show the significant impact of using a geometrically nonlinear model on the accurate prediction of a contact state.},

ABSTRACT = {Front loaders used in agriculture are characterized by a compact structure, which limits the scope of their application. The loading possibilities are expanded by designing front loaders equipped with telescopic arms. This design increases the loader’s working area, making it easier to load trucks. It is necessary to work on the arm extension drive and perform strength analyses on the new structures. This article presents a FEM numerical analysis of the structure of an extending front loader and an assessment of the state of stress and the value of displacements under the influence of load. This study discusses the advantages and disadvantages of front loaders compared to telehandlers and the legal requirements and standards for the design of front loaders in Europe. This work presents the concept of loader arm movement and assesses the effectiveness of using hydraulic motors coupled with a screw gear. The obtained results prove that the newly designed extending front loader system is safe and stable.},

Heat transfer coefficients, pressure drops, and thermal capacity were systematically evaluated as functions of wall thickness, lattice cell density, and materials. It turns out that when thermal conductivity is above 100 W/m·K, gyroid HXs are less sensitive to variations in thickness and thermal conductivity. Additive manufacturing of 20 kW aluminum heat exchangers was successful and testing results are comparable with theoretical prediction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a working prototype of TPMS HXs.},

ABSTRACT = {The object of the upgrade presented in this paper was an older analogue-based universal testing machine preferably designed for tensile testing. The objective of the upgrade was to create a new digitized measurement chain capable of also operating in the mode of simple fatigue tests with cyclic tensile stresses. The upgrade of the equipment mainly included the processes of calibration, creation of related calibration jigs, creation of transformation dependencies and digitization, creation or completion of missing parts of chain-signal conditioning modules, A/D converters, special jigs, etc., as elements of the experimental hardware. The degree of correctness of the calibration and of the transformation dependencies created was verified by regression analysis, and this was verified by simple correlation analysis. The correctness of the proposed modifications, was verified on the basis of the fatigue tests performed for cyclic loading. Thus, it was possible to design, develop and functionally verify a new measurement chain based on an older universal testing machine. Thus, a partially digitized pulsator was created for the possibility of fatigue testing in a technically or functionally limited mode, mainly for educational purposes as a temporary replacement for the order of magnitude more expensive commercially produced test systems.},

ABSTRACT = {To assess the ergonomic risk level in work systems involving tasks performed with hands or fingers, it is necessary to know the exerted triaxial forces. To address this need, a prototype of a triaxial load cell based on principles of linear elasticity theory and mechanical problems of torsion, bending and axial load is presented. This work includes an analytical strain model for each instrumented point and its solution regarding the applied force to a triaxial load cell. The proposed load cell was calibrated and validated by performing different static experimental tests. As a case study, the applied force in three directions while the thumb activates a cigarette lighter was measured. Triaxial forces and resultant forces were obtained and compared with the parameter of 10 N established by the ergonomic standards as reference values for pressing down with the thumb, finding that the applied forces in eight tests were 23.73 N, 43.51 N, 12.69 N, 14.50 N 20.35 N, 21.67 N, 39.74 N and 46.02 N, exceeding the reference values and establishing a direct relationship with Quervain syndrome. In conclusion, the developed load cell is a valid and reliable alternative to measure many forces that cannot be obtained with commercial devices, allowing the level of ergonomic risk to be determined with great precision.},

ABSTRACT = {Mechanical water detection is recognized as the most reliable and safe production technology for coal mines, mainly for the detection of water hazards in pre-mining operations. Intelligent water detectors are currently the main research direction in mechanical water detection, and the automatic installation of drilling bars is the key to achieving intelligent water detection. Improving the connection accuracy in the process of installing drilling bars is an important research topic for the improvement of control links. To improve the connection accuracy of the drilling bars at the time of supplying material, we used the modified Denavit–Hartenberg method to analyze the motion gestures of the supplied material device and the Lagrange equation to establish a dynamic analysis model. We aimed at better control precision by improving the sliding mode control algorithm and at increasing the convergence rate of tracking errors with a sliding controller based on an exponential approximation law and using saturated functions instead of the symbol functions in the reaching law to weaken the vibration in the control process. We then used particle swarm optimization (PSO) to find the optimum combination parameters of the sliding mode controllers and test the performance of the sliding mode controllers before and after PSO with MATLAB/Simulink. The results showed that the optimized controller has a strong resistance to parameter fluctuations, and the system responds quickly, achieves a good performance, and improves the convergence rate of tracking errors.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper presents an indirect adaptive neural network (NN) control algorithm tailored for flexible joint robots (FJRs), aimed at achieving desired transient and steady-state performance. To simplify the controller design process, the original higher-order system is decomposed into two lower-order subsystems using the singular perturbation technique (SPT). NNs are then employed to reconstruct the aggregated uncertainties. An adaptive prescribed performance control (PPC) strategy and a continuous terminal sliding mode control strategy are introduced for the reduced slow subsystem and fast subsystem, respectively, to guarantee a specified convergence speed and steady-state accuracy for the closed-loop system. Additionally, a composite-learning optimal bounded ellipsoid algorithm (OBE)-based identification scheme is proposed to update the NN weights, where the tracking errors of the reduced slow and fast subsystems are integrated into the learning algorithm to enhance the identification and tracking performance. The stability of the closed-loop system is rigorously established using the Lyapunov approach. Simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed identification and control schemes.},

ABSTRACT = {The advancement of sensor, actuator, and flight control technologies has increasingly expanded the possibilities for drone utilization. Among the technologies related to drone applications, the vibration isolator technology for payload has a significant impact on the precision of optical equipment in missions such as detection, reconnaissance, and tracking. However, despite ongoing efforts to develop vibration isolators to mitigate the impact of vibrations transmitted to optical equipment, research on drone-specific natural frequencies and payloads has been lacking. Consequently, there is a need for research on vibration isolators tailored to specific drone types and optical equipment payloads. This study focuses on exploring the correlation between the natural frequencies of drones and the weight of the payload, and proposes methods for developing and testing vibration isolators that consider both factors. To achieve this, the study measured the stiffness of vibration isolator rubbers and conducted cross-validation between random vibration tests and finite element method (FEM) analyses to verify the vibration reduction effects resulting from changes in the dynamic characteristics of vibration isolator rubbers. The rubber with a shore hardness of 70 exhibited relatively high damping and damping performance during random vibration tests. Additionally, it showed relatively high stability with only one resonance point measured within the operational frequency band. Through the findings of this study, a methodology for selecting vibration isolators for drones is proposed, aiming to enhance the stability of optical equipment.},

ABSTRACT = {The challenge of mixing high-viscosity materials is a common issue encountered in the manufacturing process of food materials. The advantages of the internal meshing screw mixer have led to its adoption in various manufacturing processes, but it has yet to be implemented in the food industry. The paper presents a design method for an internal meshing screw mixer based on kinematic principles. The mixer features a helical chamber created by alternating volumes formed by the stator and rotor, establishing an extension-dominated environment for mixing high-viscosity fluids. A kinematic model based on the internal cycloid principle was established, providing trajectories and equations for key points on the rotor, simulating both its rotation and revolution processes, and revealing the velocity variations at different points on the rotor. Based on the kinematic analysis results, a stator and rotor design method was developed according to relevant functional divisions. To achieve the desired motion effects, transmission and support devices were designed, and the relationship between the transmission device and the internal cycloid surface of the fixed rotor was established. The mixer’s application and mixing effectiveness in the food industry were validated using corn syrup and flour. Experimental results showed that the extensional mixer described in the paper effectively mixed high-viscosity fluids while also efficiently blending fine powders. Slurry viscosity was tested with a rheometer at different speeds with an eccentric rotor mixer. Results showed that viscosity decreased with increasing shear rate, with a more pronounced decrease at higher shear rates. The apparent viscosity trend remained consistent at different speeds, although variations were observed at lower shear rates, especially concerning speed. The non-Newtonian fluid index exhibited minimal variations at different speeds, while the consistency coefficient showed significant fluctuations. The mixing uniformity index of the slurry was used to evaluate the mixing uniformity and dispersion uniformity of this extensional mixer. At different rotational speeds, the density of the slurry changes little. The uniformity index of mixing decreases gradually with the increase of rotational speed, reaching its maximum at 15 r/min. The overall trend of the uniformity index decreases with increasing rotational speed, indicating a decrease in density uniformity. A peak appears at 45 r/min, possibly due to the maximum values of elongation rate and shear rate at this speed. As the rotational speed increases, the residence time of the material in the mixer decreases, which may be the main reason for the decrease in mixing uniformity. These findings provide valuable insights into the design and utilization of extension-dominated screw mixers within the food industry, laying a solid foundation for future research and practical applications in this field.},

ABSTRACT = {The mud pump water sealing system (MPWSS) is important in the efficient operation and prolonged service life of the cutter suction dredger’s (CSD) mud pump. Considering that the underwater pump operates underwater and the shaft seal water pressure sensor is prone to failure, a hybrid deep learning model MCNN transformer is proposed to predict the underwater pump shaft seal water pressure in the event of sensor failure. This paper uses big data from the dredging project to deeply excavate the relationship between the shaft end sealing water pressure and other construction data by combining experience and artificial intelligence, and then uses multi-scale convolutional neural network (MCNN) to reconstruct the data, highlighting the time series characteristics of the multi-scale data were then input into the transformer model for prediction, and compared with a single MCNN, transformer model and four other neural networks. Finally, the cutter suction dredger “Hua An Long” was selected as an application research case; experimental comparisons were conducted on seven different models to verify the accuracy and applicability of the MCNN-transformer model.},

ABSTRACT = {Access control systems are part of the overall protection of objects. It is often the first system with which it is necessary to start the contact system; therefore, it is necessary to ensure its proper functioning. In the event of a malfunction, it can cause downtime in production, and it is triggered by a bad replacement of workers. Access control systems have their own specificities that need to be considered when designing security. Poor selection of access control devices can cause inefficient system functionality, resulting in downtime and loss. Based on experimental testing and related work in access control systems, this paper discusses the possibilities of testing the throughput of access control systems. The manuscript presents the design of a unique test device that can be used in the assessment of the reliability and throughput of access control systems. With the help of tests, we were able to determine the probability of downtime due to inappropriately set time intervals for changing employees on a work shift.},

ABSTRACT = {Aiming at the phenomenon that a high-power torque converter is susceptible to cavitation, which leads to performance degradation, first, a transient flow field model of the torque converter is established, and CFD simulation and experimental research on the torque converter are carried out to find out the speed ratio region where cavitation occurs in the torque converter as well as the rule of occurrence of cavitation, and then the cavitation identification method based on the difference between the inlet and outlet flow of the torque converter is proposed. Then, the transient flow process inside the torque converter is analyzed, and it is pointed out that the angle between the inlet angle of the stator and the outlet angle of the turbine of the torque converter, i.e., the fluid inflow injection deviation angle is an important factor affecting the cavitation phenomenon. By adjusting the key parameters of the stator blade bone line, the fluid inflow deviation angle of the torque converter stator is optimized, so that the speed ratio range of cavitation under large load conditions is greatly reduced from the original 0–0.5 (50%) to 0–0.15 (15%). Meanwhile, in terms of test performance, the nominal torque of the torque converter is greatly improved under the premise of ensuring that the performance is basically unchanged, in which the nominal torque of the test zero speed is increased by 28.7%, and the cavitation of the torque converter has been greatly improved.},

ABSTRACT = {Centrifugal compressors are frequently used in both military and commercial areas because they can be easily manufactured and reach high-pressure compression ratios. The factor that limits the performance and operating range of compressors is flow instability. Many ideas have been put forward for performance improvement, but tandem blade radial compressors, which do not require an extra air system, have attracted the most interest. In this study, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analyses were carried out on various parameters of the tandem blade (TB) radial compressor, and an optimization study was carried out to find the best design using a genetic algorithm on a whole operating curve. It was investigated how these parameters affected the efficiency and total pressure ratio between the determined lower and upper limits. The numerical analyses of the optimum design obtained as a result of the iterations were carried out. As a result of the iterations, three optimum designs were obtained and numerical analysis was carried out according to one of them, and then they were compared with the results in the literature. The general agreement of computational fluid dynamics and the literature data served as a validation for the computational approach. The error rates between the numerical analysis results and the experimental results in the literature were calculated for different flow rates and were found to be 1.98% as the highest and 0.35 as the lowest. The work carried out in this article will provide a valuable reference for future advanced tandem blade compressor designs.},

ABSTRACT = {In the design of flapping-wing micro-size air vehicles capable of hovering, wings serve as the primary source of hovering power, making the analysis of aerodynamics and aerodynamic efficiency crucial. Traditional quasi-steady models treat the wings as single rigid plane, neglecting the deformable characteristics of flexible wings. This paper proposes a multi-plane method that, in conjunction with various design parameters of flexible wings in a two-dimensional plane, analyzes their deformation characteristics under the assumption of multiple planes in three-dimensional space, and describes the deformation of wings during flapping. By combining the quasi-steady aerodynamic model, aerodynamic analysis of the deformed wings can be conducted. The relationship between the slack angle, wing flapping position, and wing deformation are analyzed, along with their effects on aerodynamics and aerodynamic efficiency. Experiments validate the deformation patterns of wings during flapping and compare the simulated aerodynamic forces with measured ones. The results indicate that wing deformation can be accurately described by adjusting the parameters in the multi-plane method and that the aerodynamic analysis using this method closely approximates the average lift results. Additionally, the multi-plane method establishes a connection between wing morphology and aerodynamic forces and efficiency, providing valuable insights for aerodynamic analysis.},

ABSTRACT = {The purpose of this study is to determine the material properties of CFRP composites in the form of a fabric for the construction of racing car bodywork. This work focused on the determination of the strength and tribological properties as well as investigating the effects of the operating environment on the developed material. Three material variants, differing in the number of layers used to produce the reinforcement, were used in this study. The tests were carried out on two-/three-/four-layer sheets produced by infusion. Due to the later use of the tested composites for the sheathing of a racing car, the results obtained were analysed in terms of the most favourable strength properties while keeping the weight as low as possible. In this study, the hardness, impact strength, and tensile and bending stresses of the developed composites were examined. In addition to the strength properties, the density, the effects of immersion in water, and the composite’s resistance to staining and friction in the presence of aggressive media were also checked. The structure and the breakthroughs resulting from the strength tests were observed using a stereoscopic microscope. The material’s resistance to sunlight and UVB was also tested.},

ABSTRACT = {Traditional data-driven tool wear state recognition methods rely on complete data under targeted working conditions. However, in actual cutting operations, working conditions vary, and data for many conditions lack labels, with data distribution characteristics differing between conditions. To address these issues, this article proposes a method for recognizing the wear state of milling cutters under varying working conditions based on an optimized symmetrized dot pattern (SDP). This method utilizes complete data from source working conditions for representation learning, transferring a generalized milling cutter wear state recognition model to varying working condition scenarios. By leveraging computer image processing features, the vibration signals produced by milling are converted into desymmetrization dot pattern images. Clustering analysis is used to extract template images of different wear states, and differential evolution algorithms are employed to adaptively optimize parameters using the maximization of Euclidean distance as an indicator. Transfer learning with a residual network incorporating an attention mechanism is used to recognize the wear state of milling cutters under varying working conditions. The experimental results indicate that the method proposed in this paper reduces the impact of working condition changes on the mapping relationship of milling cutter wear states. In the wear state identification experiment under varying conditions, the accuracy reached 97.39%, demonstrating good recognition precision and generalization ability.},

ABSTRACT = {Controlling overlay in lithography is crucial for improving the yield of integrated circuit manufacturing. The process disturbances can cause undesirable morphology changes of overlay targets (such as asymmetric grating), which can significantly impact the accuracy of overlay metrology. It is essential to decouple the overlay target asymmetry from the wafer deformation, ensuring that the overlay metrology is free from the influence of process-induced asymmetry (e.g., grating asymmetry and grating imbalance). Herein, we use an asymmetric grating as a model and show that using high-diffraction-order light can mitigate the impact of asymmetric grating through the rigorous coupled-wave analysis (RCWA) method. In addition, we demonstrate the diffraction efficiency as a function of the diffraction order, wavelength, and pitch, which has guiding significance for improving the measurement accuracy of diffraction-based overlay (DBO) metrology.},

ABSTRACT = {The flow in the draft tube of the water turbine is affected by the upstream flow and the inherent structure accompanied by various undesirable characteristics, affecting the efficient and stable operation of the water turbine. Changing the flow structure downstream of the runner is an important measure to reduce hydraulic loss in the draft tube and improve stability. In this study, three downstream structures of the runner, namely, the non-locking nut, small locking nut, and extended locking nut are numerically calculated and verified using experimental results. The unstable flow characteristics of the draft tube are analyzed using variations in swirling flow, backflow, pressure gradient, and vortex strip. The results show the non-negligible effect of the locking nut, which significantly reduces the rotational momentum flux at the draft tube inlet, accelerates the decay rate of the swirling flow, and suppresses the generation of axial low pressure. The small locking nut significantly reduces the pressure gradient, shortens the backflow zone, and decreases the backflow velocity. The extended locking nut reduces the backflow zone in some sections and reduces the vortex zone of the straight section but prolongs the backflow zone and increases the backflow velocity.},

ABSTRACT = {A transportation system requires an asymmetry to achieve objects’ motion on an oscillating surface. Transportation methods based on vibrational techniques usually employ different types of asymmetries, such as temporal (time) asymmetry, kinematic asymmetry, wave asymmetry or power asymmetry. However, transporting an object on an inclined angle requires a relatively high net frictional force over each period of vibrational cycles due to the gravitational potential energy exerted on the object. This paper investigates the transportation of an object upward on an inclined plane that harmonically oscillates in its longitudinal direction. The novelty of this research is attributed to the upward motion of the object on the inclined plane, which is achieved by creating an additional asymmetry of the system through dry friction dynamic manipulations. For this reason, periodic dynamic dry friction manipulations have been employed to create the asymmetry of frictional conditions, resulting in a net frictional force that outweighs the gravitational force. A mathematical model has been developed using the Lagrange method, which describes the moving object’s motion. Moreover, the theoretical findings and results confirmed that the object’s velocity and direction can be controlled by dynamic dry friction manipulations. To demonstrate the technical feasibility of the proposed method, an experimental investigation was carried out where the results demonstrated that the control parameters significantly influence the characteristics of the directional motion of the moving object. This transportation method is beneficial for various modern industries engaged in transportation and manipulation tasks with objects spanning a broad range of sizes, including those operating at small scales for applications in lab-on-a-chip technology, micro-assembly lines, micro-feeder systems and other delicate component manipulation systems. The presented research advances the classical theories of vibrational transportation on inclined surfaces.},
