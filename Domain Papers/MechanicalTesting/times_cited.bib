ABSTRACT = {In order to build a better understanding of the relationship between depositing mode and porosity, microstructure, and properties in wire + arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) 2319-Al components, several Al-6.3%Cu deposits were produced by WAAM technique with cold metal transfer (CMT) variants, pulsed CMT (CMT-P) and advanced CMT (CMT-ADV). Thin walls and blocks were selected as the depositing paths to make WAAM samples. Porosity, microstructure and micro hardness of these WAAM samples were investigated. Compared with CMT-P and thin wall mode, CMT-ADV and block process can effectively reduce the pores in WAAM aluminum alloy. The microstructure varied with different depositing paths and CMT variants. The micro hardness value of thin wall samples was around 75 HV from the bottom to the middle, and gradually decreased toward the top. Meanwhile, the micro hardness value ranged around 72–77 HV, and varied periodically in block samples. The variation in micro hardness is consistent with standard microstructure characteristics.},

ABSTRACT = {Graphene oxide (GO) has a unique layered structure with excellent gas and liquid blocking properties. It is widely used in many areas, such as gas sensors, carbon-based electronics, impermeable membranes, and polymeric composite materials. In order to evaluate whether GO (1% and 3% by weight of asphalt) can improve the aging resistance performance of the asphalt, 80/100 penetration grade asphalt (90 A) and styrene–butadiene–styrene modified asphalt (SBS MA) were used to prepare the GO modified asphalt by the melt blending method. The surface morphology of the GO was analyzed by scanning electron microscope (SEM). The UV aging test was conducted to simulate the aging during the service period. After UV aging test, the physical performances of GO-modified asphalts were tested, and the IC=O and IS=O increments were tested by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) to evaluate the aging resistance performance of the GO modified asphalt. In addition, the rheological properties of GO modified asphalts were studied using a dynamic shear rheometer (DSR). The SEM analysis indicated that the GO exhibits many shared edges, and no agglomeration phenomenon was found. With respect to the physical performance test, the FTIR and the DSR results show that GO can improve the UV aging resistance performance of 90 A and SBS MA. In addition, the analysis indicated that the improvement effect of 3% GO is better than the 1% GO. The testing on the rheological properties of the modified asphalt indicated that the GO can also improve the thermo-oxidative aging resistance performance of asphalt.},

ABSTRACT = {The problem of inverse kinematics is fundamental in robot control. Many traditional inverse kinematics solutions, such as geometry, iteration, and algebraic methods, are inadequate in high-speed solutions and accurate positioning. In recent years, the problem of robot inverse kinematics based on neural networks has received extensive attention, but its precision control is convenient and needs to be improved. This paper studies a particle swarm optimization (PSO) back propagation (BP) neural network algorithm to solve the inverse kinematics problem of a UR3 robot based on six degrees of freedom, overcoming some disadvantages of BP neural networks. The BP neural network improves the convergence precision, convergence speed, and generalization ability. The results show that the position error is solved by the research method with respect to the UR3 robot inverse kinematics with the joint angle less than 0.1 degrees and the output end tool less than 0.1 mm, achieving the required positioning for medical puncture surgery, which demands precise positioning of the robot to less than 1 mm. Aiming at the precise application of the puncturing robot, the preliminary experiment has been conducted and the preliminary results have been obtained, which lays the foundation for the popularization of the robot in the medical field.},

ABSTRACT = {Rolling bearings are key components of rotary machines. To ensure early effective fault diagnosis for bearings, a new rolling bearing fault diagnosis method based on variational mode decomposition (VMD) and an improved kernel extreme learning machine (KELM) is proposed in this paper. A fault signal is decomposed via VMD to obtain the intrinsic mode function (IMF) components, and the approximate entropy (ApEn) of the IMF component containing the main fault information is calculated. An eigenvector is created from the approximate entropy of each component. A bearing diagnosis model is created via a KELM; the KELM parameters are optimized using the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to obtain a KELM diagnosis model with optimal parameters. Finally, the effectiveness of the diagnosis method proposed in this paper is verified via a fan bearing fault diagnosis test. Under identical conditions, the result is compared with the results obtained using a back propagation (BP) neural network, a conventional extreme learning machine (ELM), and a support vector machine (SVM). The test result shows that the method proposed in this paper is superior to the other three methods in terms of diagnostic accuracy.},

Data obtained from experiments were defined both Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Response Surface Methodology (RSM). ANN trained network using Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) and weights were trained. On the other hand, the mathematical models in RSM were created applying Box Behnken design. Values obtained from the ANN and the RSM was found to be very close to the data obtained from experimental studies. The lowest cutting force and surface roughness were obtained at high cutting speeds and low feed rate and depth of cut. The minimum tool wear was obtained at low cutting speed, feed rate, and depth of cut.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper proposes a hybrid WAAM (wire arc additive manufacturing) and milling process (HWMP), and highlights its application in the fabrication of stiffened panels that have wide applications in aviation, aerospace, and automotive industries, etc. due to their light weight and strong load-bearing capability. In contrast to existing joining or machining methods, HWMP only deposits stiffeners layer-by-layer onto an existing thin plate, followed by minor milling of the irregular surfaces, which provides the possibility to significantly improve material utilization and efficiency without any loss of surface quality. In this paper, the key performances of HWMP in terms of surface quality, material utilization and efficiency are evaluated systematically, which are the results of the comprehensive effects of the deposition parameters (e.g., travel speed, wire-feed rate) and the milling parameters (e.g., spindle speed, tool-feed rate). In order to maximize its performances, the optimization is also performed to find the best combination of the deposition and the milling parameters. The case study shows that HWMP with the optimal process parameters improves the material utilization by 57% and the efficiency by 32% compared against the traditional machining method. Thus, HWMP is believed to be a more environmental friendly and sustainable method for the fabrication of stiffened panels or other similar structures.},

ABSTRACT = {We describe the novel, multiply gaited, vectored water-jet, hybrid locomotion-capable, amphibious spherical robot III (termed ASR-III) featuring a wheel-legged, water-jet composite driving system incorporating a lifting and supporting wheel mechanism (LSWM) and mechanical legs with a water-jet thruster. The LSWM allows the ASR-III to support the body and slide flexibly on smooth (flat) terrain. The composite driving system facilitates two on-land locomotion modes (sliding and walking) and underwater locomotion mode with vectored thrusters, improving adaptability to the amphibious environment. Sliding locomotion improves the stability and maneuverability of ASR-III on smooth flat terrain, whereas walking locomotion allows ASR-III to conquer rough terrain. We used both forward and reverse kinematic models to evaluate the walking and sliding gait efficiency. The robot can also realize underwater locomotion with four vectored water-jet thrusters, and is capable of forward motion, heading angle control and depth control. We evaluated LSWM efficiency and the sliding velocities associated with varying extensions of the LSWM. To explore gait stability and mobility, we performed on-land experiments on smooth flat terrain to define the optimal stride length and frequency. We also evaluated the efficacy of waypoint tracking when the sliding gait was employed, using a closed-loop proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control mechanism. Moreover, experiments of forward locomotion, heading angle control and depth control were conducted to verify the underwater performance of ASR-III. Comparison of the previous robot and ASR-III demonstrated the ASR-III had better amphibious motion performance.},

ABSTRACT = {Wire and arc-based additive manufacturing (WAAM) is a rapidly developing technology which employs a welding arc to melt metal wire for additive manufacturing purposes. During WAAM of thin-walled structures, as the wall height increases, the heat dissipation to the substrate is slowed down gradually and so is the solidification of the molten pool, leading to variation of the bead geometry. Though gradually reducing the heat input via adjusting the process parameters can alleviate this issue, as suggested by previous studies, it relies on experience to a large extent and inevitably sacrifices the deposition rate because the wire feed rate is directly coupled with the heat input. This study introduces for the first time an in-process active cooling system based on thermoelectric cooling technology into WAAM, which aims to eliminate the difference in heat dissipation between upper and lower layers. The case study shows that, with the aid of thermoelectric cooling, the bead width error is reduced by 56.8%, the total fabrication time is reduced by 60.9%, and the average grain size is refined by 25%. The proposed technique provides new insight into bead geometry regulation during WAAM with various benefits in terms of geometric accuracy, productivity, and microstructure.},

ABSTRACT = {Human-robot collaboration (HRC) is a complex procedure in manufacturing due to the problems posed by compatibility and operational safety among humans and robots, and by task definitions among them in a collaborative order. In this paper, the research results of the human-robot collaboration study for the case of an automotive brake disc assembly is presented. The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is proposed as a decision-making method for the human-robot collaboration system, and detailed hierarchical task analysis (HTA) is applied to allocate operational tasks to humans and robots, thus reducing the chance of duty interference. Additionally, a virtual environment software (Tecnomatix Process Simulate, version 11.1,80, Siemens, Munich, BY, Germany, 2012) is used to model the assembly workstation, providing an opportunity to evaluate the feasibility of the process through different scenarios. Finally, an experimental test is conducted to evaluate the performance of the assembly procedure. This research proves that, although human-robot collaboration increases the total process time slightly, this collaboration improves human ergonomics considerably and reduces the operator injury risk.},

ABSTRACT = {With the challenge of transportation environment, a large amount of attention is paid to sustainable mobility worldwide, thus bringing the problem of the evaluation of sustainable transport solutions. In this paper, a modified method based on analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and Dempster–Shafer evidence theory (D-S theory) is proposed for evaluating the impact of transport measures on city sustainability. AHP is adapted to determine the weight of sustainability criteria while D-S theory is used for data fusion of the sustainability assessment. A Transport Sustainability Index (TSI) is presented as a primary measure to determine whether transport solutions have a positive impact on city sustainability. A case study of car-sharing is illustrated to show the efficiency of our proposed method. Our modified method has two desirable properties. One is that the BPA is generated with a new modification framework of evaluation levels, which can flexibly manage uncertain information. The other is that the modified method has excellent performance in sensitivity analysis.},

ABSTRACT = {With the coming of the 4th industrial revolution era, manufacturers produce high-tech products. As the production process is refined, inspection technologies become more important. Specifically, the inspection of a printed circuit board (PCB), which is an indispensable part of electronic products, is an essential step to improve the quality of the process and yield. Image processing techniques are utilized for inspection, but there are limitations because the backgrounds of images are different and the kinds of defects increase. In order to overcome these limitations, methods based on machine learning have been used recently. These methods can inspect without a normal image by learning fault patterns. Therefore, this paper proposes a method can detect various types of defects using machine learning. The proposed method first extracts features through speeded-up robust features (SURF), then learns the fault pattern and calculates probabilities. After that, we generate a weighted kernel density estimation (WKDE) map weighted by the probabilities to consider the density of the features. Because the probability of the WKDE map can detect an area where the defects are concentrated, it improves the performance of the inspection. To verify the proposed method, we apply the method to PCB images and confirm the performance of the method.},

ABSTRACT = {Rail surface defects seriously affect the safety of railway systems. At present, human inspection and rail vehicle inspection are the main approaches for the detection of rail surface defects. However, there are many shortcomings to these approaches, such as low efficiency, high cost, and so on. This paper presents a novel visual inspection approach based on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images, and focuses on two key issues of UAV-based rail images: image enhancement and defects segmentation. With regards to the first aspect, a novel image enhancement algorithm named Local Weber-like Contrast (LWLC) is proposed to enhance rail images. The rail surface defects and backgrounds can be highlighted and homogenized under various sunlight intensity by LWLC, due to its illuminance independent, local nonlinear and other advantages. With regards to the second, a new threshold segmentation method named gray stretch maximum entropy (GSME) is presented in this paper. The proposed GSME method emphasizes gray stretch and de-noising on UAV-based rail images, and selects an optimal segmentation threshold for defects detection. Two visual comparison experiments were carried out to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed methods. Finally, a quantitative comparison experiment shows the LWLC-GSME model achieves a recall of 93.75% for T-I defects and of 94.26% for T-II defects. Therefore, LWLC for image enhancement, in conjunction with GSME for defects segmentation, is efficient and feasible for the detection of rail surface defects based on UAV Images.},

ABSTRACT = {The objective of this research is introduce a new machine learning ensemble approach that is a hybridization of Bagging ensemble (BE) and Logistic Model Trees (LMTree), named as BE-LMtree, for improving the performance of the landslide susceptibility model. The LMTree is a relatively new machine learning algorithm that was rarely explored for landslide study, whereas BE is an ensemble framework that has proven highly efficient for landslide modeling. Upper Reaches Area of Red River Basin (URRB) in Northwest region of Viet Nam was employed as a case study. For this work, a GIS database for the URRB area has been established, which contains a total of 255 landslide polygons and eight predisposing factors i.e., slope, aspect, elevation, land cover, soil type, lithology, distance to fault, and distance to river. The database was then used to construct and validate the proposed BE-LMTree model. Quality of the final BE-LMTree model was checked using confusion matrix and a set of statistical measures. The result showed that the performance of the proposed BE-LMTree model is high with the classification accuracy is 93.81% on the training dataset and the prediction capability is 83.4% on the on the validation dataset. When compared to the support vector machine model and the LMTree model, the proposed BE-LMTree model performs better; therefore, we concluded that the BE-LMTree could prove to be a new efficient tool that should be used for landslide modeling. This research could provide useful results for landslide modeling in landslide prone areas.},

ABSTRACT = {In data-driven methods for prognostics, the remaining useful lifetime (RUL) is predicted based on the health indicator (HI). The HI detects the condition of equipment or components by monitoring sensor data such as vibration signals. To construct the HI, multiple features are extracted from signals using time domain, frequency domain, and time–frequency domain analyses, and which are then fused. However, the process of selecting and fusing features for the HI is very complex and labor-intensive. We propose a novel time–frequency image feature to construct HI and predict the RUL. To convert the one-dimensional vibration signals to a two-dimensional (2-D) image, the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) extracts the time–frequency image features, i.e., the wavelet power spectrum. Then, the obtained image features are fed into a 2-D convolutional neural network (CNN) to construct the HI. The estimated HI from the proposed model is used for the RUL prediction. The accuracy of the RUL prediction is improved by using the image features. The proposed method compresses the complex process including feature extraction, selection, and fusion into a single algorithm by adopting a deep learning approach. The proposed method is validated using a bearing dataset provided by PRONOSTIA. The results demonstrate that the proposed method is superior to related studies using the same dataset.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper proposes “An Integrated Self-diagnosis System (ISS) for an Autonomous Vehicle based on an Internet of Things (IoT) Gateway and Deep Learning” that collects information from the sensors of an autonomous vehicle, diagnoses itself, and the influence between its parts by using Deep Learning and informs the driver of the result. The ISS consists of three modules. The first In-Vehicle Gateway Module (In-VGM) collects the data from the in-vehicle sensors, consisting of media data like a black box, driving radar, and the control messages of the vehicle, and transfers each of the data collected through each Controller Area Network (CAN), FlexRay, and Media Oriented Systems Transport (MOST) protocols to the on-board diagnostics (OBD) or the actuators. The data collected from the in-vehicle sensors is transferred to the CAN or FlexRay protocol and the media data collected while driving is transferred to the MOST protocol. Various types of messages transferred are transformed into a destination protocol message type. The second Optimized Deep Learning Module (ODLM) creates the Training Dataset on the basis of the data collected from the in-vehicle sensors and reasons the risk of the vehicle parts and consumables and the risk of the other parts influenced by a defective part. It diagnoses the vehicle’s total condition risk. The third Data Processing Module (DPM) is based on Edge Computing and has an Edge Computing based Self-diagnosis Service (ECSS) to improve the self-diagnosis speed and reduce the system overhead, while a V2X based Accident Notification Service (VANS) informs the adjacent vehicles and infrastructures of the self-diagnosis result analyzed by the OBD. This paper improves upon the simultaneous message transmission efficiency through the In-VGM by 15.25% and diminishes the learning error rate of a Neural Network algorithm through the ODLM by about 5.5%. Therefore, in addition, by transferring the self-diagnosis information and by managing the time to replace the car parts of an autonomous driving vehicle safely, this reduces loss of life and overall cost.},

ABSTRACT = {Gully erosion triggers land degradation and restricts the use of land. This study assesses the spatial relationship between gully erosion (GE) and geo-environmental variables (GEVs) using Weights-of-Evidence (WoE) Bayes theory, and then applies three data mining methods—Random Forest (RF), boosted regression tree (BRT), and multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS)—for gully erosion susceptibility mapping (GESM) in the Shahroud watershed, Iran. Gully locations were identified by extensive field surveys, and a total of 172 GE locations were mapped. Twelve gully-related GEVs: Elevation, slope degree, slope aspect, plan curvature, convergence index, topographic wetness index (TWI), lithology, land use/land cover (LU/LC), distance from rivers, distance from roads, drainage density, and NDVI were selected to model GE. The results of variables importance by RF and BRT models indicated that distance from road, elevation, and lithology had the highest effect on GE occurrence. The area under the curve (AUC) and seed cell area index (SCAI) methods were used to validate the three GE maps. The results showed that AUC for the three models varies from 0.911 to 0.927, whereas the RF model had a prediction accuracy of 0.927 as per SCAI values, when compared to the other models. The findings will be of help for planning and developing the studied region.},

ABSTRACT = {The Johnson–Holmquist-II(JH-2) model is introduced as the constitutive model for rock materials in tunnel smooth blasting. However, complicated and/or high-cost experiments need to be carried out to obtain the parameters of the JH-2 constitutive model. This study chooses Barre granite as an example to propose a quick and convenient determination method for the parameters of the JH-2 model using a series of computational and extrapolated methods. The validity of the parameters is verified via comparing the results of 3D numerical simulations with laboratory blast-loading experiments. Subsequently, the verified parameter determination method, together with the JH-2 damage constitutive model, is applied in the numerical simulation of smooth blasting in Zigaojian tunnel, Hangzhou–Huangshan high-speed railway. The overbreak/underbreak induced by rock blasting and joints/discontinuities is well estimated through comparing the damage contours resulting from the numerical study with the tunnel profiles measured from the tunnel site. The peak particle velocities (PPVs) of the near field are extracted to estimate the damage scope and damage degree for the surrounding rock mass of the tunnel on the basis of PPV damage criteria. This method can be used in the excavation of rock tunnels subjected to large strains, high strain rates, and high pressures, thereby reducing safety risk and economic losses.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, discrete orthonormal Stockwell transform (DOST)-based vibration imaging is proposed as a preprocessing step for supporting load and rotational speed invariant scenarios for signals of various health conditions. For any health condition, features can easily be extracted from its generated health pattern. To automate the feature selection process, a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based transfer learning (TL) approach for diagnosis has also been introduced. Transfer learning allows an established model to use feature knowledge obtained under one set of working conditions through hidden layers to diagnose faults that occur under other working conditions. The network learns from the massive source dataset, and that knowledge is applied to the target data to identify faults. Using the bearing dataset of Case Western Reserve University, the proposed approach yields an average 99.8% classification accuracy and, specifically, 99.99% for healthy condition (HC), 99.95% for inner race fault (IRF), 99.96% for ball fault (BF), 99.68% for outer race fault for 12 o’clock sensor position (ORF@12), 99.93% for outer race fault for 3 o’clock sensor position (ORF@3), and 99.89% for outer race fault for 6 o’clock sensor position (ORF@6). In this paper, the proposed approach is compared with conventional artificial neural networks (ANNs), support vector machines (SVMs), hierarchical CNNs, and deep autoencoders. The proposed approach outperforms these conventional methods in the accuracy under all working conditions.},

ABSTRACT = {In this study, the natural convection of a magnetohydrodynamic nanofluid in an enclosure under the effects of thermal radiation and the shape factor of nanoparticles was analyzed numerically using the control-volume-based finite element method (CVFEM). Columns, spheres, and lamina are examples of the nanoparticle shapes used in the investigation. The study of nanofluid flow and heat transfer was accomplished with an extensive range of nanofluid volume fractions, radiation parameters, Hartmann numbers, Rayleigh numbers, and nanoparticle shape factors. Also, the correlation between the average Nusselt number and the influencing parameters of the current study was determined. The findings demonstrate that laminar nanoparticles have a more notable impact on the average and local Nusselt numbers than the other nanoparticle shapes.},

ABSTRACT = {Prognostics, such as remaining useful life (RUL) prediction, is a crucial task in condition-based maintenance. A major challenge in data-driven prognostics is the difficulty of obtaining a sufficient number of samples of failure progression. However, for traditional machine learning methods and deep neural networks, enough training data is a prerequisite to train good prediction models. In this work, we proposed a transfer learning algorithm based on Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (BLSTM) recurrent neural networks for RUL estimation, in which the models can be first trained on different but related datasets and then fine-tuned by the target dataset. Extensive experimental results show that transfer learning can in general improve the prediction models on the dataset with a small number of samples. There is one exception that when transferring from multi-type operating conditions to single operating conditions, transfer learning led to a worse result.},

ABSTRACT = {Most faults can stop a motor, and time is lost in fixing the damaged motor. This is a reason why it is essential to develop fault-detection methods. This paper describes the acoustic-based fault detection of two commutator motors: the commutator motor of an electric impact drill and the commutator motor of a blender. Acoustic signals were recorded by a smartphone. Five states of the electric impact drill and three states of the blender were analysed: for the electric impact drill, these states were healthy, damaged gear train, faulty fan with five broken rotor blades, faulty fan with 10 broken rotor blades, and shifted brush (motor off); for the blender, these states were healthy, faulty fan with two broken rotor blades, and faulty fan with five broken rotor blades. A feature extraction method, MSAF-RATIO-27-MULTIEXPANDED-4-GROUPS (Method of Selection of Amplitudes of Frequency Ratio of 27% Multiexpanded 4 Groups), was developed and used for the computation of feature vectors. The nearest mean (NM) and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers were used for data classification. Analysis of the recognition of acoustic signals was carried out. The analysed value of TEEID (the total efficiency of recognition of the electric impact drill) was equal to 96% for the NM classifier and 88.8% for SVM. The analysed value of TEB (the total efficiency of recognition of the blender) was equal to 100% for the NM classifier and 94.11% for SVM.},

The results showed that the areas under the curve obtained using the WoE, WoE-LR, and WoE-RF methods were 0.720, 0.773, and 0.802 for the training dataset, and were 0.695, 0.763, and 0.782 for the validation dataset, respectively. The results demonstrate the superiority of hybrid models and that the resultant maps would be useful for land use planning in landslide-prone areas.},

ABSTRACT = {As a new low volume application technology, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) application is developing quickly in China. The aim of this study was to compare the droplet deposition, control efficacy and working efficiency of a six-rotor UAV with a self-propelled boom sprayer and two conventional knapsack sprayers on the wheat crop. The total deposition of UAV and other sprayers were not statistically significant, but significantly lower for run-off. The deposition uniformity and droplets penetrability of the UAV were poor. The deposition variation coefficient of the UAV was 87.2%, which was higher than the boom sprayer of 31.2%. The deposition on the third top leaf was only 50.0% compared to the boom sprayer. The area of coverage of the UAV was 2.2% under the spray volume of 10 L/ha. The control efficacy on wheat aphids of UAV was 70.9%, which was comparable to other sprayers. The working efficiency of UAV was 4.11 ha/h, which was roughly 1.7–20.0 times higher than the three other sprayers. Comparable control efficacy results suggest that UAV application could be a viable strategy to control pests with higher efficiency. Further improvement on deposition uniformity and penetrability are needed.},

ABSTRACT = {A methodology aiming to predict the vulnerability of masonry structures under seismic action is presented herein. Masonry structures, among which many are cultural heritage assets, present high vulnerability under earthquake. Reliable simulations of their response to seismic stresses are exceedingly difficult because of the complexity of the structural system and the anisotropic and brittle behavior of the masonry materials. Furthermore, the majority of the parameters involved in the problem such as the masonry material mechanical characteristics and earthquake loading characteristics have a stochastic-probabilistic nature. Within this framework, a detailed analytical methodological approach for assessing the seismic vulnerability of masonry historical and monumental structures is presented, taking into account the probabilistic nature of the input parameters by means of analytically determining fragility curves. The emerged methodology is presented in detail through application on theoretical and built cultural heritage real masonry structures.},

ABSTRACT = {Traffic emissions are considered one of the leading causes of environmental impact in megacities and their dangerous effects on human health. This paper presents a hybrid model based on data mining and GIS models designed to predict vehicular Carbon Monoxide (CO) emitted from traffic on the New Klang Valley Expressway, Malaysia. The hybrid model was developed based on the integration of GIS and the optimized Artificial Neural Network algorithm that combined with the Correlation based Feature Selection (CFS) algorithm to predict the daily vehicular CO emissions and generate prediction maps at a microscale level in a small urban area by using a field survey and open source data, which are the main contributions to this paper. The other contribution is related to the case study, which represents the spatial and quantitative variations in the vehicular CO emissions between toll plaza areas and road networks. The proposed hybrid model consists of three steps: the first step is the implementation of the correlation-based Feature Selection model to select the best model’s predictors; the second step is the prediction of vehicular CO by using a multilayer perceptron neural network model; and the third step is the creation of micro scale prediction maps. The model was developed using six traffic CO predictors: number of vehicles, number of heavy vehicles, number of motorbikes, temperature, wind speed and a digital surface model. The network architecture and its hyperparameters were optimized through a grid search approach. The traffic CO concentrations were observed at 15-min intervals on weekends and weekdays, four times per day. The results showed that the developed model had achieved validation accuracy of 80.6 %. Overall, the developed models are found to be promising tools for vehicular CO simulations in highly congested areas.},

ABSTRACT = {In view of the importance of accurately measuring the relative density of a selective laser melted (SLMed) part for optimizing the selective laser melting (SLM) processing parameters, suitable procedures of the Archimedes method considering the surface-connected cavities were proposed by comparing the results using the Archimedes method with image analysis. The effects of the SLM processing parameters on the relative density of AlSi10Mg were investigated using the proposed procedures of the Archimedes methods and image analysis. Fourteen SLMed samples were produced by different SLM processing parameters according to Doehlert Matrix. The regression models correlating relative density and three SLM processing parameters (laser power, scan speed, and hatching distance) were built and the optimum parameter combination to get a high relative density was obtained. By plotting the response surfaces and contours of the regression models, it was found that the relative densities are both higher at the combination of the higher scan speed, higher power, and lower hatching distance and at the combination of a lower scan speed, a moderate laser power, and a optional hatching distance. It was also found that the parameter of hatching distance is the crucial parameter to get a high relative density and to get high mechanical property.},

ABSTRACT = {Electrical winding faults, namely stator short-circuits and rotor bar damage, in total constitute around 50% of all faults of induction motors (IMs) applied in variable speed drives (VSD). In particular, the short circuits of stator windings are recognized as one of the most difficult failures to detect because their detection makes sense only at the initial stage of the damage. Well-known symptoms of stator and rotor winding failures can be visible in the stator current spectra; however, the detection and classification of motor windings faults usually require the knowledge of human experts. Nowadays, artificial intelligence methods are also used in fault recognition. This paper presents the results of experimental research on the application of the stator current symptoms of the converter-fed induction motor drive to electrical fault detection and classification using Kohonen neural networks. The experimental tests of a diagnostic setup based on a virtual measurement and data pre-processing system, designed in LabView, are described. It has been shown that the developed neural detectors and classifiers based on self-organizing Kohonen maps, trained with the instantaneous symmetrical components of the stator current spectra (ISCA), enable automatic distinguishing between the stator and rotor winding faults for supplying various voltage frequencies and load torque values.},

ABSTRACT = {Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images that can provide thematic information at much higher spatial and temporal resolutions than satellite images have great potential in crop classification. Due to the ultra-high spatial resolution of UAV images, spatial contextual information such as texture is often used for crop classification. From a data availability viewpoint, it is not always possible to acquire time-series UAV images due to limited accessibility to the study area. Thus, it is necessary to improve classification performance for situations when a single or minimum number of UAV images are available for crop classification. In this study, we investigate the potential of gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM)-based texture information for crop classification with time-series UAV images and machine learning classifiers including random forest and support vector machine. In particular, the impact of combining texture and spectral information on the classification performance is evaluated for cases that use only one UAV image or multi-temporal images as input. A case study of crop classification in Anbandegi of Korea was conducted for the above comparisons. The best classification accuracy was achieved when multi-temporal UAV images which can fully account for the growth cycles of crops were combined with GLCM-based texture features. However, the impact of the utilization of texture information was not significant. In contrast, when one August UAV image was used for crop classification, the utilization of texture information significantly affected the classification performance. Classification using texture features extracted from GLCM with larger kernel size significantly improved classification accuracy, an improvement of 7.72%p in overall accuracy for the support vector machine classifier, compared with classification based solely on spectral information. These results indicate the usefulness of texture information for classification of ultra-high-spatial-resolution UAV images, particularly when acquisition of time-series UAV images is difficult and only one UAV image is used for crop classification.},

ABSTRACT = {Cellular materials have been used in many applications such as insulation, packaging, and protective gear. Expanded polystyrene has been widely used as energy-absorbing liner in helmets due to its excellent cost-benefit relation. This synthetic material can absorb reasonable amounts of energy via permanent deformation. However, in real-world accidents, helmets may be subjected to multi-impact scenarios. Additionally, oil-derived plastic is presently a major source of societal concern regarding pollution and waste. As a sustainable alternative, cork is a natural cellular material with great crashworthiness properties and it has the remarkable capacity to recover after compression, due to its viscoelastic behavior, which is a desired characteristic in multi-impact applications. Therefore, the main goal is to analyze the applicability of agglomerated cork as padding material in safety helmets. First, a finite element model of a motorcycle helmet available on the market was developed to assess its safety performance and to establish a direct comparison between expanded polystyrene and cork agglomerates as liners. Secondly, a new helmet model with a generic geometry was developed to assess the applicability of agglomerated cork as liner for different types of helmets, based on the head injury risk predictions by the finite element head model, YEt Another Head Model (YEAHM), developed by the authors. Several versions of helmet liners were created by varying its thickness and removing sections of material. In other words, this generic helmet was optimized by carrying out a parametric study, and by comparing its performance under double impacts. The results from these tests indicate that agglomerated cork liners are an excellent alternative to the synthetic ones. Thus, agglomerated cork can be employed in protective gear, improving its overall performance and capacity to withstand multi-impacts.},

ABSTRACT = {Multi-material additive manufacturing offers new design freedom for functional integration and opens new possibilities in innovative part design, for instance, a local integration of electrically conductive structures or heat radiant surfaces. Detailed experimental investigations on materials with three different fillers (carbon black (CB), carbon nanotubes (CNT) and nano copper wires) were conducted to identify process-specific influencing factors on electrical conductivity and resistive heating. In this regard, raster angle orientation, extrusion temperature, speed and flow rate were investigated. A variation of the raster angle (0°, ±45°, and 90°) shows the highest influence on resistivity. An angle of 0° had the lowest electrical resistance and the highest temperature increase due to resistive heating. The material filled with nano copper wires showed the highest electrical conductivity followed by the CNT filled material and materials filled with CB. Both current–voltage characteristics and voltage-dependent heat distribution of the surface temperature were determined by using a thermographic camera. The highest temperature increase was achieved by the CNT filled material. The materials filled with CB and nano copper wires showed increased electrical resistance depending on temperature. Based on the experiments, solution principles and design rules for additively manufactured electrically conductive structures are derived.},

ABSTRACT = {In face milling one of the most important parameters of the process quality is the roughness of the machined surface. In many articles, the influence of cutting regimes on the roughness and cutting forces of face milling is considered. However, during flat face milling with the milling width B lower than the cutter’s diameter D, the influence of such an important parameter as the relative position of the face mill towards the workpiece and the milling kinematics (Up or Down milling) on the cutting force components and the roughness of the machined surface has not been sufficiently studied. At the same time, the values of the cutting force components can vary significantly depending on the relative position of the face mill towards the workpiece, and thus have a different effect on the power expended on the milling process. Having studied this influence, it is possible to formulate useful recommendations for a technologist who creates a technological process using face milling operations. It is possible to choose such a relative position of the face mill and workpiece that will provide the smallest value of the surface roughness obtained by face milling. This paper shows the influence of the relative position of the face mill towards the workpiece and milling kinematics on the components of the cutting forces, the acceleration of the machine spindle in the process of face milling (considering the rotation of the mill for a full revolution), and on the surface roughness obtained by face milling. Practical recommendations on the assignment of the relative position of the face mill towards the workpiece and the milling kinematics are given.},

ABSTRACT = {This study aims to analyze and compare landslide susceptibility at Woomyeon Mountain, South Korea, based on the random forest (RF) model and the boosted regression tree (BRT) model. Through the construction of a landslide inventory map, 140 landslide locations were found. Among these, 42 (30%) were reserved to validate the model after 98 (70%) had been selected at random for model training. Fourteen landslide explanatory variables related to topography, hydrology, and forestry factors were considered and selected, based on the results of information gain for the modeling. The results were evaluated and compared using the receiver operating characteristic curve and statistical indices. The analysis showed that the RF model was better than the BRT model. The RF model yielded higher specificity, overall accuracy, and kappa index than the BRT model. In addition, the RF model, with a prediction rate of 0.865, performed slightly better than the BRT model, which had a prediction rate of 0.851. These results indicate that the landslide susceptibility maps (LSMs) produced in this study had good performance for predicting the spatial landslide distribution in the study area. These LSMs could be helpful for establishing mitigation strategies and for land use planning.},

ABSTRACT = {The precise estimation and forecast of the safety factor (SF) in civil engineering applications is considered as an important issue to reduce engineering risk. The present research investigates new artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for the prediction of SF values of retaining walls, as important and resistant structures for ground forces. These structures have complicated performances in dynamic conditions. Consequently, more than 8000 designs of these structures were dynamically evaluated. Two AI models, namely the imperialist competitive algorithm (ICA)-artificial neural network (ANN), and the genetic algorithm (GA)-ANN were used for the forecasting of SF values. In order to design intelligent models, parameters i.e., the wall thickness, stone density, wall height, soil density, and internal soil friction angle were examined under different dynamic conditions and assigned as inputs to predict SF of retaining walls. Various models of these systems were constructed and compared with each other to obtain the best one. Results of models indicated that although both hybrid models are able to predict SF values with a high accuracy and they can be introduced as new models in the field, the retaining wall performance could be properly predicted in dynamic conditions using the ICA-ANN model. Under these conditions, a combination of engineering design and artificial intelligence techniques can be used to control and secure retaining walls in dynamic conditions.},

ABSTRACT = {Geopolymer concrete (GPC) is applied successfully in the construction of civil engineering structures. This outcome confirmed that GPC can be used as an alternative material to conventional ordinary Portland cement concrete (OPC). Recent investigations were attempted to incorporate recycled aggregates into GPC to reduce the use of natural materials such as stone and sand. However, traditional methodology used to predict compressive strength and to find out an optimum mix for GPC is yet to be formulated, especially in cases of GPC using by-products as aggregates. In this study, we propose novel hybrid artificial intelligence (AI) approaches, namely a particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (PSOANFIS) and a genetic algorithm (GA)-based adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (GAANFIS) to predict the 28-day compressive strength of GPC containing 100% waste slag aggregates. To construct and validate these models, 21 different mixes with 210 specimens were casted and tested. Three input parameters were used to predict the tested compressive strength of GPC, i.e., the sodium solution (NaOH) concentration (varied from 10 to 14 M), the mass ratio of alkaline activation solution to fly ash (AAS/FA), ranging from 0.4 to 0.5, and the mass ratio of sodium silicate (Na2SiO3) to sodium hydroxide solution (SS/SH) which was varied from 2 to 3. The compressive strength of the fabricated GPC was used as output parameter for the prediction models. Validation of the models was done using several statistical criteria such as mean absolute error (MAE), root-mean-square error (RMSE), and correlation coefficient (R). The results show that the PSOANFIS and GAANFIS models have strong potential for predicting the 28-day compressive strength of GPC, but the PSOANFIS (MAE = 1.847 MPa, RMSE = 2.251 MPa, and R = 0.934) was slightly better than the GAANFIS (MAE = 2.115 MPa, RMSE = 2.531 MPa, and R = 0.927). This study will help in reducing the time and cost for the implementation of laboratory experiments in designing the optimum proportions of GPC.},

ABSTRACT = {To effectively prevent land subsidence over abandoned coal mines, it is necessary to quantitatively identify vulnerable areas. In this study, we evaluated the performance of predictive Bayesian, functional, and meta-ensemble machine learning models in generating land subsidence susceptibility (LSS) maps. All models were trained using half of a land subsidence inventory, and validated using the other half of the dataset. The model performance was evaluated by comparing the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of the resulting LSS map for each model. Among all models tested, the logit boost, which is a meta-ensemble machine leaning model, generated LSS maps with the highest accuracy (91.44%), i.e., higher than that of the other Bayesian and functional machine learning models, including the Bayes net (86.42%), naïve Bayes (85.39%), logistic (88.92%), and multilayer perceptron models (86.76%). The LSS maps produced in this study can be used to mitigate subsidence risk for people and important facilities within the study area, and as a foundation for further studies in other regions.},

ABSTRACT = {Additive manufacturing provides a number of benefits in terms of infinite freedom to design complex parts and reduced lead-times while globally reducing the size of supply chains as it brings all production processes under one roof. However, additive manufacturing (AM) lags far behind conventional manufacturing in terms of surface quality. This proves a hindrance for many companies considering investment in AM. The aim of this work is to investigate the effect of varying process parameters on the resultant roughness of the down-facing surfaces in selective laser melting (SLM). A systematic experimental study was carried out and the effects of the interaction of the different parameters and their effect on the surface roughness (Sa) were analyzed. It was found that the interaction and interdependency between parameters were of greatest significance to the obtainable surface roughness, though their effects vary greatly depending on the applied levels. This behavior was mainly attributed to the difference in energy absorbed by the powder. Predictive process models for optimization of process parameters for minimizing the obtained Sa in 45° and 35° down-facing surface, individually, were achieved with average error percentages of 5% and 6.3%, respectively, however further investigation is still warranted.},

ABSTRACT = {Path tracking of mining vehicles plays a significant role in reducing the working time of operators in the underground environment. Because the existing path tracking control of mining vehicles, based on model predictive control, is not very effective when the longitudinal velocity of the vehicle is above 2 m/s, we have devised a new controller based on nonlinear model predictive control. Then, we compare this new controller with the existing model predictive controller. In the results of our simulation, the tracking accuracy of our controller at the longitudinal velocity of 4 m/s is close to that of the existing model predictive controller, at the longitudinal velocity of 2 m/s. When longitudinal velocity is 4 m/s, the existing model predictive controller cannot drive the mining vehicle to track the given path, but our nonlinear model predictive controller can, and the maximum displacement error and heading error are 0.1382 m and 0.0589 rad, respectively. According to these results, we believe that this nonlinear model predictive controller can be used to improve the performance of the path tracking of mining vehicles.},

ABSTRACT = {The shear strength of rockfill materials (RFM) is an important engineering parameter in the design and audit of geotechnical structures. In this paper, the predictive reliability and feasibility of random forests and Cubist models were analyzed by estimating the shear strength from the relative density, particle size, distribution (gradation), material hardness, gradation and fineness modulus, and confining (normal) stress. For this purpose, case studies of 165 rockfill samples have been applied to generate training and testing datasets to construct and validate the models. Thirteen key material properties for rockfill characterization were selected to develop the proposed models. Validation and comparison of the models have been performed using the root mean square error (RMSE), coefficient of determination (R2), and mean estimation error (MAE) between the measured and estimated values. A sensitivity analysis was also conducted to ascertain the importance of various inputs in the prediction of the output. The results demonstrated that the Cubist model has the highest prediction performance with (RMSE = 0.0959, R2 = 0.9697 and MAE = 0.0671), followed by the random forests model with (RMSE = 0.1133, R2 = 0.9548 and MAE= 0.0665), the artificial neural network (ANN) model with (RMSE = 0.1320, R2 = 0.9386 and MAE = 0.0841), and the conventional multiple linear regression technique with (RMSE = 0.1361, R2 = 0.9345 and MAE = 0.0888). The results indicated that the Cubist and random forests models are able to generate better predictive results of the shear strength of RFM than ANN and conventional regression models. The Cubist model was considered to be more promising for interpreting the complex relationships between the influential properties of RFM and the shear strengths of RFM to some extent, which can be extremely helpful in estimating the shear strength of rockfill materials.},

ABSTRACT = {Carbon- and glass fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP and GFRP) composite materials have been used in many industries such as aerospace and automobile because of their outstanding strength-to-weight ratio and corrosion resistance. The quality of these materials is important for safe operation. Nondestructive testing (NDT) techniques are an effective way to inspect these composites. While ultrasonic NDT has previously been used for inspection of composites, conventional ultrasonic NDT, using single element transducers, has limitations such as high attenuation and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Using phased array ultrasonic testing (PAUT) techniques, signals can be generated at desired distances and angles. These capabilities provide promising results for composites where the anisotropic structure makes signal evaluation challenging. Defect detection in composites based on bulk and guided waves are studied. The capability of the PAUT and its sensitivity to flaws were evaluated by comparing the signal characteristics to the conventional method. The results show that flaw sizes as small as 0.8 mm with penetration depth up to 25 mm can be detected using PAUT, and the result signals have better characteristics than the conventional ultrasonic technique. In addition, it has been shown that guided wave generated by PAUT also has outstanding capability of flaw detection in composite materials.},

ABSTRACT = {Cooperative behaviors in multi-robot systems emerge as an excellent alternative for collaboration in search and rescue tasks to accelerate the finding survivors process and avoid risking additional lives. Although there are still several challenges to be solved, such as communication between agents, power autonomy, navigation strategies, and detection and classification of survivors, among others. The research work presented by this paper focuses on the navigation of the robot swarm and the consensus of the agents applied to the victims detection. The navigation strategy is based on the application of particle swarm theory, where the robots are the agents of the swarm. The attraction and repulsion forces that are typical in swarm particle systems are used by the multi-robot system to avoid obstacles, keep group compact and navigate to a target location. The victims are detected by each agent separately, however, once the agents agree on the existence of a possible victim, these agents separate from the general swarm by creating a sub-swarm. The sub-swarm agents use a modified rendezvous consensus algorithm to perform a formation control around the possible victims and then carry out a consensus of the information acquired by the sensors with the aim to determine the victim existence. Several experiments were conducted to test navigation, obstacle avoidance, and search for victims. Additionally, different situations were simulated with the consensus algorithm. The results show how swarm theory allows the multi-robot system navigates avoiding obstacles, finding possible victims, and settling down their possible use in search and rescue operations.},

ABSTRACT = {The construction industry is infamous for a high number of fatalities around the world. The Hong Kong construction industry is also one of the most hazardous industries for worker’s safety compared to all other industries. This paper presents a current trend of occupational injuries among Hong Kong construction workers. Yearly reports of the labour department of Hong Kong were evaluated in this study. A statistical analysis of incidence rates (IRs) and mortality rates (MRs) was performed to evaluate each accident type. Moreover, analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to find out the relationship between IRs and MRs of individual accident type. From the analysis, “Slip, trip or fall on the same level” caused the higher number of occupational injuries while “fall of the person from height” caused the higher number of occupational fatalities from 2011 to 2017. Finally, the future perspectives of effective safety management system incorporated with advance technologies in the construction industry are highlighted in this study.},

ABSTRACT = {Quadcopter unmanned aerial vehicles continue to play important roles in several applications and the improvement of their control performance has been explored in a great number of studies. In this paper, we present an altitude control algorithm for quadcopters that consists of a combination of nonlinear and linear controllers. The smooth transition between the nonlinear and linear modes are guaranteed through controller gains that are obtained based on mathematical analysis. The proposed controller takes advantage and addresses some known shortcomings of the conventional proportional–integral–derivative control method. The algorithm is simple to implement, and we prove its stability through the Lyapunov theory. By prescribing certain flight conditions, we use numerical simulations to compare the control performance of our control method to that of a conventional proportional–derivative–integral approach. Furthermore, we use a DJI-F450 drone equipped with a laser ranging sensor as the experimental quadcopter platform to evaluate the performance of our new controller in real flight conditions. Numerical simulation and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

ABSTRACT = {The main aim of this study is to develop different hybrid artificial intelligence (AI) approaches, such as an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and two ANFISs optimized by metaheuristic techniques, namely simulated annealing (SA) and biogeography-based optimization (BBO) for predicting the critical buckling load of structural members under compression, taking into account the influence of initial geometric imperfections. With this aim, the existing results of compression tests on steel columns were collected and used as a dataset. Eleven input parameters, representing the slenderness ratios and initial geometric imperfections, were considered. The predicted target was the critical buckling load of columns. Statistical criteria, namely the correlation coefficient (R), the root mean squared error (RMSE), and the mean absolute error (MAE) were used to evaluate and validate the three proposed AI models. The results showed that SA and BBO were able to improve the prediction performance of the original ANFIS. Excellent results using the BBO optimization technique were achieved (i.e., an increase in R by 7.15%, RMSE by 40.48%, and MAE by 38.45%), and those using the SA technique were not much different (i.e., an increase in R by 5.03%, RMSE by 26.68%, and MAE by 20.40%). Finally, sensitivity analysis was performed, and the most important imperfections affecting column buckling capacity was found to be the initial in-plane loading eccentricity at the top and bottom ends of the columns. The methodology and the developed AI models herein could pave the way to establishing an advanced approach to forecasting damages of columns under compression.},

ABSTRACT = {There is a large amount of useful information from past experimental tests, which are usually ignored in test-setup for the new ones. Variation of assumptions, materials, test procedures, and test objectives make it difficult to choose the right model for validation of the numerical models. Results from different experiments are sometimes in conflict with each other, or have minimum correlation. Furthermore, not all these information are easily accessible for researchers and engineers. Therefore, this paper presents the results of a comprehensive study on different experimental models for steel plate and reinforced concrete shear walls. A unique library of up to 13 parameters (mechanical properties and geometric characteristics) affecting the strength, stiffness and drift ratio of the shear walls are gathered including their sensitivity analysis. Next, a predictive meta-model is developed based on artificial neural network. It is capable of forecasting the responses for any desired shear wall with good accuracy. The proposed network can be used to as an alternative to the nonlinear numerical simulations or expensive experimental test.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper studies the problem of generating cooperative feasible paths for formation rendezvous of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Cooperative path-planning for multi-UAV formation rendezvous is mostly a complicated multi-objective optimization problem with many coupled constraints. In order to satisfy the kinematic constraints, i.e., the maximum curvature constraint and the requirement of continuous curvature of the UAV path, the Pythagorean hodograph (PH) curve is adopted as the parameterized path because of its curvature continuity and rational intrinsic properties. Inspired by the co-evolutionary theory, a distributed cooperative particle swarm optimization (DCPSO) algorithm with an elite keeping strategy is proposed to generate a flyable and safe path for each UAV. This proposed algorithm can meet the kinematic constraints of UAVs and the cooperation requirements among UAVs. Meanwhile, the optimal or sub-optimal paths can be obtained. Finally, numerical simulations in 2-D and 3-D environments are conducted to demonstrate the feasibility and stability of the proposed algorithm. Simulation results show that the paths generated by the proposed DCPSO can not only meet the kinematic constraints of UAVs and safety requirements, but also achieve the simultaneous arrival and collision avoidance between UAVs for formation rendezvous. Compared with the cooperative co-evolutionary genetic algorithm (CCGA), the proposed DCPSO has better stability and a higher searching success rate.},

ABSTRACT = {Energy-efficiency is one of the critical issues in smart cities. It is an essential basis for optimizing smart cities planning. This study proposed four new artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for forecasting the heating load of buildings’ energy efficiency based on the potential of artificial neural network (ANN) and meta-heuristics algorithms, including artificial bee colony (ABC) optimization, particle swarm optimization (PSO), imperialist competitive algorithm (ICA), and genetic algorithm (GA). They were abbreviated as ABC-ANN, PSO-ANN, ICA-ANN, and GA-ANN models; 837 buildings were considered and analyzed based on the influential parameters, such as glazing area distribution (GLAD), glazing area (GLA), orientation (O), overall height (OH), roof area (RA), wall area (WA), surface area (SA), relative compactness (RC), for estimating heating load (HL). Three statistical criteria, such as root-mean-squared error (RMSE), coefficient determination (R2), and mean absolute error (MAE), were used to assess the potential of the aforementioned models. The results indicated that the GA-ANN model provided the highest performance in estimating the heating load of buildings’ energy efficiency, with an RMSE of 1.625, R2 of 0.980, and MAE of 0.798. The remaining models (i.e., PSO-ANN, ICA-ANN, ABC-ANN) yielded lower performance with RMSE of 1.932, 1.982, 1.878; R2 of 0.972, 0.970, 0.973; MAE of 1.027, 0.980, 0.957, respectively.},

Experimental results were obtained by performing plane-contact sliding tests under non-lubrication conditions on a pin-on-disk tribometer. The specimens were tested both in untreated state with different hardening levels, and after surface treatment of nitrocarburizing. We concluded that wear maps via ANN modeling were a user-friendly approach for the presentation of wear-related information, since they easily permitted the determination of areas under steady-state wear that were appropriate for use. Furthermore, the achieved optimum ANN model seemed to be a simple and helpful design/educational tool, which could assist both in educational seminars, as well as in the interpretation of the surface treatment effects on the tribological performance of tool steels.},

ABSTRACT = {It is crucial to study the axial compression behavior of concrete-filled steel tubular (CFST) columns to ensure the safe operation of engineering structures. The restriction between steel tubular and core concrete in CFSTs is complex and the relationship between geometric and material properties and axial compression behavior is highly nonlinear. These challenges have prompted the use of soft computing methods to predict the ultimate bearing capacity (abbreviated as Nu) under axial compression. Taking the square CFST short column as an example, a mass of experimental data is obtained through axial compression tests. Combined with support vector machine (SVM) and particle swarm optimization (PSO), this paper presents a new method termed PSVM (SVM optimized by PSO) for Nu value prediction. The nonlinear relationship in Nu value prediction is efficiently represented by SVM, and PSO is used to select the model parameters of SVM. The experimental dataset is utilized to verify the reliability of the PSVM model, and the prediction performance of PSVM is compared with that of traditional design methods and other benchmark models. The proposed PSVM model provides a better prediction of the ultimate axial capacity of square CFST short columns. As such, PSVM is an efficient alternative method other than empirical and theoretical formulas.},

ABSTRACT = {We proposed an innovative hybrid intelligent approach, namely, the multiboost based naïve bayes trees (MBNBT) method for the spatial prediction of landslides in the Mu Cang Chai District of Yen Bai Province, Vietnam. The MBNBT, which is an ensemble of the multiboost (MB) and naïve bayes trees (NBT) base classifier, has rarely been applied for landslide susceptibility mapping around the world. For the modeling, we selected 248 landslide locations in the hilly terrain of the study area. Fifteen landslide conditioning factors were selected for the construction of the database based on the one-R attribute evaluation (ORAE) technique. Model validation was done using statistical metrics, namely, sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC). Performance of the hybrid model was evaluated and compared with popular soft computing benchmark models, namely, multiple perceptron neural network (MLPN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and single NBT. Results indicated that the proposed MBNBT (AUC = 0.824) model outperformed the popular models, namely, the MLPN (AUC = 0.804), SVM (AUC = 0.804), and NBT (AUC = 0.800) models. Analysis of the model results also suggested that the MB meta classifier ensemble model could enhance the prediction power of the NBT model. Therefore, the MBNBT is a suitable method for the assessment of landslide susceptibility in landslide prone areas.},

ABSTRACT = {Induction motors are among the most important components of modern machinery and industrial equipment. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a fault diagnosis system that detects the operating conditions of and faults in induction motors early. This paper presents an induction motor fault diagnosis system based on a CNN (convolutional neural network) model. In the proposed method, vibration signal data are obtained from the induction motor experimental environment, and these values are input into the CNN. Then, the CNN performs fault diagnosis. In this study, fault diagnosis of an induction motor is performed in three states, namely, normal, rotor fault, and bearing fault. In addition, a GUI (graphical user interface) for the proposed fault diagnosis system is presented. The experimental results confirm that the proposed method is suitable for diagnosing rotor and bearing faults of induction motors.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper proposes a noble multi-robot path planning algorithm using Deep q learning combined with CNN (Convolution Neural Network) algorithm. In conventional path planning algorithms, robots need to search a comparatively wide area for navigation and move in a predesigned formation under a given environment. Each robot in the multi-robot system is inherently required to navigate independently with collaborating with other robots for efficient performance. In addition, the robot collaboration scheme is highly depends on the conditions of each robot, such as its position and velocity. However, the conventional method does not actively cope with variable situations since each robot has difficulty to recognize the moving robot around it as an obstacle or a cooperative robot. To compensate for these shortcomings, we apply Deep q learning to strengthen the learning algorithm combined with CNN algorithm, which is needed to analyze the situation efficiently. CNN analyzes the exact situation using image information on its environment and the robot navigates based on the situation analyzed through Deep q learning. The simulation results using the proposed algorithm shows the flexible and efficient movement of the robots comparing with conventional methods under various environments.},

ABSTRACT = {The main objective of this study is to develop and compare hybrid Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches, namely Adaptive Network-based Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) optimized by Genetic Algorithm (GAANFIS) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSOANFIS) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) for predicting the Marshall Stability (MS) of Stone Matrix Asphalt (SMA) materials. Other important properties of the SMA, namely Marshall Flow (MF) and Marshall Quotient (MQ) were also predicted using the best model found. With that goal, the SMA samples were fabricated in a local laboratory and used to generate datasets for the modeling. The considered input parameters were coarse and fine aggregates, bitumen content and cellulose. The predicted targets were Marshall Parameters such as MS, MF and MQ. Models performance assessment was evaluated thanks to criteria such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and correlation coefficient (R). A Monte Carlo approach with 1000 simulations was used to deduce the statistical results to assess the performance of the three proposed AI models. The results showed that the SVM is the best predictor regarding the converged statistical criteria and probability density functions of RMSE, MAE and R. The results of this study represent a contribution towards the selection of a suitable AI approach to quickly and accurately determine the Marshall Parameters of SMA mixtures.},

ABSTRACT = {Stabilized base/subbase materials provide more structural support and durability to both flexible and rigid pavements than conventional base/subbase materials. For the design of stabilized base/subbase layers in flexible pavements, good performance in terms of resilient modulus (Mr) under wet-dry cycle conditions is required. This study focuses on the development of a Particle Swarm Optimization-based Extreme Learning Machine (PSO-ELM) to predict the performance of stabilized aggregate bases subjected to wet-dry cycles. Furthermore, the performance of the developed PSO-ELM model was compared with the Particle Swarm Optimization-based Artificial Neural Network (PSO-ANN) and Kernel ELM (KELM). The results showed that the PSO-ELM model significantly yielded higher prediction accuracy in terms of the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), the Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and the coefficient of determination (r2) compared with the other two investigated models, PSO-ANN and KELM. The PSO-ELM was unique in that the predicted Mr values generally yielded the same distribution and trend as the observed Mr data.},

ABSTRACT = {Physiological signals contain considerable information regarding emotions. This paper investigated the ability of photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals to recognize emotion, adopting a two-dimensional emotion model based on valence and arousal to represent human feelings. The main purpose was to recognize short term emotion using a single PPG signal pulse. We used a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D CNN) to extract PPG signal features to classify the valence and arousal. We split the PPG signal into a single 1.1 s pulse and normalized it for input to the neural network based on the personal maximum and minimum values. We chose the dataset for emotion analysis using physiological (DEAP) signals for the experiment and tested the 1D CNN as a binary classification (high or low valence and arousal), achieving the short-term emotion recognition of 1.1 s with 75.3% and 76.2% valence and arousal accuracies, respectively, on the DEAP data.},

ABSTRACT = {The repair of high strength, high performance 7075 aluminum alloy is essential for a broad range of aerospace and defense applications. However, it is challenging to implement it using traditional fusion welding-based approaches, owing to hot cracking and void formation during solidification. Here, the use of an emerging solid-state additive manufacturing technology, additive friction stir deposition, is explored for the repair of volume damages such as through -holes and grooves in 7075 aluminum alloy. Three repair experiments have been conducted: double through-hole filling, single through-hole filling, and long, wide-groove filling. In all experiments, additive friction stir deposition proves to be effective at filling the entire volume. Additionally, sufficient mixing between the deposited material and the side wall of the feature is always observed in the upper portions of the repair. Poor mixing and inadequate repair quality have been observed in deeper portions of the filling in some scenarios. Based on these observations, the advantages and disadvantages of using additive friction stir deposition for repairing volume damages are discussed. High quality and highly flexible repairs are expected with systematic optimization work on process control and repair strategy development in the future.},

ABSTRACT = {Predicting the penetration rate is a complex and challenging task due to the interaction between the tunnel boring machine (TBM) and the rock mass. Many studies highlight the use of empirical and theoretical techniques in predicting TBM performance. However, reliable performance prediction of TBM is of crucial importance to mining and civil projects as it can minimize the risks associated with capital costs. This study presents new applications of supervised machine learning techniques, i.e., k-nearest neighbor (KNN), chi-squared automatic interaction detection (CHAID), support vector machine (SVM), classification and regression trees (CART) and neural network (NN) in predicting the penetration rate (PR) of a TBM. To achieve this aim, an experimental database was set up, based on field observations and laboratory tests for a tunneling project in Malaysia. In the database, uniaxial compressive strength, Brazilian tensile strength, rock quality designation, weathering zone, thrust force, and revolution per minute were utilized as inputs to predict PR of TBM. Then, KNN, CHAID, SVM, CART, and NN predictive models were developed to select the best one. A simple ranking technique, as well as some performance indices, were calculated for each developed model. According to the obtained results, KNN received the highest-ranking value among all five predictive models and was selected as the best predictive model of this study. It can be concluded that KNN is able to provide high-performance capacity in predicting TBM PR. KNN model identified uniaxial compressive strength (0.2) as the most important and revolution per minutes (0.14) as the least important factor for predicting the TBM penetration rate.},

ABSTRACT = {Target detection of electronic components on PCB (Printed circuit board) based on vision is the core technology for 3C (Computer, Communication and Consumer Electronics) manufacturing companies to achieve quality control and intelligent assembly of robots. However, the number of electronic components on PCB is large, and the shape is different. At present, the accuracy of the algorithm for detecting all electronic components is not high. This paper proposes an improved algorithm based on YOLO (you only look once) V3 (Version 3), which uses a real PCB picture and a virtual PCB picture with synthesized data as a joint training dataset, which greatly increases the recognizability of training electronic components and provides the greatest possibility for data enhancement. After analyzing the feature distribution of the five dimensionality-reduced output layers of Darknet-53 and the size distribution of the detection target, it is proposed to adjust the original three YOLO output layers to four YOLO output layers and generate 12 anchor boxes for electronic component detection. The experimental results show that the mean average precision (mAP) of the improved YOLO V3 algorithm can achieve 93.07%.},

ABSTRACT = {Use of manufactured sand to replace natural sand is increasing in the last several decades. This study is devoted to the assessment of using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) together with Teaching-Learning-Based Optimization (TLBO) for enhancing the prediction accuracy of individual Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) in predicting the compressive strength of manufactured sand concrete (MSC). The PCA technique was applied for reducing the noise in the input space, whereas, TLBO was employed to increase the prediction performance of single ANFIS model in searching the optimal weights of input parameters. A number of 289 configurations of MSC were used for the simulation, especially including the sand characteristics and the MSC long-term compressive strength. Using various validation criteria such as Correlation Coefficient (R), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE), the proposed method was validated and compared with several models, including individual ANFIS, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and existing empirical equations. The results showed that the proposed model exhibited great prediction capability compared with other models. Thus, it appeared as a robust alternative computing tool or an efficient soft computing technique for quick and accurate prediction of the MSC compressive strength.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, we propose a shape memory alloy (SMA)-based wearable robot that assists the wrist motion for patients who have difficulties in manipulating the lower arm. Since SMA shows high contraction strain when it is designed as a form of coil spring shape, the proposed muscle-like actuator was designed after optimizing the spring parameters. The fabricated actuator shows a maximum force of 10 N and a maximum contraction ratio of 40%. The SMA-based wearable robot, named soft wrist assist (SWA), assists 2 degrees of freedom (DOF) wrist motions. In addition, the robot is totally flexible and weighs 151g for the wearable parts. A maximum torque of 1.32 Nm was measured for wrist flexion, and a torque of larger than 0.5 Nm was measured for the other motions. The robot showed the average range of motion (ROM) with 33.8, 30.4, 15.4, and 21.4 degrees for flexion, extension, ulnar, and radial deviation, respectively. Thanks to the soft feature of the SWA, time cost for wearing the device is shorter than 2 min as was also the case for patients when putting it on by themselves. From the experimental results, the SWA is expected to support wrist motion for diverse activities of daily living (ADL) routinely for patients.},

ABSTRACT = {RV reducers contain multi-tooth contact characteristics, with high-impact resistance and a small backlash, and are widely used in precision transmissions, such as robot joints. The main parameters affecting the transmission performance include torsional stiffness and transmission errors (TEs). However, a cycloid tooth profile modification has a significant influence on the transmission accuracy and torsional stiffness of an RV reducer. It is important to study the multi-tooth contact characteristics caused by modifying the cycloid profile. The contact force is calculated using a single contact stiffness, inevitably affecting the accuracy of the result. Thus, a new multi-tooth contact model and a TE model of an RV reducer are proposed by dividing the contact area into several differential elements. A comparison of the contact force obtained using the finite element method and the test results of an RV reducer prototype validates the proposed models. On this basis, the influence of load on the different modification methods is studied, including a TE, the mechanical performance, and the transmission efficiency. In addition, the proposed reverse profile is particularly suitable for situations with a large clearance and torque. This study provides a reliable theoretical basis for a multi-tooth contact analysis of a cycloid profile modification.},

ABSTRACT = {Reliable prediction of remaining useful life (RUL) plays an indispensable role in prognostics and health management (PHM) by reason of the increasing safety requirements of industrial equipment. Meanwhile, data-driven methods in RUL prognostics have attracted widespread interest. Deep learning as a promising data-driven method has been developed to predict RUL due to its ability to deal with abundant complex data. In this paper, a novel scheme based on a health indicator (HI) and a hybrid deep neural network (DNN) model is proposed to predict RUL by analyzing equipment degradation. Explicitly, HI obtained by polynomial regression is combined with a convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network to extract spatial and temporal features for efficacious prognostics. More specifically, valid data selected from the raw sensor data are transformed into a one-dimensional HI at first. Next, both the preselected data and HI are sequentially fed into the CNN layer and LSTM layer in order to extract high-level spatial features and long-term temporal dependency features. Furthermore, a fully connected neural network is employed to achieve a regression model of RUL prognostics. Lastly, validated with the aid of numerical and graphic results by an equipment RUL dataset from the Commercial Modular Aero-Propulsion System Simulation(C-MAPSS), the proposed scheme turns out to be superior to four existing models regarding accuracy and effectiveness.},

ABSTRACT = {Underground spaces have become increasingly important in recent decades in metropolises. In this regard, the demand for the use of underground spaces and, consequently, the excavation of these spaces has increased significantly. Excavation of an underground space is accompanied by risks and many uncertainties. Tunnel convergence, as the tendency for reduction of the excavated area due to change in the initial stresses, is frequently observed, in order to monitor the safety of construction and to evaluate the design and performance of the tunnel. This paper presents a model/equation obtained by a gene expression programming (GEP) algorithm, aiming to predict convergence of tunnels excavated in accordance to the New Austrian Tunneling Method (NATM). To obtain this goal, a database was prepared based on experimental datasets, consisting of six input and one output parameter. Namely, tunnel depth, cohesion, frictional angle, unit weight, Poisson’s ratio, and elasticity modulus were considered as model inputs, while the cumulative convergence was utilized as the model’s output. Configurations of the GEP model were determined through the trial-error technique and finally an optimum model is developed and presented. In addition, an equation has been extracted from the proposed GEP model. The comparison of the GEP-derived results with the experimental findings, which are in very good agreement, demonstrates the ability of GEP modeling to estimate the tunnel convergence in a reliable, robust, and practical manner.},

ABSTRACT = {The International Roughness Index (IRI) is the one of the most important roughness indexes to quantify road surface roughness. In this paper, we propose a new hybrid approach between adaptive network based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and various meta-heuristic optimizations such as the genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and the firefly algorithm (FA) to develop several hybrid models namely GA based ANGIS (GANFIS), PSO based ANFIS (PSOANFIS), FA based ANFIS (FAANFIS), respectively, for the prediction of the IRI. A benchmark model named artificial neural networks (ANN) was also used to compare with those hybrid models. To do this, a total of 2811 samples in the case study of the north of Vietnam (Northwest region, Northeast region, and the Red River Delta Area) within the scope of management of the DRM-I Department were used to validate the models in terms of various criteria like coefficient of determination (R) and the root mean square error (RMSE). Experimental results affirmed the potentiality and effectiveness of the proposed prediction models whereas the PSOANFIS (RMSE = 0.145 and R = 0.888) is better than the other models named GANFIS (RMSE = 0.155 and R = 0.872), FAANFIS (RMSE = 0.170 and R = 0.849), and ANN (RMSE = 0.186 and R = 0.804). The results of this study are helpful for accurate prediction of the IRI for evaluation of quality of road surface roughness.},

ABSTRACT = {In many site investigation phases of civil and mining engineering projects, the tensile strength of the rocks is one of the most significant parameters that must be identified. This parameter can be determined directly through laboratory tests. However, conducting such laboratory tests is costly and time consuming. In this paper, a new artificial neural network (ANN)-based model is developed to predict rock tensile strength, using the invasive weed optimization (IWO) technique. Granite samples for the purpose of this research were selected from a tunnel located in Malaysia and underwent appropriate laboratory tests (i.e., Schmidt hammer, point load, dry density, as well as the Brazilian tensile strength (BTS) as system output). A simple regression analysis was carried out, and the obtained results confirmed the need for developing a model with multiple inputs, rather than one with only a single input, in order to predict BTS values. Aiming to highlight the capability of an IWO-ANN model in estimating BTS, artificial bee colony (ABC)-ANN and imperialism competitive algorithm (ICA)-ANN were also applied and developed. The parameters required for the ANN-based models were obtained using different parametric studies. According to calculated performance indices, a new hybrid IWO-ANN model can provide a higher accuracy level for the prediction of BTS compared to the ABC-ANN and ICA-ANN models. The results showed that the IWO-ANN model is a suitable alternative solution for a robust and reliable engineering design.},

ABSTRACT = {The principal purpose of this work is to develop three hybrid machine learning (ML) algorithms, namely ANFIS-RCSA, ANFIS-CA, and ANFIS-SFLA which are a combination of adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) with metaheuristic optimization techniques such as real-coded simulated annealing (RCSA), cultural algorithm (CA) and shuffled frog leaping algorithm (SFLA), respectively, to predict the critical buckling load of I-shaped cellular steel beams with circular openings. For this purpose, the existing database of buckling tests on I-shaped steel beams were extracted from the available literature and used to generate the datasets for modeling. Eight inputs, considered as independent variables, including the beam length, beam end-opening distance, opening diameter, inter-opening distance, section height, web thickness, flange width, and flange thickness, as well as one output of the critical buckling load of cellular steel beams considered as a dependent variable, were used in the datasets. Three quality assessment criteria, namely correlation coefficient (R), root mean squared error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) were employed for assessment of three developed hybrid ML models. The obtained results indicate that all three hybrid ML models have a strong ability to predict the buckling load of steel beams with circular openings, but ANFIS-SFLA (R = 0.960, RMSE = 0.040 and MAE = 0.017) exhibits the best effectiveness as compared with other hybrid models. In addition, sensitivity analysis was investigated and compared with linear statistical correlation between inputs and output to validate the importance of input variables in the models. The sensitivity results show that the most influenced variable affecting beam buckling capacity is the beam length, following by the flange width, the flange thickness, and the web thickness, respectively. This study shows that the hybrid ML techniques could help in establishing a robust numerical tool for beam buckling analysis. The proposed methodology is also promising to predict other types of failure, as well as other types of perforated beams.},

ABSTRACT = {Peak particle velocity (PPV) is a critical parameter for the evaluation of the impact of blasting operations on nearby structures and buildings. Accurate estimation of the amount of PPV resulting from a blasting operation and its comparison with the allowable ranges is an integral part of blasting design. In this study, four quarry sites in Malaysia were considered, and the PPV was simulated using gene expression programming (GEP) and Monte Carlo simulation techniques. Data from 149 blasting operations were gathered, and as a result of this study, a PPV predictive model was developed using GEP to be used in the simulation. In order to ensure that all of the combinations of input variables were considered, 10,000 iterations were performed, considering the correlations among the input variables. The simulation results demonstrate that the minimum and maximum PPV amounts were 1.13 mm/s and 34.58 mm/s, respectively. Two types of sensitivity analyses were performed to determine the sensitivity of the PPV results based on the effective variables. In addition, this study proposes a method specific to the four case studies, and presents an approach which could be readily applied to similar applications with different conditions.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, a blockchain-based data sharing and access control system is proposed, for communication between the Internet of Things (IoT) devices. The proposed system is intended to overcome the issues related to trust and authentication for access control in IoT networks. Moreover, the objectives of the system are to achieve trustfulness, authorization, and authentication for data sharing in IoT networks. Multiple smart contracts such as Access Control Contract (ACC), Register Contract (RC), and Judge Contract (JC) are used to provide efficient access control management. Where ACC manages overall access control of the system, and RC is used to authenticate users in the system, JC implements the behavior judging method for detecting misbehavior of a subject (i.e., user). After the misbehavior detection, a penalty is defined for that subject. Several permission levels are set for IoT devices’ users to share services with others. In the end, performance of the proposed system is analyzed by calculating cost consumption rate of smart contracts and their functions. A comparison is made between existing and proposed systems. Results show that the proposed system is efficient in terms of cost. The overall execution cost of the system is 6,900,000 gas units and the transaction cost is 5,200,000 gas units.},

ABSTRACT = {In mining and civil engineering applications, a reliable and proper analysis of ground vibration due to quarry blasting is an extremely important task. While advances in machine learning led to numerous powerful regression models, the usefulness of these models for modeling the peak particle velocity (PPV) remains largely unexplored. Using an extensive database comprising quarry site datasets enriched with vibration variables, this article compares the predictive performance of five selected machine learning classifiers, including classification and regression trees (CART), chi-squared automatic interaction detection (CHAID), random forest (RF), artificial neural network (ANN), and support vector machine (SVM) for PPV analysis. Before conducting these model developments, feature selection was applied in order to select the most important input parameters for PPV. The results of this study show that RF performed substantially better than any of the other investigated regression models, including the frequently used SVM and ANN models. The results and process analysis of this study can be utilized by other researchers/designers in similar fields.},

ABSTRACT = {Multidisciplinary data integration within an information system is considered a key point for rehabilitation projects. Information regarding the state of preservation and/or decision making, for sustainable restoration is prerequisite. In addition, achieving structural integrity of a historic building, especially one that has undergone many construction phases and restoration interventions, is a very elaborate task and should, therefore, involve the study of multidisciplinary information regarding historical, architectural, building material and geometric data. In this paper the elaboration of such data within 2D and 3D information systems is described. Through the process described herein, a methodology, including the acquisition, classification and management of various multisensory data, is displayed and applied within a geographic information system (GIS). Moreover, the multidisciplinary documentation process, aggregated with the surveying products, generates 3D heritage building information modeling (HBIM), including information regarding construction phases, pathology and current state of preservation of a building. The assessment of the applied methodology is performed concluding in a qualitative and a quantitative manner, in both 2D and 3D environments, providing information to facilitate the structural assessment of a historic building. Thus, in this work, the described methodology is presented, combining the multidisciplinary data with the development of GIS thematic maps and an HBIM. Representative results of the suggested methodology applied on the historic building of Villa Klonaridi, Athens, Greece are displayed.},

ABSTRACT = {Sampling-based methods are popular in the motion planning of robots, especially in high-dimensional spaces. Among the many such methods, the Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm has been widely used in multi-degree-of-freedom manipulators and has yielded good results. However, existing RRT planners have low exploration efficiency and slow convergence speed and have been unable to meet the requirements of the intelligence level in the Industry 4.0 mode. To solve these problems, a general autonomous path planning algorithm of Node Control (NC-RRT) is proposed in this paper based on the architecture of the RRT algorithm. Firstly, a method of gradually changing the sampling area is proposed to guide exploration, thereby effectively improving the search speed. In addition, the node control mechanism is introduced to constrain the extended nodes of the tree and thus reduce the extension of invalid nodes and extract boundary nodes (or near-boundary nodes). By changing the value of the node control factor, the random tree is prevented from falling into a so-called “local trap” phenomenon, and boundary nodes are selected as extended nodes. The proposed algorithm is simulated in different environments. Results reveal that the algorithm greatly reduces the invalid exploration in the configuration space and significantly improves planning efficiency. In addition, because this method can efficiently use boundary nodes, it has a stronger applicability to narrow environments compared with existing RRT algorithms and can effectively improve the success rate of exploration.},

ABSTRACT = {Most mines choose the drilling and blasting method which has the characteristics of being a cheap and efficient method to fragment rock mass, but blast-induced ground vibration damages the surrounding rock mass and structure and is a drawback. To predict, analyze and control the blast-induced ground vibration, the random forest (RF) model, Harris hawks optimization (HHO) algorithm and Monte Carlo simulation approach were utilized. A database consisting of 137 datasets was collected at different locations around the Tonglvshan open-cast mine, China. Seven variables were selected and collected as the input variables, and peak particle velocity was chosen as the output variable. At first, an RF model and a hybrid model, namely a HHO-RF model, were developed, and the prediction results checked by 3 performance indices to show that the proposed HHO-RF model can provide higher prediction performance. Then blast-induced ground vibration was simulated by using the Monte Carlo simulation approach and the developed HHO-RF model. After analyzing, the mean peak particle velocity value was 0.98 cm/s, and the peak particle velocity value did not exceed 1.95 cm/s with a probability of 90%. The research results of this study provided a simple, accurate method and basis for predicting, evaluating blast-induced ground vibration and optimizing the blast design before blast operation.},

ABSTRACT = {In the realm of the current industrial revolution, interesting innovations as well as new techniques are constantly being introduced by offering fertile ground for further investigation and improvement in the industrial engineering domain. More specifically, cutting-edge digital technologies in the field of Extended Reality (XR) have become mainstream including Augmented Reality (AR). Furthermore, Cloud Computing has enabled the provision of high-quality services, especially in the controversial field of maintenance. However, since modern machines are becoming more complex, maintenance must be carried out from experienced and well-trained personnel, while overseas support is timely and financially costly. Although AR is a back-bone technology facilitating the development of robust maintenance support tools, they are limited to the provision of predefined scenarios, covering only a limited number of scenarios. This research work aims to address this emerging challenge with the design and development of a framework, for the support of remote maintenance and repair operation based on AR, by creating suitable communication channels between the shop-floor technicians and the expert engineers who are utilizing real-time feedback from the operator’s field of view. The applicability of the developed framework is tested in vitro in a lab-based machine shop and in a real-life industrial scenario.},

ABSTRACT = {Axial bearing capacity of piles is the most important parameter in pile foundation design. In this paper, artificial neural network (ANN) and random forest (RF) algorithms were utilized to predict the ultimate axial bearing capacity of driven piles. An unprecedented database containing 2314 driven pile static load test reports were gathered, including the pile diameter, length of pile segments, natural ground elevation, pile top elevation, guide pile segment stop driving elevation, pile tip elevation, average standard penetration test (SPT) value along the embedded length of pile, and average SPT blow counts at the tip of pile as input variables, whereas the ultimate load on pile top was considered as output variable. The dataset was divided into the training (70%) and testing (30%) parts for the construction and validation phases, respectively. Various error criteria, namely mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and the coefficient of determination (R2) were used to evaluate the performance of RF and ANN algorithms. In addition, the predicted results of pile load tests were compared with five empirical equations derived from the literature and with classical multi-variable regression. The results showed that RF outperformed ANN and other methods. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to reveal that the average SPT value and pile tip elevation were the most important factors in predicting the axial bearing capacity of piles.},

ABSTRACT = {In civil engineering applications, piles (deep foundations) are pushed into the ground in order to perform as steady support of structures. As these type of foundations are able to carry a huge amount of load, they should be carefully designed in terms of their settlement. Therefore, the control and estimation of settlement is a significant issue in pilling design and construction. The objective of the present study is to introduce a modeling process of a hybrid intelligence system namely neural network optimized by particle swarm optimization (neuro-swarm) for estimation of pile settlement. To do that, properties results of several piles socketed into rock mass together with their settlements were considered as established databased to propose neuro-swarm model. Then, several sensitivity analyses were carried out to determine the most influential particle swarm optimization parameters for pile settlement prediction. Eventually, five neuro-swarm models were constructed to understand the behavior of this hybrid model on them in pile settlement prediction. As a result, according to results of five performance indices, dataset number 4 showed the highest prediction capacity among all five datasets. The coefficient of determination (R2) and system error values of (0.851 and 0.079) and (0.892 and 0.099) were obtained respectively for train and test stages of the best neuro-swarm model which reveal the capability level of this hybrid model in predicting pile settlement. The modeling process introduced in this study can be useful for the researchers who are interested to work on the same hybrid technique.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, a blockchain-based secure data sharing mechanism is proposed for Vehicular Networks (VNs). Edge service providers are introduced along with ordinary nodes to efficiently manage service provisioning. The edge service providers are placed in the neighborhood of the ordinary nodes to ensure smooth communication between them. The huge amount of data generated by smart vehicles is stored in a distributed file storage system, known as Interplanetary File System (IPFS). It is used to tackle the issues related to data storage in centralized architectures, such as data tampering, lack of privacy, vulnerability to hackers, etc. Monetary incentives are given to edge vehicle nodes to motivate them for accurate and timely service provisioning to ordinary nodes. In response, ordinary nodes give reviews to the edge nodes against the services provided by them, which are further stored in a blockchain to ensure integrity, security and transparency. Smart contracts are used to automate the system processes without the inclusion of an intermediate party and to check the reviews given to the edge nodes. To optimize gas consumption and to enhance the system performance, a Proof of Authority (PoA) consensus mechanism is used to validate the transactions. Moreover, a caching system is introduced at the edge nodes to store frequently used services. Furthermore, both security and privacy are enhanced in the proposed system by incorporating a symmetric key cryptographic mechanism. A trust management mechanism is also proposed in this work to calculate the nodes’ reputation values based upon their trust values. These values determine the authenticity of the nodes involved in the network. Eventually, it is concluded from the simulation results that the proposed system is efficient for VNs.},

ABSTRACT = {This article reports on the investigation of the effects of process parameters and their interactions on as-built part quality and resource-efficiency of the fused filament fabrication 3D printing process. In particular, the influence of five process parameters: infill percentage, layer thickness, printing speed, printing temperature, and surface inclination angle on dimensional accuracy, surface roughness of the built part, energy consumption, and productivity of the process was examined using Taguchi orthogonal array (L50) design of experiment. The experimental results were analyzed using ANOVA and statistical analysis, and the parameters for optimal responses were identified. Regression models were developed to predict different process responses in terms of the five process parameters experimentally examined in this study. It was found that dimensional accuracy is negatively influenced by high values of layer thickness and printing speed, since thick layers of printed material tend to spread out and high printing speeds hinder accurate deposition of the printed material. In addition, the printing temperature, which regulates the viscosity of the used material, plays a significant role and helps to minimize the dimensional error caused by thick layers and high printing speeds, whereas the surface roughness depends very much on surface inclination angle and layer thickness, which together determine the influence of the staircase effect. Energy consumption and productivity are primarily affected by printing speed and layer thickness, due to their high correlation with build time.},

ABSTRACT = {In this study, critical temperature and frequency characteristics of a doubly curved panel are reinforced by graphene nanoplatelets (GPLs) with the aid of a two-dimensional generalized differential quadrature method (2D-GDQM) are investigated. The size effects are included using nonlocal strain gradient theory (NSGT) that has two length scale parameters, and the panel is modeled as a panel using high order shear deformation theory (HSDT). The mechanical properties of GPLs are calculated based on the rule of mixtures and the modified Halpin–Tsai model. The novelty of the current study is in considering the effects of the thermal environment, various boundary conditions, and size effects on the frequency and critical temperature of the GPLRC panel. The validation is performed through the comparison of the numerical results for the frequency of the GPLRC panel and the literature. For more verification, a finite element model is presented using the finite element package to simulate the response of the current structure. The results created from a finite element simulation illustrate a close agreement with the numerical method results. The results demonstrate that GPLs’ weight function, the ratio of panel curvature (R1/R2), GPLs’ pattern, and size-dependent parameters have noticeable effects on the frequency and critical temperature characteristics of the GPLs-reinforced composite (GPLRC) curved panel. The favorable suggestion of this survey is that when designing the GPLRC structure, special attention should be paid to size-dependent parameters because the nonlocal and length scale parameters have an essential role in the static and dynamic behaviors of the GPLRC panel.},

ABSTRACT = {Intelligent automation, including robotics, is one of the current trends in the manufacturing industry in the context of “Industry 4.0”, where cyber-physical systems control the production at automated or semi-automated factories. Robots are perfect substitutes for a skilled workforce for some repeatable, general, and strategically-important tasks. However, this transformation is not always feasible and immediate, since certain technologies do not provide the required degree of flexibility. The introduction of collaborative robots in the industry permits the combination of the advantages of manual and automated production. In some processes, it is necessary to incorporate robots from different manufacturers, thus the design of these multi-robot systems is crucial to guarantee the maximum quality and efficiency. In this context, this paper presents a novel methodology for process automation design, enhanced implementation, and real-time monitoring in operation based on creating a digital twin of the manufacturing process with an immersive virtual reality interface to be used as a virtual testbed before the physical implementation. Moreover, it can be efficiently used for operator training, real-time monitoring, and feasibility studies of future optimizations. It has been validated in a use case which provides a solution for an assembly manufacturing process.},

ABSTRACT = {This study presents surface roughness modeling for machined parts based on cutting parameters (spindle speed, cutting depth, and feed rate) and machining vibration in the end milling process. Prediction models were developed using multiple regression analysis and an artificial neural network (ANN) modeling approach. To reduce the effect of chatter, machining tests were conducted under varying cutting parameters as defined in the stable regions of the milling tool. The surface roughness and machining vibration level are modeled with nonlinear quadratic forms based on the cutting parameters and their interactions through multiple regression analysis methods, respectively. Analysis of variance was employed to determine the significance of cutting parameters on surface roughness. The results show that the combined effects of spindle speed and cutting depth significantly influence surface roughness. The comparison between the prediction performance of the multiple regression and neural network-based models reveal that the ANN models achieve higher prediction accuracy for all training data with R = 0.96 and root mean square error (RMSE) = 3.0% compared with regression models with R = 0.82 and RMSE = 7.57%. Independent machining tests were conducted to validate the predictive models; the results conclude that the ANN model based on cutting parameters with machining vibration has a higher average prediction accuracy (93.14%) than those of models with three cutting parameters. Finally, the feasibility of the predictive model as the base to develop an online surface roughness recognition system has been successfully demonstrated based on contour surface milling test. This study reveals that the predictive models derived on the cutting conditions with consideration of machining stability can ensure the prediction accuracy for application in milling process.},

ABSTRACT = {Although manufacturing companies are currently situated at a transition point in what has been called Industry 4.0, a new revolutionary wave—Industry 5.0—is emerging as an ‘Age of Augmentation’ when the human and machine reconcile and work in perfect symbiosis with one another. Recent years have indeed assisted in drawing attention to the human-centric design of Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPS) and to the genesis of the ‘Operator 4.0’, two novel concepts that raise significant ethical questions regarding the impact of technology on workers and society at large. This paper argues that a value-oriented and ethical technology engineering in Industry 5.0 is an urgent and sensitive topic as demonstrated by a survey administered to industry leaders from different companies. The Value Sensitive Design (VSD) approach is proposed as a principled framework to illustrate how technologies enabling human–machine symbiosis in the Factory of the Future can be designed to embody elicited human values and to illustrate actionable steps that engineers and designers can take in their design projects. Use cases based on real solutions and prototypes discuss how a design-for-values approach aids in the investigation and mitigation of ethical issues emerging from the implementation of technological solutions and, hence, support the migration to a symbiotic Factory of the Future.},

ABSTRACT = {The electrical losses in power systems are divided into non-technical losses (NTLs) and technical losses (TLs). NTL is more harmful than TL because it includes electricity theft, faulty meters and billing errors. It is one of the major concerns in the power system worldwide and incurs a huge revenue loss for utility companies. Electricity theft detection (ETD) is the mechanism used by industry and academia to detect electricity theft. However, due to imbalanced data, overfitting issues and the handling of high-dimensional data, the ETD cannot be applied efficiently. Therefore, this paper proposes a solution to address the above limitations. A long short-term memory (LSTM) technique is applied to detect abnormal patterns in electricity consumption data along with the bat-based random under-sampling boosting (RUSBoost) technique for parameter optimization. Our proposed system model uses the normalization and interpolation methods to pre-process the electricity data. Afterwards, the pre-processed data are fed into the LSTM module for feature extraction. Finally, the selected features are passed to the RUSBoost module for classification. The simulation results show that the proposed solution resolves the issues of data imbalancing, overfitting and the handling of massive time series data. Additionally, the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques; i.e., support vector machine (SVM), convolutional neural network (CNN) and logistic regression (LR). Moreover, the F1-score, precision, recall and receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve metrics are used for the comparative analysis.},

ABSTRACT = {It is well known that mechanical systems require supervision and maintenance procedures. There are a lot of condition monitoring techniques that are commonly used, and in the era of IoT and predictive maintenance one may find plenty of solutions for various applications. Unfortunately in the case of belt conveyors used in underground mining a list of possible solutions shrinks quickly. The reason is that they are specific mechanical systems—the typical conveyor is located in the mining tunnel and its length may vary between 100 and 1000 m. According to mining regulations, visual inspection of the conveyor route should be done before it will start the operation. On the other hand, since environmental conditions in mining tunnels are extremely harsh and the risk of accidents is high, there is a tendency to minimize human presence in the tunnels. In this paper, we propose a prototype of an inspection robot based on a UGV platform that could support maintenance staff during the inspection. At present, the robot is controlled by an operator using radio however, we plan to make it autonomous. Moreover, its support could be significant—the robot can “see” elements of the conveyor route (RGB camera) and can identify hot spots using infrared thermography. Moreover, the detected hot spots could be localized and its position can be stored together with both types of images. In parallel, it is possible to preview images in a real-time and stored data allow analysing state of conveyor system after the inspection mission. It is also important that due to radio control systems, an operator can stay in a safe place. Such a robot can be classified as a mobile monitoring system for spatially distributed underground infrastructure.},

ABSTRACT = {Due to Industry 4.0 technologies, small- and medium-sized enterprises have a great opportunity to increase their competitiveness. However, the question remains as to whether they are truly able to implement such modern technologies faster and carry out digital transformation. The main aim of the paper is to classify small- and medium-sized enterprises into various groups, according to the level of implementation of Industry 4.0, using the Index of Industry 4.0. Based on the results of the cluster analysis, the small and medium enterprises are categorized into four different groups, according to the level of implementation of Industry 4.0. There are top Industry 4.0 technological enterprises, I4 start enterprises, noobs enterprises, and I4 advances enterprises. So far, the largest group consists of the small- and medium-sized enterprises that are just starting out with the introduction of Industry 4.0 technologies, such as IT infrastructure, digitalization (data, cloud, data analysis, and information systems), and sensors. On the other hand, the top I4 technological enterprises group is the least numerous. The analysis carried out comparing the small- and medium-sized enterprises with the large enterprises shows that the SMEs still have a lower level of Industry 4.0 implementation. This confirms the assumption that the large enterprises have greater opportunities to use new technologies and transform them into smart factories. However, this situation may change in the future if new technologies become more accessible, and SMEs are worth investing in Industry 4.0 in terms of the return on investment.},

ABSTRACT = {Additive manufacturing (AM) became widespread through several organizations due to its benefits in providing design freedom, inventory improvement, cost reduction, and supply chain design. Process planning in AM involving various AM technologies is also complicated and scarce. Thus, this study proposed a decision-support tool that integrates production and distribution planning in AM involving material extrusion (ME), stereolithography (SLA), and selective laser sintering (SLS). A multi-objective optimization approach was used to schedule component batches to a network of AM printers. Next, the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) technique was used to analyze trade-offs among conflicting criteria. The developed model was then demonstrated in a decision-support system environment to enhance practitioners’ applications. Then, the developed model was verified through a case study using automotive and healthcare parts. Finally, an experimental design was conducted to evaluate the complexity of the model and computation time by varying the number of parts, printer types, and distribution locations.},

ABSTRACT = {Due to advances in semiconductor processing technologies, each slice of a semiconductor is becoming denser and more complex, which can increase the number of surface defects. These defects should be caught early and correctly classified in order help identify the causes of these defects in the process and eventually help to improve the yield. In today’s semiconductor industry, visible surface defects are still being inspected manually, which may result in erroneous classification when the inspectors become tired or lose objectivity. This paper presents a vision-based machine-learning-based method to classify visible surface defects on semiconductor wafers. The proposed method uses deep learning convolutional neural networks to identify and classify four types of surface defects: center, local, random, and scrape. Experiments were performed to determine its accuracy. The experimental results showed that this method alone, without additional refinement, could reach a top accuracy in the range of 98% to 99%. Its performance in wafer-defect classification shows superior performance compared to other machine-learning methods investigated in the experiments.},

ABSTRACT = {Predicting bearing faults is an essential task in machine health monitoring because bearings are vital components of rotary machines, especially heavy motor machines. Moreover, indicating the degradation level of bearings will help factories plan maintenance schedules. With advancements in the extraction of useful information from vibration signals, diagnosis of motor failures by maintenance engineers can be gradually replaced by an automatic detection process. Especially, state-of-the-art methods using deep learning have contributed significantly to automatic fault diagnosis. This paper proposes a novel method for diagnosing bearing faults and their degradation level under variable shaft speed. In the proposed method, vibration signals are represented by spectrograms to apply deep learning methods through preprocessing using Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT). Then, feature extraction and health status classification are performed by a convolutional neural network (CNN), VGG16. According to our various experiments, our proposed method can achieve very high accuracy and robustness for bearing fault diagnosis even under noisy environments.},

ABSTRACT = {Robot-assisted rehabilitation therapy has been proven to effectively improve upper limb motor function and daily behavior of patients with motor dysfunction, and the demand has increased at every stage of the rehabilitation recovery. According to the motor relearning program theory, upper limb motor dysfunction can be restored by a certain amount of repetitive training. Robotics devices can be an approach to accelerate the rehabilitation process by maximizing the patients’ training intensity. This paper develops a new end-effector upper limb rehabilitation robot (EULRR) first and then presents a controller that is suitable for the assist-as-needed (AAN) training of the patients when performing the rehabilitation training. The AAN controller is a strategy that helps the patient’s arm to stay close to the given trajectory while allowing for spatial freedom. This controller enables the patient’s arm to have spatial freedom by constructing a virtual channel around the predetermined training trajectory. Patients could move their arm freely in the allowed virtual channel during rehabilitation training while the robot provides assistance when deviating from the virtual channel. The AAN controller is preliminarily tested with a healthy male subject in different conditions based on the EULRR. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed AAN controller could provide assistance when moving out of the virtual channel and provide no assistance when moving along the trajectory within the virtual channel. In the close future, the controller is planned to be used in elderly volunteers and help to increase the intensity of the rehabilitation therapy by assisting the arm movement and by provoking active participation.},

ABSTRACT = {The use of electronic loads has improved many aspects of everyday life, permitting more efficient, precise and automated process. As a drawback, the nonlinear behavior of these systems entails the injection of electrical disturbances on the power grid that can cause distortion of voltage and current. In order to adopt countermeasures, it is important to detect and classify these disturbances. To do this, several Machine Learning Algorithms are currently exploited. Among them, for the present work, the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), the Convolutional Neural Networks Long Short Term Memory (CNN-LSTM) and the CNN-LSTM with adjusted hyperparameters are compared. As a preliminary stage of the research, the voltage and current time signals are simulated using MATLAB Simulink. Thanks to the simulation results, it is possible to acquire a current and voltage dataset with which the identification algorithms are trained, validated and tested. These datasets include simulations of several disturbances such as Sag, Swell, Harmonics, Transient, Notch and Interruption. Data Augmentation techniques are used in order to increase the variability of the training and validation dataset in order to obtain a generalized result. After that, the networks are fed with an experimental dataset of voltage and current field measurements containing the disturbances mentioned above. The networks have been compared, resulting in a 79.14% correct classification rate with the LSTM network versus a 84.58% for the CNN, 84.76% for the CNN-LSTM and a 83.66% for the CNN-LSTM with adjusted hyperparameters. All of these networks are tested using real measurements.},

ABSTRACT = {Forest firefighting missions encompass multiple tasks related to prevention, surveillance, and extinguishing. This work presents a complete survey of firefighters on the current problems in their work and the potential technological solutions. Additionally, it reviews the efforts performed by the academy and industry to apply different types of robots in the context of firefighting missions. Finally, all this information is used to propose a concept of operation for the comprehensive application of drone swarms in firefighting. The proposed system is a fleet of quadcopters that individually are only able to visit waypoints and use payloads, but collectively can perform tasks of surveillance, mapping, monitoring, etc. Three operator roles are defined, each one with different access to information and functions in the mission: mission commander, team leaders, and team members. These operators take advantage of virtual and augmented reality interfaces to intuitively get the information of the scenario and, in the case of the mission commander, control the drone swarm.},

ABSTRACT = {Case-based intelligent fault diagnosis methods of rotating machinery can deal with new faults effectively by adding them into the case library. However, case-based methods scarcely refer to automatic feature extraction, and k-nearest neighbor (KNN) commonly required by case-based methods is unable to determine the nearest neighbors for different testing samples adaptively. To solve these problems, a new intelligent fault diagnosis method of rotating machinery is proposed based on enhanced KNN (EKNN), which can take advantage of both parameter-based and case-based methods. First, EKNN is embedded with a dimension-reduction stage, which extracts the discriminative features of samples via sparse filtering (SF). Second, to locate the nearest neighbors for various testing samples adaptively, a case-based reconstruction algorithm is designed to obtain the correlation vectors between training samples and testing samples. Finally, according to the optimized correlation vector of each testing sample, its nearest neighbors can be adaptively selected to obtain its corresponding health condition label. Extensive experiments on vibration signal datasets of bearings are also conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper presents the results of an environmental assessment of a Nickel-Manganese-Cobalt (NMC) Lithium-ion traction battery for Battery Electric Light-Duty Commercial Vehicles (BEV-LDCV) used for urban and regional freight haulage. A cradle-to-grave Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) of NMC111 is provided, operation and end-of-life stages are included, and insight is also given into a Life Cycle Assessment of different NMC chemistries. The environmental impacts of the manufacturing stages of the NMC111 battery are then compared with those of a Sodium-Nickel-Chloride (ZEBRA) battery. In the second part of the work, two electric-battery LDCVs (powered with NMC111 and ZEBRA batteries, respectively) and a diesel urban LDCV are analysed, considering a wide set of environmental impact categories. The results show that the NMC111 battery has the highest impacts from production in most of the impact categories. Active cathode material, Aluminium, Copper, and energy use for battery production are the main contributors to the environmental impact. However, when vehicle application is investigated, NMC111-BEV shows lower environmental impacts, in all the impact categories, than ZEBRA-BEV. This is mainly due to the greater efficiency of the NMC111 battery during vehicle operation. Finally, when comparing BEVs to a diesel LDCV, the electric powertrains show advantages over the diesel one as far as global warming, abiotic depletion potential-fossil fuels, photochemical oxidation, and ozone layer depletion are concerned. However, the diesel LDCV performs better in almost all the other investigated impact categories.},

ABSTRACT = {The converter is an important component in wind turbine power drive-train systems, and usually, it has a higher failure rate. Therefore, detecting the potential faults for prediction of its failure has become indispensable for condition-based maintenance and operation of wind turbines. This paper presents an approach to wind turbine converter fault detection using convolutional neural network models which are developed by using wind turbine Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system data. The approach starts with the selection of fault indicator variables, and then the fault indicator variables data are extracted from a wind turbine SCADA system. Using the data, radar charts are generated, and the convolutional neural network models are applied to feature extraction from the radar charts and characteristic analysis of the feature for fault detection. Based on the analysis of the Octave Convolution (OctConv) network structure, an improved AOctConv (Attention Octave Convolution) structure is proposed in this paper, and it is applied to the ResNet50 backbone network (named as AOC–ResNet50). It is found that the algorithm based on AOC–ResNet50 overcomes the issues of information asymmetry caused by the asymmetry of the sampling method and the damage to the original features in the high and low frequency domains by the OctConv structure. Finally, the AOC–ResNet50 network is employed for fault detection of the wind turbine converter using 10 min SCADA system data. It is verified that the fault detection accuracy using the AOC–ResNet50 network is up to 98.0%, which is higher than the fault detection accuracy using the ResNet50 and Oct–ResNet50 networks. Therefore, the effectiveness of the AOC–ResNet50 network model in wind turbine converter fault detection is identified. The novelty of this paper lies in a novel AOC–ResNet50 network proposed and its effectiveness in wind turbine fault detection. This was verified through a comparative study on wind turbine power converter fault detection with other competitive convolutional neural network models for deep learning.},
