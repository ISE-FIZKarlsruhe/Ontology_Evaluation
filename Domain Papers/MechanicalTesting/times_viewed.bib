ABSTRACT = {The effects of compressor aerodynamic parameters, such as pitch-chord ratio, aspect ratio, and fillet, on the cascade performance have been studied in this paper. Slot configuration at the root of the blade has been proved to be an efficient passive control method for the corner separation control in compressor cascade. The combined effects of the pitch-chord ratio, aspect ratio, and blade fillet with a slot configuration on the blade, have also been studied. Larger corner separation caused by the high pitch-chord ratio can be eliminated by the slot, which leads to fewer blades with almost the same or even better cascade performance. Various aspect ratios, together with the slot configuration, have been investigated and all of them have a positive effect on the cascade performance. For the blade with the blade fillet, the slot still has a positive effect on the control of the corner separation, while cascade performance with just a slot configuration is better than the slot configuration under the influence of the blade fillet.},

ABSTRACT = {In order to build a better understanding of the relationship between depositing mode and porosity, microstructure, and properties in wire + arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) 2319-Al components, several Al-6.3%Cu deposits were produced by WAAM technique with cold metal transfer (CMT) variants, pulsed CMT (CMT-P) and advanced CMT (CMT-ADV). Thin walls and blocks were selected as the depositing paths to make WAAM samples. Porosity, microstructure and micro hardness of these WAAM samples were investigated. Compared with CMT-P and thin wall mode, CMT-ADV and block process can effectively reduce the pores in WAAM aluminum alloy. The microstructure varied with different depositing paths and CMT variants. The micro hardness value of thin wall samples was around 75 HV from the bottom to the middle, and gradually decreased toward the top. Meanwhile, the micro hardness value ranged around 72–77 HV, and varied periodically in block samples. The variation in micro hardness is consistent with standard microstructure characteristics.},

ABSTRACT = {Modern downsized internal combustion engines benefit from high-efficiency turbocharging systems for increasing their volumetric efficiency. However, despite the efficiency increase, turbochargers often lack fast transient response due to the nature of the energy exchange with the engine, which deteriorates the vehicle’s drivability. An electrically-assisted turbocharger can be used for improving the transient response without any parasitic losses to the engine while providing energy recovery for increasing overall system efficiency. The present study provides a detailed numerical investigation on the potential of e-turbocharging to control load and if possible replace the wastegate valve. A parametric study of the optimum compressor/turbine sizing and wastegate area was performed for maximum torque, fast response time and energy regeneration across the real driving conditions speed/load area of the engine. The results showed that the implementation of a motor-generator could contribute to reducing the response time of the engine by up to 90% while improving its thermal efficiency and generating up to 6.6 kWh of energy. Suppressing the wastegate can only be achieved when a larger turbine is implemented, which as a result deteriorates the engine’s response and leads to energy provision demands at low engine speeds.},

ABSTRACT = {This study examines the implementation of a waste heat recovery system on an electric hybrid vehicle. The selected waste heat recovery method operates on organic Rankine cycle principles to target the overall fuel consumption improvement of the internal combustion engine element of a hybrid powertrain. This study examines the operational principle of hybrid electric vehicles, in which the internal combustion engines operates with an electric powertrain layout (electric motors/generators and batteries) as an integral part of the powertrain architecture. A critical evaluation of the performance of the integrated powertrain is presented in this paper whereby vehicle performance is presented through three different driving cycle tests, offering a clear assessment of how this advanced powertrain configuration would benefit under several different, but relevant, driving scenarios. The driving cycles tested highlighted areas where the driver could exploit the full potential of the hybrid powertrain operational modes in order to further reduce fuel consumption.},

ABSTRACT = {The under-actuated foot rotation that the heel of the stance leg lifts off the ground and the body rotates around the stance toe is an important feature in human walking. However, it is absent in the realized walking gait for the majority of biped robots because of the difficulty and complexity in the control it brings about. In this paper, a hybrid control approach aiming to integrate the main characteristics of human walking into a simulated seven-link biped robot is presented and then verified with simulations. The bipedal robotic gait includes a fully actuated single support phase with the stance heel supporting the body, an under-actuated single support phase, with the stance toe supporting the body, and an instantaneous double support phase when the two legs exchange their roles. The walking controller combines virtual force control and foot placement control, which are applied to the stance leg and the swing leg, respectively. The virtual force control assumes that there is a virtual force which can generate the desired torso motion on the center of mass of the torso link, and then the virtual force is applied through the real torques on each actuated joint of the stance leg to create the same effect that the virtual force would have created. The foot placement control uses a path tracking controller to follow the predefined trajectory of the swing foot when walking forward. The trajectories of the torso and the swing foot are generated based on the cart-cable model. Co-simulations in Adams and MATLAB show that the desired gait is achieved with a biped robot under the action of the proposed method.},

ABSTRACT = {Around a third of the energy input in an automotive engine is wasted through the exhaust system. Since numerous technologies to harvest energy from exhaust gases are accessible, it is of great interest to find time- and cost-efficient methods to evaluate available thermal energy under different engine conditions. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is becoming a very valuable tool for numerical predictions of exhaust flows. In this work, a methodology to build a simple three-dimensional (3D) model of the exhaust system of automotive internal combustion engines (ICE) was developed. Experimental data of exhaust gas in the most used part of the engine map in passenger diesel vehicles were employed as input for calculations. Sensitivity analyses of different numeric schemes have been conducted in order to attain accurate results. The model built allows for obtaining details on temperature and pressure fields along the exhaust system, and for complementing the experimental results for a better understanding of the flow phenomena and heat transfer through the system for further energy recovery devices.},

ABSTRACT = {The aerodynamic design of rotor blades is challenging, and is crucial for the development of helicopter technology. Previous aerodynamic optimizations that focused only on limited design points find it difficult to balance flight performance across the entire flight envelope. This study develops a global optimum envelope (GOE) method for determining blade parameters—blade twist, taper ratio, tip sweep—for optimum rotor speed helicopters (ORS-helicopters), balancing performance improvements in hover and various freestream velocities. The GOE method implements aerodynamic blade design by a bi-level optimization, composed of a global optimization step and a secondary optimization step. Power loss as a measure of rotor performance is chosen as the objective function, referred to as direct power loss (DPL) in this study. A rotorcraft comprehensive code for trim simulation with a prescribed wake method is developed. With the application of the GOE method, a DPL reduction of as high as 16.7% can be achieved in hover, and 24% at high freestream velocity.},

ABSTRACT = {Measurements of the curvatures and warpages of a printed circuit board (PCB) during a thermal solder reflow process using strain gauges are proposed in this study. In the experiments, a shadow moiré is used for measuring the out-of-plane deformations (or warpage) of a bi-material plate and a PCB with dual in-line memory module (DIMM) sockets during solder reflow heating, while the finite element method (FEM) is used to analyze the thermally-induced deformation of the PCB specimen for ensuring the validity of the measurement. Conventional strain gauges are employed to measure the strains (albeit as in-plane strain data) in both specimens during the solder reflow process. The results indicate that the strain gauge-measured strain data from the top and bottom surfaces of both specimens during the solder reflow can be converted into curvature data with specific equations, and even into global out-of-plane deformations or warpages with a proposed simple beam model. Such results are also consistent with those from the shadow moiré and FEM. Therefore, it has been proved that the strain gauge measurement associated with the simple beam model can provide a method for the real-time monitoring of PCB deformations or warpages with different temperatures during the solder reflow process.},

ABSTRACT = {This study aims to propose an analysis method for resolving the pressure response of a pneumatic brake circuit considering the effect of a transmission pipe. Pneumatic brake systems (PBS) are widely used in commercial vehicles. The pressure response characteristic of the PBS is the key factor affecting braking performance. By using the thermodynamics of a variable-quality system, the pressure response model of the brake chamber is established, which includes the dynamic model of the pipe considering the unsteady friction and heat transfer. The partial-differential control equations of pipe are solved by introducing the constrained interpolation profile (CIP) method, and a virtual chamber model is proposed to set the boundary condition so as to solve the pressure response in the brake chamber simultaneously. Thus, the regularity of the brake pressure response is obtained by considering the influence of the pipe. Lastly, the model is verified experimentally. The present study indicates that the main factors that affect the pressure response delay are the pipe length and the combination forms of the sonic conductances of the orifices inlet and outlet. Furthermore, it helps to verify that the CIP method is an effective way of solving the pressure response of a brake circuit because of its high accuracy. The present study serves as a foundation for the design and analysis of a PBS.},

ABSTRACT = {Undesirable vibrations occurring in undersea pipeline structures due to ocean currents may shorten the lifecycle of pipeline structures and even lead to their failure. Therefore, it is desirable to find a feasible and effective device to suppress the subsea vibration. Eddy current tuned mass damper (ECTMD), which employs the damping force generated by the relative movement of a non-magnetic conductive metal (such as copper or aluminum) through a magnetic field, is demonstrated to be an efficient way in structural vibration control. However, the feasibility and effectiveness of ECTMD in a seawater environment has not been reported on before. In this paper, an experiment is conducted to validate the feasibility of an eddy current damper in a seawater environment. A submerged pipeline is used as the controlled structure to experimentally study the effectiveness of ECTMD. The dynamic properties of the submerged pipeline are obtained from dynamic tests and the finite element method (FEM). The optimum design of TMD with a linear spring-damper element for a damped primary structure is carried out through numerical optimization procedures and is used to determine the optimal frequency tuning ratio and damping ratio of ECTMD. In addition, the performance of ECTMD to control the submerged pipeline model is respectively studied in free vibration case and forced vibration case. The results show that the damping provided by eddy current in a seawater environment is only slightly varied compared to that in an air environment. With the optimal ECTMD control, vibration response of the submerged pipeline is significantly decreased.},

ABSTRACT = {Weight gain and stretched abdominal muscles from an enlarged gravid uterus are remarkable features during pregnancy. These changes elicit postural instability and place strain on body segments, contributing to lower back pain. In general, the agonist and antagonist muscles act simultaneously to increase joint stabilization; however, this can cause additional muscle stress during movement. Furthermore, this activation can be observed in pregnant women because of their unstable body joints. Hence, physical modalities based on assessments of muscle activation are useful for managing low back pain during pregnancy. Musculoskeletal models are common when investigating muscle load. However, it is difficult to apply such models to pregnant women and estimate the co-contraction of muscles using musculoskeletal models. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to construct a musculoskeletal model for pregnant women that estimates the co-contraction of trunk muscles. First, motion analysis was conducted on a pregnant woman and the muscle activations of the rectus abdominis and erector spinae were measured. Then, the musculoskeletal model was specifically modified for pregnant women. Finally, the co-contraction was estimated from the results of the musculoskeletal model and electromyography data using a genetic algorithm. With the proposed methods, weakened abdominal muscle torque and the co-contraction activation of trunk muscles were estimated successfully.},

ABSTRACT = {Transonic centrifugal compressors with high performance are required in the oil and gas industries, modern gas turbine engines, and turbochargers. The sweep of the blades is one of the crucial features that have a significant influence on their performance. This paper numerically investigates mechanisms by which sweep affects the performance of a transonic impeller with twin splitters. Sweep is defined as scaling up or down the shroud chord, and the variation range of the sweep angle has been chosen from −25 to +25°. In the current case, results show that the variation of choke mass flow rate, pressure ratio, and efficiency value is around 1%. If the centrifugal compressor has a higher pressure ratio or a higher front loading, the sweep effect on compressor performance will be even stronger. The essential aerodynamic effect of sweep is the spanwise redistribution of the front loading, resulting in effects on the shock structure, the tip leakage vortex, and the flow separation. On the shroud section, forward sweep restricts the front loading, the shock strength, and the tip leakage vortex, which reduces the loss near the casing. On the hub section, aft sweep suppresses the front loading and the flow separation, which reduces the loss near the hub. It is the delicate balance between controlling the loss near the hub and the loss near the casing that determines the optimal sweep angle design.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper proposes a hybrid WAAM (wire arc additive manufacturing) and milling process (HWMP), and highlights its application in the fabrication of stiffened panels that have wide applications in aviation, aerospace, and automotive industries, etc. due to their light weight and strong load-bearing capability. In contrast to existing joining or machining methods, HWMP only deposits stiffeners layer-by-layer onto an existing thin plate, followed by minor milling of the irregular surfaces, which provides the possibility to significantly improve material utilization and efficiency without any loss of surface quality. In this paper, the key performances of HWMP in terms of surface quality, material utilization and efficiency are evaluated systematically, which are the results of the comprehensive effects of the deposition parameters (e.g., travel speed, wire-feed rate) and the milling parameters (e.g., spindle speed, tool-feed rate). In order to maximize its performances, the optimization is also performed to find the best combination of the deposition and the milling parameters. The case study shows that HWMP with the optimal process parameters improves the material utilization by 57% and the efficiency by 32% compared against the traditional machining method. Thus, HWMP is believed to be a more environmental friendly and sustainable method for the fabrication of stiffened panels or other similar structures.},

ABSTRACT = {This study proposes the design of an active stabilizing system (ASAS) for a single-track vehicle. Using the gyroscopic effects of two flywheels, this system can generate control torque to stabilize the vehicle in cases where there is centrifugal force of turning. To control the flywheel gimbals to generate stabilizing torque, a model predictive controller (MPC) is applied to control the system. For the controller design and performance evaluations, a model of a gyroscopic inverted pendulum is developed. Control strategies are proposed to stabilize the vehicle in the cases of straight running, circular motion, and path following. The results of the proposed stratgies when controlling the gyroscopic inverted pendulum showed good performance even with physical limitations of the control torques. In order to evaluate the real-time performance and the feasibility of the MPC, a real-time simulator is employed, which includes two embedded STM32F407 boards. The dynamic system and the control algorithms are respectively embedded into two STM32F407 boards for real-time simulation. Implementations of the MPC in this study demonstrate that the proposed controllers are feasible for real-time applications.},

ABSTRACT = {To find a common approach for the development of an efficient system that is able to achieve an omnidirectional jump, a jumping kinematic of a legged robot is proposed based on the behavior mechanism of a jumping spider. To satisfy the diversity of motion forms in robot jumping, a kind of 4 degrees of freedom (4DoFs) mechanical leg is designed. Taking the change of joint angle as inspiration by observing the behavior of the jumping spider during the acceleration phase, a redundant constraint to solve the kinematic is obtained. A series of experiments on three types of jumping—vertical jumping, sideways jumping and forward jumping—is carried out, while the initial attitude and path planning of the robot is studied. The proposed jumping kinematic is verified on the legged robot experimental platform, and the added redundant constraint could be verified as being reasonable. The results indicate that the jumping robot could maintain stability and complete the planned task of jumping, and the proposed spider-inspired jumping strategy could easily achieve an omnidirectional jump, thus enabling the robot to avoid obstacles.},

ABSTRACT = {Wire and arc-based additive manufacturing (WAAM) is a rapidly developing technology which employs a welding arc to melt metal wire for additive manufacturing purposes. During WAAM of thin-walled structures, as the wall height increases, the heat dissipation to the substrate is slowed down gradually and so is the solidification of the molten pool, leading to variation of the bead geometry. Though gradually reducing the heat input via adjusting the process parameters can alleviate this issue, as suggested by previous studies, it relies on experience to a large extent and inevitably sacrifices the deposition rate because the wire feed rate is directly coupled with the heat input. This study introduces for the first time an in-process active cooling system based on thermoelectric cooling technology into WAAM, which aims to eliminate the difference in heat dissipation between upper and lower layers. The case study shows that, with the aid of thermoelectric cooling, the bead width error is reduced by 56.8%, the total fabrication time is reduced by 60.9%, and the average grain size is refined by 25%. The proposed technique provides new insight into bead geometry regulation during WAAM with various benefits in terms of geometric accuracy, productivity, and microstructure.},

ABSTRACT = {In a semiconductor manufacturing process, defect cause analysis is a challenging task because the process includes consecutive fabrication phases involving numerous facilities. Recently, in accordance with the shrinking chip pitches, fabrication (FAB) processes require advanced facilities and designs for manufacturing microcircuits. However, the sizes of the particle defects remain constant, in spite of the increasing modernization of the facilities. Consequently, this increases the particle defect ratio. Therefore, this study proposes a particle defect management method for the reduction of the defect ratio. The proposed method provides a kernel-density-based particle map that can overcome the limitations of the conventional method. The method consists of two phases. The first phase is the acquisition of cumulative coordinates of the defect locations on the wafer using the FAB database. Subsequently, this cumulative data is used to generate a particle defect map based on the estimation of kernel density; this map establishes the advanced monitoring statistics. In order to validate this method, we conduct an experiment for comparison with the previous industrial method.},

ABSTRACT = {Biopotential signals are mainly characterized by low amplitude and thus often distorted by extraneous interferences, such as power line interference in the recording environment and movement artifacts during the acquisition process. With the presence of such large-amplitude interferences, subsequent processing and analysis of the acquired signals becomes quite a challenging task that has been reported by many previous studies. A number of software-based filtering techniques have been proposed, with most of them being able to minimize the interferences but at the expense of distorting the useful components of the target signal. Therefore, this study proposes a hardware-based method that utilizes a shielded drive circuit to eliminate extraneous interferences on biopotential signal recordings, while also preserving all useful components of the target signal. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated by comparing the results with conventional hardware and software filtering methods in three different biopotential signal recording experiments (electrocardiogram (ECG), electro-oculogram (EOG), and electromyography (EMG)) on an ADS1299EEG-FE platform. The results showed that the proposed method could effectively suppress power line interference as well as its harmonic components, and it could also significantly eliminate the influence of unwanted electrode lead jitter interference. Findings from this study suggest that the proposed method may provide potential insight into high quality acquisition of different biopotential signals to greatly ease subsequent processing in various biomedical applications.},

ABSTRACT = {The outside rear view mirror (OSRVM) is installed on the exterior of vehicles to secure the side and rear views of the vehicle, but its extruded design causes unwanted aerodynamic noise and vibration during driving. In this study, additional line holes (inner dents) are made on the inner and outer edges of the mirror housing without a reduction in size in order to enhance the aerodynamic flow and noise around the mirror. Based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis, this study compares the aerodynamic characteristics of the original and modified mirror models. The comparative analyses verify that the proposed OSRVM model with the inner ducts dramatically improves the velocity profiles and sound pressure levels.},

ABSTRACT = {For the past several decades, research dealing with hypersonic flight regimes has been restricted mainly to military applications. Hypersonic transportation could be a possible and affordable solution to travel in the medium term and there is renewed interest from several private organisations for commercial exploitation in this direction. Various combined cycle propulsion configurations have been proposed and the present paper deals with implications for the nozzle component of a ramjet configuration as part of one such combined cycle propulsion configuration. An investigation was undertaken for a method of turbine-based propulsion which enables the hypersonic vehicle to take off under its own power and propel the aircraft under different mission profiles into ramjet operational Mach regimes. The present study details an optimal method of ramjet exhaust expansion to produce sufficient thrust to propel the vehicle into altitudes and Mach regimes where scramjet operation can be initiated. This aspect includes a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)-based geometric study to determine the optimal configuration to provide the best thrust values. The CFD parametric analysis investigated three candidate nozzles and indicated that the dual bell nozzle design produced the highest thrust values when compared to other nozzle geometries. The altitude adaptation study also validated the effectiveness of the nozzle thrust at various altitudes without compromising its thrust-producing capabilities. Computational data were validated against published experimental data, which indicated that the computed values correlated well with the experimental data.},

ABSTRACT = {This research developed a novel proportional pressure control valve for an automobile hydraulic braking actuator. It also analyzed and simulated solenoid force of the control valves, and the pressure relief capability test of electromagnetic thrust with the proportional valve body. Considering the high controllability and ease of production, the driver of this proportional valve was designed with a small volume and powerful solenoid force to control braking pressure and flow. Since the proportional valve can have closed-loop control, the proportional valve can replace a conventional solenoid valve in current brake actuators. With the proportional valve controlling braking and pressure relief mode, it can narrow the space of hydraulic braking actuator, and precisely control braking force to achieve safety objectives. Finally, the proposed novel proportional pressure control valve of an automobile hydraulic braking actuator was implemented and verified experimentally.},

ABSTRACT = {High-speed, pressure-compensated variable displacement piston pumps are widely used in aircraft hydraulic systems for their high power density. The swash plate is controlled by the pressure-compensated valve, which uses pressure feedback so that the instantaneous output flow of the pump is exactly enough to maintain a presetting pressure. The oscillation of the swash plate is one of the major excitation sources in the high-speed piston pump, which may cause lower efficiency, shorter service life, and even serious damage. This paper presents an improved model to investigate the influence of the variable displacement mechanism on the swash plate oscillation and introduces some feasible ways to reduce oscillation of the swash plate. Most of the variable structural parameters of the variable displacement mechanism are taken into consideration, and their influences on swash plate oscillation are discussed in detail. The influence of the load pipe on the oscillation of the swash plate is considered in the improved model. A test rig is built and similarities between the experiments and simulated results prove that the simulation model can effectively predict the variable displacement mechanism state. The simulation results show that increasing the volume of the outlet chamber, the spring stiffness of the control valve, the action area of the actuator piston, and offset distance of the actuator piston can significantly reduce the oscillation amplitude of the swash plate. Furthermore, reducing the diameter of the control valve spool and the dead volume of the actuator piston chamber can also have a positive effect on oscillation amplitude reduction.},

ABSTRACT = {Compared to other engines of the same size, diesel engines are more economical in addition to their ability to generate high power. For this reason, they are widely used in many fields such as industry, agriculture, transportation, electricity generation. The increasing environmental concerns and diminishing oil resources led researchers to improve fuel consumption and emissions. In this context, the usage of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) fuel in diesel engines is one of the important research subjects that has been keeping up to date. This paper investigates the effects of LPG direct injection towards the end of air inlet period on engine emissions and performance characteristics. A four-stroke, air cooled, single cylinder diesel engine was modified to direct injection of LPG for diesel/LPG dual fuel operation. An Electronic Control Unit (ECU) was designed and used to adjust LPG injection timing and duration. LPG injection rates were selected as 30%, 50% and 70% on a mass base. The test engine was operated at 3000 rpm constant engine speed under varying load conditions. Throughout the experiments, it was observed that smoke density significantly reduced on the dual-fuel operation, compared to the pure diesel operation. Carbon Monoxide (CO) and Hydrocarbon (HC) emissions decreased by 30% and 20%, respectively. Brake Specific Fuel Consumption (BSFC) decreased by 8%. Nitrogen Oxide (NOx) emissions increased by 6% while effective efficiency increased up to 1.25%.},

ABSTRACT = {Wind turbine generators are eco-friendly generators that produce electric energy using wind energy. In this study, wind turbine generator efficiency is examined using a powertrain combination and annual power generation prediction, by employing an analysis model. Performance testing was conducted in order to analyze the efficiency of a hydraulic pump and a motor, which are key components, and so as to verify the analysis model. The annual wind speed occurrence frequency for the expected installation areas was used to predict the annual power generation of the wind turbine generators. It was found that the parallel combination of the induction motors exhibited a higher efficiency when the wind speed was low and the serial combination showed higher efficiency when wind speed was high. The results of predicting the annual power generation considering the regional characteristics showed that the power generation was the highest when the hydraulic motors were designed in parallel and the induction motors were designed in series.},

ABSTRACT = {Rail surface defects seriously affect the safety of railway systems. At present, human inspection and rail vehicle inspection are the main approaches for the detection of rail surface defects. However, there are many shortcomings to these approaches, such as low efficiency, high cost, and so on. This paper presents a novel visual inspection approach based on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images, and focuses on two key issues of UAV-based rail images: image enhancement and defects segmentation. With regards to the first aspect, a novel image enhancement algorithm named Local Weber-like Contrast (LWLC) is proposed to enhance rail images. The rail surface defects and backgrounds can be highlighted and homogenized under various sunlight intensity by LWLC, due to its illuminance independent, local nonlinear and other advantages. With regards to the second, a new threshold segmentation method named gray stretch maximum entropy (GSME) is presented in this paper. The proposed GSME method emphasizes gray stretch and de-noising on UAV-based rail images, and selects an optimal segmentation threshold for defects detection. Two visual comparison experiments were carried out to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed methods. Finally, a quantitative comparison experiment shows the LWLC-GSME model achieves a recall of 93.75% for T-I defects and of 94.26% for T-II defects. Therefore, LWLC for image enhancement, in conjunction with GSME for defects segmentation, is efficient and feasible for the detection of rail surface defects based on UAV Images.},

ABSTRACT = {In data-driven methods for prognostics, the remaining useful lifetime (RUL) is predicted based on the health indicator (HI). The HI detects the condition of equipment or components by monitoring sensor data such as vibration signals. To construct the HI, multiple features are extracted from signals using time domain, frequency domain, and time–frequency domain analyses, and which are then fused. However, the process of selecting and fusing features for the HI is very complex and labor-intensive. We propose a novel time–frequency image feature to construct HI and predict the RUL. To convert the one-dimensional vibration signals to a two-dimensional (2-D) image, the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) extracts the time–frequency image features, i.e., the wavelet power spectrum. Then, the obtained image features are fed into a 2-D convolutional neural network (CNN) to construct the HI. The estimated HI from the proposed model is used for the RUL prediction. The accuracy of the RUL prediction is improved by using the image features. The proposed method compresses the complex process including feature extraction, selection, and fusion into a single algorithm by adopting a deep learning approach. The proposed method is validated using a bearing dataset provided by PRONOSTIA. The results demonstrate that the proposed method is superior to related studies using the same dataset.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper proposes “An Integrated Self-diagnosis System (ISS) for an Autonomous Vehicle based on an Internet of Things (IoT) Gateway and Deep Learning” that collects information from the sensors of an autonomous vehicle, diagnoses itself, and the influence between its parts by using Deep Learning and informs the driver of the result. The ISS consists of three modules. The first In-Vehicle Gateway Module (In-VGM) collects the data from the in-vehicle sensors, consisting of media data like a black box, driving radar, and the control messages of the vehicle, and transfers each of the data collected through each Controller Area Network (CAN), FlexRay, and Media Oriented Systems Transport (MOST) protocols to the on-board diagnostics (OBD) or the actuators. The data collected from the in-vehicle sensors is transferred to the CAN or FlexRay protocol and the media data collected while driving is transferred to the MOST protocol. Various types of messages transferred are transformed into a destination protocol message type. The second Optimized Deep Learning Module (ODLM) creates the Training Dataset on the basis of the data collected from the in-vehicle sensors and reasons the risk of the vehicle parts and consumables and the risk of the other parts influenced by a defective part. It diagnoses the vehicle’s total condition risk. The third Data Processing Module (DPM) is based on Edge Computing and has an Edge Computing based Self-diagnosis Service (ECSS) to improve the self-diagnosis speed and reduce the system overhead, while a V2X based Accident Notification Service (VANS) informs the adjacent vehicles and infrastructures of the self-diagnosis result analyzed by the OBD. This paper improves upon the simultaneous message transmission efficiency through the In-VGM by 15.25% and diminishes the learning error rate of a Neural Network algorithm through the ODLM by about 5.5%. Therefore, in addition, by transferring the self-diagnosis information and by managing the time to replace the car parts of an autonomous driving vehicle safely, this reduces loss of life and overall cost.},

ABSTRACT = {A study was carried out with 135 surgeons to obtain a surgical laparoscopic grasper handle design that adapts to the size of each surgeon’s hand, in a functionally appropriate way, and has the sufficient ergonomics to avoid generating the problems detected nowadays. The main conclusion of the work is the practical 3D parametric design obtained for a laparoscopic surgical graspers handle that is scalable to fit each particular surgeon's hand size. In addition, it has been possible to determine that the anthropometric measure of the surgeon's hand defined as Palm Length Measured (PLM) allows the design of the 3D parametric model of the surgical handle to be conveniently scaled. The results show that both additive manufacturing and the application of ergonomics criterion provide an efficient method for the custom design and manufacture of this type of specialised tool, with potential application in other sectors.},

ABSTRACT = {This study assessed the structural performance of reinforced concrete (RC) arch bridges under strong ground motion. A detailed three-dimensional finite element model of a 400 m RC arch bridge with composite superstructure and double RC piers was developed and its behavior when subjected to strong earthquakes examined. Two sets of ground motion records were applied to simulate pulse-type near- and far-field motions. The inelastic behavior of the concrete elements was then evaluated via a seismic time history analysis. The concept of Demand to Capacity Ratios (DCR) was utilized to produce an initial estimate of the dynamic performance of the structure, emphasizing the importance of capacity distribution of force and bending moment within the RC arch and the springings and piers of the bridge. The results showed that the earthquake loads, broadly categorized as near- and far-field earthquake loads, changed a number of the bridge’s characteristics and hence its structural performance.},

ABSTRACT = {Ship-to-shore (STS) container cranes are important pieces of equipment in container terminals for container handling, so they need to be properly designed to avoid damage or collapse due to natural hazards (i.e., storms or earthquakes). However, the dynamic analyses necessary for this can be cost- and time-consuming because of the need to consider the time history of ground motions and several sources of uncertainty. Thus, sensitivity analysis on the input parameters to the responses of the structures is needed to categorize which sources of uncertainty are significant enough to be considered as random variables. In this study, an investigation is carried out into the sensitivity of some sources of uncertainty to the seismic response of a Korean container crane structure. The input random variables studied include ground motion intensity, ground motion profiles, mass, damping, and elastic modulus of steel. Nonlinear dynamic analyses are conducted using a set of 20 natural ground motions scaled to three ground motion intensity levels, in compliance with the Korean Design Standard. The method of deterministic sensitivity analysis using the so-called tornado diagram is applied for the evaluation of structural systems. For the studied type of Korean container crane, it can be stated that the intensity of ground motions (i.e., spectral acceleration) is the most significant input parameter on the response of the structure, as measured in terms of portal drift, vertical reaction of the crane’s legs, and total base shear. The next most significant influencing factors are the mass of the structure and the characteristics of every ground motion. Damping plays a relatively important role on the total base shear, while it shows almost no impact on the axial reaction of the crane’s legs. Of the three engineering design parameters (portal drift, vertical reaction, and total base shear), the elastic modulus exhibits a low effect, but it should be considered a source of uncertainty in seismic analysis.},

ABSTRACT = {The Johnson–Holmquist-II(JH-2) model is introduced as the constitutive model for rock materials in tunnel smooth blasting. However, complicated and/or high-cost experiments need to be carried out to obtain the parameters of the JH-2 constitutive model. This study chooses Barre granite as an example to propose a quick and convenient determination method for the parameters of the JH-2 model using a series of computational and extrapolated methods. The validity of the parameters is verified via comparing the results of 3D numerical simulations with laboratory blast-loading experiments. Subsequently, the verified parameter determination method, together with the JH-2 damage constitutive model, is applied in the numerical simulation of smooth blasting in Zigaojian tunnel, Hangzhou–Huangshan high-speed railway. The overbreak/underbreak induced by rock blasting and joints/discontinuities is well estimated through comparing the damage contours resulting from the numerical study with the tunnel profiles measured from the tunnel site. The peak particle velocities (PPVs) of the near field are extracted to estimate the damage scope and damage degree for the surrounding rock mass of the tunnel on the basis of PPV damage criteria. This method can be used in the excavation of rock tunnels subjected to large strains, high strain rates, and high pressures, thereby reducing safety risk and economic losses.},

ABSTRACT = {In the Korean construction industry, legal and institutional safety management improvements are continually being pursued. However, there was a 4.5% increase in the number of workers’ deaths at construction sites in 2017 compared to the previous year. Failure to wear safety helmets seems to be one of the major causes of the increase in accidents, and so it is necessary to develop technology to monitor whether or not safety helmets are being used. However, the approaches employed in existing technical studies on this issue have mainly involved the use of chinstrap sensors and have been limited to the problem of whether or not safety helmets are being worn. Meanwhile, improper wearing, such as when the chinstrap and harness fixing of the safety helmet are not properly tightened, has not been monitored. To remedy this shortcoming, a sensing safety helmet with a three-axis accelerometer sensor attached was developed in this study. Experiments were performed in which the sensing data were classified whether the safety helmet was being worn properly, not worn, or worn improperly during construction workers’ activities. The results verified that it is possible to differentiate among wearing status of the proposed safety helmet with a high accuracy of 97.0%.},

ABSTRACT = {Prognostics, such as remaining useful life (RUL) prediction, is a crucial task in condition-based maintenance. A major challenge in data-driven prognostics is the difficulty of obtaining a sufficient number of samples of failure progression. However, for traditional machine learning methods and deep neural networks, enough training data is a prerequisite to train good prediction models. In this work, we proposed a transfer learning algorithm based on Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (BLSTM) recurrent neural networks for RUL estimation, in which the models can be first trained on different but related datasets and then fine-tuned by the target dataset. Extensive experimental results show that transfer learning can in general improve the prediction models on the dataset with a small number of samples. There is one exception that when transferring from multi-type operating conditions to single operating conditions, transfer learning led to a worse result.},

ABSTRACT = {Twin-I girder bridge systems composite with precast concrete deck have advantages including construction simplification and improved concrete strength compared with traditional multi-I girder bridge systems with cast-in-place concrete deck. But the cracking is still a big issue at interior support for continuous span bridges using twin-I girders. To reduce cracks occurrence in the hogging regions subject to negative moments and to guarantee the durability of bridges, the most essential way is to reduce the tensile stress of concrete deck within the hogging regions. In this paper, the prestressed tendons are arranged to prestress the precast concrete deck before it is connected with the steel girders. In this way, the initial compressive stress induced by the prestressed tendons in the concrete deck within the hogging region is much higher than that in regular concrete deck without prestressed tendons. A finite element analysis is developed to study the long-term behaviour of prestressed concrete deck for a twin-I girder bridge. The results show that the prestressed tendons induce large compressive stresses in the concrete deck but the compressive stresses are reduced due to concrete creep. The final compressive stresses in the concrete deck are about half of the initial compressive stresses. Additionally, parametric study is conducted to find the effect to the long-term behaviour of concrete deck including girder depth, deck size, prestressing stress and additional imposed load. The results show that the prestressing compressive stress in precast concrete deck is transferred to steel girders due to concrete creep. The prestressed forces transfer between the concrete deck and steel girder cause the loss of compressive stresses in precast concrete deck. The prestressed tendons can introduce some compressive stress in the concrete deck to overcome the tensile stress induced by the live load but the force transfer due to concrete creep needs be considered. The concrete creep makes the compressive stress loss and the force redistribution in the hogging regions, which should be considered in the design the twin-I girder bridge composite with prestressed precast concrete deck.},

ABSTRACT = {In a steel-concrete composite beam (hereafter referred to as a composite beam), partial interaction between the concrete slab and the steel beam results in an appreciable increase in the beam deflections relative to full interaction behavior. Moreover, the distribution type of the shear connectors has a great impact on the degree of the composite action between the two components of the beam. To reveal the effect of shear connector layout in the performance of composite beams, on the basis of a developed one-dimensional composite beam element validated by the closed-form precision solutions and experimental results, this paper optimizes the layout of shear connectors in composite beams with partial interaction by adopting a stepwise uniform distribution of shear connectors to approximate the triangular distribution of the shear connector density without increasing the total number of shear connectors. Based on a comparison of all the different types of stepped rectangles distribution, this paper finally suggests the 3-stepped rectangles distribution of shear connectors as a reasonable and applicable optimal method.},

ABSTRACT = {As a new low volume application technology, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) application is developing quickly in China. The aim of this study was to compare the droplet deposition, control efficacy and working efficiency of a six-rotor UAV with a self-propelled boom sprayer and two conventional knapsack sprayers on the wheat crop. The total deposition of UAV and other sprayers were not statistically significant, but significantly lower for run-off. The deposition uniformity and droplets penetrability of the UAV were poor. The deposition variation coefficient of the UAV was 87.2%, which was higher than the boom sprayer of 31.2%. The deposition on the third top leaf was only 50.0% compared to the boom sprayer. The area of coverage of the UAV was 2.2% under the spray volume of 10 L/ha. The control efficacy on wheat aphids of UAV was 70.9%, which was comparable to other sprayers. The working efficiency of UAV was 4.11 ha/h, which was roughly 1.7–20.0 times higher than the three other sprayers. Comparable control efficacy results suggest that UAV application could be a viable strategy to control pests with higher efficiency. Further improvement on deposition uniformity and penetrability are needed.},

ABSTRACT = {Programming robots to perform complex tasks is a very expensive job. Traditional path planning and control are able to generate point to point collision free trajectories, but when the tasks to be performed are complex, traditional planning and control become complex tasks. This study focused on robotic operations in logistics, specifically, on picking objects in unstructured areas using a mobile manipulator configuration. The mobile manipulator has to be able to place its base in a correct place so the arm is able to plan a trajectory up to an object in a table. A deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach was selected to solve this type of complex control tasks. Using the arm planner’s feedback, a controller for the robot base is learned, which guides the platform to such a place where the arm is able to plan a trajectory up to the object. In addition the performance of two DRL algorithms ((Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)) and (Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO)) is compared within the context of a concrete robotic task.},

ABSTRACT = {A novel optical incremental and absolute encoder based on an optical application-specific integrated circuit (opto-ASIC) and an encoder disc carrying micro manufactured structures is presented. The physical basis of the encoder is the diffraction of light using a reflective phase grating. The opto-ASIC contains a ring of photodiodes that represents the encryption of the encoder. It also includes the analog signal conditioning, the signal acquisition, and the control of a light source, as well as the digital position processing. The development and fabrication of the opto-ASIC is also described in this work. A laser diode was assembled in the center on top of the opto-ASIC, together with a micro manufactured polymer lens. The latter was fabricated using ultra-precision machining. The encoder disc was fabricated using micro injection molding and contains micro structures forming a blazed grating. This way, a 10-bit optical encoder with a form factor of only 1 cm3 was realized and tested successfully.},

ABSTRACT = {Concerns have been raised recently by players’ associations regarding the risk of death among retired players. Using a retrospective cohort study, we analyzed factors associated with the mortality of National Basketball Association (NBA) players and compared their life expectancy with that of the general population. We analyzed a cohort of 3985 players who participated in the NBA from its inception in 1946 to April 2015 (481 active and 3504 former players). We used the data for the 3504 former NBA players, of whom 687 (19.1%) died before 15 April 2015, to study the elapsed time between the end of their NBA careers until death. Cox proportional hazards models were employed in the multivariate survival analysis. After adjusting for age at the end of the NBA career and calendar year, we found that mortality is associated with height and ethnicity. Taller players and African-American players had a higher instantaneous risk of death than shorter players or white players. In addition, the life expectancy of players (regardless of height and ethnicity) has increased since the inception of the NBA. This is one of the first studies using such an extensive cohort of professional basketball players and Cox proportional hazards models. Results confirmed that height is associated with mortality. In addition, ethnicity is also linked to mortality; white players and small players live longer. Our study is useful for devising strategies for health interventions and the proper allocation of resources with respect to the general population.},

ABSTRACT = {Cellular materials have been used in many applications such as insulation, packaging, and protective gear. Expanded polystyrene has been widely used as energy-absorbing liner in helmets due to its excellent cost-benefit relation. This synthetic material can absorb reasonable amounts of energy via permanent deformation. However, in real-world accidents, helmets may be subjected to multi-impact scenarios. Additionally, oil-derived plastic is presently a major source of societal concern regarding pollution and waste. As a sustainable alternative, cork is a natural cellular material with great crashworthiness properties and it has the remarkable capacity to recover after compression, due to its viscoelastic behavior, which is a desired characteristic in multi-impact applications. Therefore, the main goal is to analyze the applicability of agglomerated cork as padding material in safety helmets. First, a finite element model of a motorcycle helmet available on the market was developed to assess its safety performance and to establish a direct comparison between expanded polystyrene and cork agglomerates as liners. Secondly, a new helmet model with a generic geometry was developed to assess the applicability of agglomerated cork as liner for different types of helmets, based on the head injury risk predictions by the finite element head model, YEt Another Head Model (YEAHM), developed by the authors. Several versions of helmet liners were created by varying its thickness and removing sections of material. In other words, this generic helmet was optimized by carrying out a parametric study, and by comparing its performance under double impacts. The results from these tests indicate that agglomerated cork liners are an excellent alternative to the synthetic ones. Thus, agglomerated cork can be employed in protective gear, improving its overall performance and capacity to withstand multi-impacts.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, a single leg platform for quadruped robots is designed based on the motivation of high-speed locomotion. The leg is designed for lightweight and low inertia with a structure of three joints by imitating quadruped animals. Because high acceleration and extensive loadings will be involved on the legs during the high-speed locomotion, the trade-off between the leg mass and strength is specifically designed and evaluated with the finite element analysis. Moreover, quadruped animals usually increase stride frequency and decrease contact time as the locomotion speed increases, while maintaining the swing duration during trot gait. Inspired by this phenomenon, the foot-end trajectory for quadruped robots with a high-speed trot gait is proposed. The gait trajectory is planned for swing and stance phase; thus the robot can keep its stability with adjustable trajectories while following a specific gait pattern. Especially for the swing phase, the proposed trajectory can minimize the maximum acceleration of legs and ensure the continuity of position, speed, and acceleration. Then, based on the kinematics analysis, the proposed trajectory is compared with the trajectory of Bézier curve for the power consumption. Finally, a simulation with Webots software is carried out for verifying the motion stability with two trajectory planning schemes respectively. Moreover, a motion capture device is used for evaluating the tracking accuracy of two schemes for obtaining an optimal gait trajectory suitable for high-speed trot gait.},

ABSTRACT = {Carbon- and glass fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP and GFRP) composite materials have been used in many industries such as aerospace and automobile because of their outstanding strength-to-weight ratio and corrosion resistance. The quality of these materials is important for safe operation. Nondestructive testing (NDT) techniques are an effective way to inspect these composites. While ultrasonic NDT has previously been used for inspection of composites, conventional ultrasonic NDT, using single element transducers, has limitations such as high attenuation and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Using phased array ultrasonic testing (PAUT) techniques, signals can be generated at desired distances and angles. These capabilities provide promising results for composites where the anisotropic structure makes signal evaluation challenging. Defect detection in composites based on bulk and guided waves are studied. The capability of the PAUT and its sensitivity to flaws were evaluated by comparing the signal characteristics to the conventional method. The results show that flaw sizes as small as 0.8 mm with penetration depth up to 25 mm can be detected using PAUT, and the result signals have better characteristics than the conventional ultrasonic technique. In addition, it has been shown that guided wave generated by PAUT also has outstanding capability of flaw detection in composite materials.},

ABSTRACT = {The construction industry is infamous for a high number of fatalities around the world. The Hong Kong construction industry is also one of the most hazardous industries for worker’s safety compared to all other industries. This paper presents a current trend of occupational injuries among Hong Kong construction workers. Yearly reports of the labour department of Hong Kong were evaluated in this study. A statistical analysis of incidence rates (IRs) and mortality rates (MRs) was performed to evaluate each accident type. Moreover, analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to find out the relationship between IRs and MRs of individual accident type. From the analysis, “Slip, trip or fall on the same level” caused the higher number of occupational injuries while “fall of the person from height” caused the higher number of occupational fatalities from 2011 to 2017. Finally, the future perspectives of effective safety management system incorporated with advance technologies in the construction industry are highlighted in this study.},

ABSTRACT = {Quadcopter unmanned aerial vehicles continue to play important roles in several applications and the improvement of their control performance has been explored in a great number of studies. In this paper, we present an altitude control algorithm for quadcopters that consists of a combination of nonlinear and linear controllers. The smooth transition between the nonlinear and linear modes are guaranteed through controller gains that are obtained based on mathematical analysis. The proposed controller takes advantage and addresses some known shortcomings of the conventional proportional–integral–derivative control method. The algorithm is simple to implement, and we prove its stability through the Lyapunov theory. By prescribing certain flight conditions, we use numerical simulations to compare the control performance of our control method to that of a conventional proportional–derivative–integral approach. Furthermore, we use a DJI-F450 drone equipped with a laser ranging sensor as the experimental quadcopter platform to evaluate the performance of our new controller in real flight conditions. Numerical simulation and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

ABSTRACT = {The value of data analytics is fundamental in cyber-physical production systems for tasks like optimization and predictive maintenance. The de facto standard for conducting data analytics in industrial applications is the CRISP-DM methodology. However, CRISP-DM does not specify a data acquisition phase within production scenarios. With this chapter, we present DMME as an extension to the CRISP-DM methodology specifically tailored for engineering applications. It provides a communication and planning foundation for data analytics within the manufacturing domain, including the design and evaluation of the infrastructure for process-integrated data acquisition. In addition, the methodology includes functions of design of experiments capabilities to systematically and efficiently identify relevant interactions. The procedure of DMME methodology is presented in detail and an example project illustrates the workflow. This case study was part of a collaborative project with an industrial partner who wanted an application to detect marginal lubrication in linear guideways of a servo-driven axle based only on data from the drive controller. Decision trees detect the lubrication state, which are trained with experimental data. Several experiments, taking the lubrication state, velocity, and load on the slide into account, provide the training and test datasets.},

ABSTRACT = {The wake flow characteristics of a 1:20 scale articulated lorry model with a linear Alternate Current Dielectric Barrier Discharge (AC-DBD) plasma actuation implemented was experimentally investigated. Time-averaged velocity, turbulence, and vorticity information along the centreline of the model were constructed using a two-component particle image velocimetry technique. In addition, force balance was used to measure the time-average drag force acting on the model with and without the use of AC-DBD plasma actuation. In general, the AC-DBD plasma actuation showed negligible effect in changing the drag coefficient of the test model. Moreover, implementing the AC-DBD plasma actuation around the rear end of the trailer model could neither alter the size nor the reverse flow velocity in the wake region. In contrast, the AC-DBD plasma actuation increased the levels of fluctuation in the flow turbulence kinetic energy and vorticity but showed no observable effect to alter the frequency response of the flow in the wake region. It is deduced that the use of AC-DBD plasma actuation indeed generated no flow control effect at the rear end of an articulated lorry trailer.},

ABSTRACT = {Energy-efficiency is one of the critical issues in smart cities. It is an essential basis for optimizing smart cities planning. This study proposed four new artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for forecasting the heating load of buildings’ energy efficiency based on the potential of artificial neural network (ANN) and meta-heuristics algorithms, including artificial bee colony (ABC) optimization, particle swarm optimization (PSO), imperialist competitive algorithm (ICA), and genetic algorithm (GA). They were abbreviated as ABC-ANN, PSO-ANN, ICA-ANN, and GA-ANN models; 837 buildings were considered and analyzed based on the influential parameters, such as glazing area distribution (GLAD), glazing area (GLA), orientation (O), overall height (OH), roof area (RA), wall area (WA), surface area (SA), relative compactness (RC), for estimating heating load (HL). Three statistical criteria, such as root-mean-squared error (RMSE), coefficient determination (R2), and mean absolute error (MAE), were used to assess the potential of the aforementioned models. The results indicated that the GA-ANN model provided the highest performance in estimating the heating load of buildings’ energy efficiency, with an RMSE of 1.625, R2 of 0.980, and MAE of 0.798. The remaining models (i.e., PSO-ANN, ICA-ANN, ABC-ANN) yielded lower performance with RMSE of 1.932, 1.982, 1.878; R2 of 0.972, 0.970, 0.973; MAE of 1.027, 0.980, 0.957, respectively.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper discusses the general conditions relating to ballistic head protection, analyzing the risks that may occur on contemporary battlefields. A thorough literature review has enabled us to present development trends for helmets used in the largest armies in the world. The authors have focused on impacts to the helmet shell, overloading the entire helmet-protected head–neck system. The main objective of this study is to investigate the protective capability of a helmet shell when subjected to projectile–helmet contact, with contact curvature taken as being an indicator of the impact energy concentration. Blunt head trauma was estimated using backface deformation (BFD). The Wz.93 combat helmet was used for testing. Analytically, dependencies were derived to determine the scope of BFD. A five-parameter model of the helmet piercing process was adopted, thus obtaining the optimal BFD range. Verification of theoretical considerations was carried out on a specially developed research stand. In the ballistic tests, dynamic deflection of the helmet’s body was registered using a speed camera. On the impact testing stand, a fragment of the helmet was pierced, producing results in the low impact velocity range. Data have been presented on the appropriate graph in order to compare them with values specified in the relevant standard and existing literature. Our results correlate well with the norm and literature values.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper proposes a noble multi-robot path planning algorithm using Deep q learning combined with CNN (Convolution Neural Network) algorithm. In conventional path planning algorithms, robots need to search a comparatively wide area for navigation and move in a predesigned formation under a given environment. Each robot in the multi-robot system is inherently required to navigate independently with collaborating with other robots for efficient performance. In addition, the robot collaboration scheme is highly depends on the conditions of each robot, such as its position and velocity. However, the conventional method does not actively cope with variable situations since each robot has difficulty to recognize the moving robot around it as an obstacle or a cooperative robot. To compensate for these shortcomings, we apply Deep q learning to strengthen the learning algorithm combined with CNN algorithm, which is needed to analyze the situation efficiently. CNN analyzes the exact situation using image information on its environment and the robot navigates based on the situation analyzed through Deep q learning. The simulation results using the proposed algorithm shows the flexible and efficient movement of the robots comparing with conventional methods under various environments.},

ABSTRACT = {In the present work, the metallurgical changes in the welding of clad pipelines are studied. Clad pipes consist of a complex multi-material system, with (i) the clad being stainless steel or a nickel-based superalloy, (ii) the pipe being API X60 or X65 high-strength carbon steel, and (iii) the welding wire being a nickel-based superalloy or stainless steel in the root and hot pass, with a nickel or iron buffer layer, followed by filling with carbon steel wire. Alternatively, the corrosion resistant alloy may be used only. During production of the clad pipe, at the diffusion bonding temperature, substantial material changes may occur. These are carbon diffusion from the carbon steel to the clad, followed by the formation of hard martensite at the interface on cooling. The solidification behavior and microstructure evolution in the weld metal and in the heat-affected zone are further discussed for the different material combinations. Solidification behavior was also numerically estimated to show solidification parameters and resulting solidification modes.},

Secondly, the weld surface defects images are collected and preprocessed by image enhancement and threshold segmentation. A database of weld surface defects is established using pre-processed images. Finally, comparative experiments are performed on the weld surface defects database. The results show that the accuracy of the method combined with CNN and random forest can reach 0.9875, and it also demonstrates the method is effective and practical.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper describes an experimental test campaign while using an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and measuring the obtained UAV positions during different flight tasks and in different operative conditions. A new test procedure has been presented and tested for different devices in various weather conditions. This paper describes and analyses the measurements of the flight trajectory of the UAV that was performed with the use of a robotic total station (RTS), as compared to the design data and the data recorded in the internal memory of the UAV. Five different test tasks have been conducted. The obtained results have allowed for the assessment of the correctness of task performance as compared to the design and to determine the flying accuracy of the entire UAV set. The proposed set of tasks can be successfully utilised to control the correctness of operation of various types of UAVs and it may be implemented as a universal test to verify the algorithms optimising take-offs and landings, test flights of the objects, as well as flight planning in various terrain and weather conditions, which will increase the safety of the flights while using UAVs.},

ABSTRACT = {Target detection of electronic components on PCB (Printed circuit board) based on vision is the core technology for 3C (Computer, Communication and Consumer Electronics) manufacturing companies to achieve quality control and intelligent assembly of robots. However, the number of electronic components on PCB is large, and the shape is different. At present, the accuracy of the algorithm for detecting all electronic components is not high. This paper proposes an improved algorithm based on YOLO (you only look once) V3 (Version 3), which uses a real PCB picture and a virtual PCB picture with synthesized data as a joint training dataset, which greatly increases the recognizability of training electronic components and provides the greatest possibility for data enhancement. After analyzing the feature distribution of the five dimensionality-reduced output layers of Darknet-53 and the size distribution of the detection target, it is proposed to adjust the original three YOLO output layers to four YOLO output layers and generate 12 anchor boxes for electronic component detection. The experimental results show that the mean average precision (mAP) of the improved YOLO V3 algorithm can achieve 93.07%.},

ABSTRACT = {Vibrations on timber floors are among the most common serviceability problems in social housing projects. The presence of low damping levels on these floors could cause excessive vibrations in a range of frequency and amplitude that generate discomfort in users. This study focuses on the influence of the damping ratio in the dynamic serviceability of social housing timber floors due to walking excitations. More than 60 human-walking vibration tests were conducted on both laboratory and in-situ timber floors. The floors were instrumented with accelerometers, and fundamental modal damping ratios were estimated by applying Enhanced Frequency Decomposition Domain (EFDD) and Subspace Stochastic Identification (SSI) methods. The vibration dose value (VDV) was used to estimate the dynamic serviceability of floors. The results indicated that timber floors had an impulsive-type vibration response, with fundamental damping ratios between 1.9% and 14.8%, depending on their constructive characteristics. The in-situ floors had damping ratios between two to three times greater than the laboratory floors due to the presence of non-structural elements. Finally, it was possible to demonstrate that the floors with the highest damping ratios reached lower vibration dose values and, therefore, a better dynamic serviceability performance.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, we propose a shape memory alloy (SMA)-based wearable robot that assists the wrist motion for patients who have difficulties in manipulating the lower arm. Since SMA shows high contraction strain when it is designed as a form of coil spring shape, the proposed muscle-like actuator was designed after optimizing the spring parameters. The fabricated actuator shows a maximum force of 10 N and a maximum contraction ratio of 40%. The SMA-based wearable robot, named soft wrist assist (SWA), assists 2 degrees of freedom (DOF) wrist motions. In addition, the robot is totally flexible and weighs 151g for the wearable parts. A maximum torque of 1.32 Nm was measured for wrist flexion, and a torque of larger than 0.5 Nm was measured for the other motions. The robot showed the average range of motion (ROM) with 33.8, 30.4, 15.4, and 21.4 degrees for flexion, extension, ulnar, and radial deviation, respectively. Thanks to the soft feature of the SWA, time cost for wearing the device is shorter than 2 min as was also the case for patients when putting it on by themselves. From the experimental results, the SWA is expected to support wrist motion for diverse activities of daily living (ADL) routinely for patients.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, the effects of different tempering temperatures on a recently developed ultrahigh-strength steel with 0.4 wt.% carbon content were studied. The steel is designed to be used in press-hardening for different wear applications, which require high surface hardness (650 HV/58 HRC). Hot-rolled steel sheet from a hot strip mill was austenitized, water quenched and subjected to 2-h tempering at different temperatures ranging from 150 °C to 400 °C. Mechanical properties, microstructure, dislocation densities, and fracture surfaces of the steels were characterized. Tensile strength greater than 2200 MPa and hardness above 650 HV/58 HRC were measured for the as-quenched variant. Tempering decreased the tensile strength and hardness, but yield strength increased with low-temperature tempering (150 °C and 200 °C). Charpy-V impact toughness improved with low-temperature tempering, but tempered martensite embrittlement at 300 °C and 400 °C decreased the impact toughness at −40 °C. Dislocation densities as estimated using X-ray diffraction showed a linear decrease with increasing tempering temperature. Retained austenite was present in the water quenched and low-temperature tempered samples, but no retained austenite was found in samples subjected to tempering at 300 °C or higher. The substantial changes in the microstructure of the steels caused by the tempering are discussed.},

ABSTRACT = {The development of a reliable pick-and-place system for industrial robotics is facing an urgent demand because many manual-labor works, such as piece-picking in warehouses and fulfillment centers tend toward automation. This paper presents an integrated gripper that combines a linkage-driven underactuated gripper with a suction gripping system for picking up a variety of objects in different working environments. The underactuated gripper consists of two fingers, and each finger has three degrees of freedom that are obtained by stacking one five-bar mechanism over one double parallelogram. Furthermore, each finger is actuated by two motors, both of which can be installed at the base owing to the special architecture of the proposed robotic finger. A suction cup is used to grasp objects in narrow spaces and cluttered environments. The combination of the suction and traditional linkage-driven grippers allows stable and reliable grasping under different working environments. Finally, practical experiments using a wide range of objects and under different grasping scenarios are performed to demonstrate the grasping capability of the integrated gripper.},

ABSTRACT = {To design and analyze a hook lock mechanism for a certain type of aircraft landing gear, numerical continuation and bifurcation theory are employed to study the performance of the lock mechanism in this paper. First, dynamic and static models of the hook lock mechanism are created separately, and by analyzing the locking and unlocking processes of the lock mechanism, the dynamic results are compared with the static numerical continuation results. According to the results, the static numerical continuation results agree excellently with the dynamic model results at the position of the stable equilibrium solution. Although the dynamic results can hardly explain the jump phenomenon of the lock mechanism at the moment of locking or unlocking, the bifurcation point of the static results suggests the occurrence of a stability change in the lock mechanism at the moment of jumping, thereby explaining the jumping mechanism of the lock mechanism. Therefore, the influences of the landing gear overload, lock spring parameters and attachment position on the performance of the lock mechanism are investigated. Furthermore, the critical installation position of the limit stop is defined, and the critical unlocking force of the lock mechanism is designed optimally based on the multi-island genetic algorithm.},

ABSTRACT = {Formula Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) (FSAE) is a student design competition organized by SAE International (previously known as the Society of Automotive Engineers, SAE). Commonly, the student team performs a lap simulation as a point mass, bicycle or planar model of vehicle dynamics allow for the design of a top-level concept of the FSAE vehicle. However, to design different FSAE components, a full vehicle simulation is required including a comprehensive tire model. In the proposed study, the different tires of a FSAE vehicle were tested at a track to parametrize the tire based on the empirical approach commonly known as the magic formula. A thermal tire model was proposed to describe the tread, carcass, and inflation gas temperatures. The magic formula was modified to incorporate the temperature effect on the force capability of a FSAE tire to achieve higher accuracy in the simulation environment. Considering the model validation, the several maneuvers, typical for FSAE competitions, were performed. A skidpad and full lap maneuvers were chosen to simulate steady-state and transient behavior of the FSAE vehicle. The full vehicle simulation results demonstrated a high correlation to the measurement data for steady-state maneuvers and limited accuracy in highly dynamic driving. In addition, the results show that neglecting temperature in the tire model results in higher root mean square error (RMSE) of lateral acceleration and yaw rate.},

ABSTRACT = {A full-vehicle analysis model was constructed incorporating a SLA (Short Long Arm) strut front suspension system and a multi-link rear suspension system. CAE (Computer Aided Engineering) simulations were then performed to investigate the lateral acceleration, yaw rate, roll rate, and steering wheel angle of the vehicle during constant radius cornering tests. The validity of the simulation results was confirmed by comparing the computed value of the understeer coefficient (Kus) with the experimental value. The validated model was then used to investigate the steady-state cornering performance of the vehicle (i.e., the roll gradient and yaw rate gain) at various speeds. The transient response of the vehicle was then examined by means of simulated impulse steering tests. The simulation results were confirmed by comparing the calculated values of the phase lag, natural frequency, yaw rate gain rate, and damping ratio at various speeds with the experimental results. A final series of experiments was then performed to evaluate the relative effects of the cornering stiffness, initial toe-in angle, and initial camber angle on the steady-state and transient-state full-vehicle cornering handling performance. The results show that the handling performance can be improved by increasing the cornering stiffness and initial toe-in angle or reducing the initial camber angle.},

ABSTRACT = {Conventional navigation systems used in transsphenoidal pituitary surgery have limitations that may lead to organ damage, including long image registration time, absence of alarms when approaching vital organs and lack of 3-D model information. To resolve the problems of conventional navigation systems, this study proposes a U-Net-based, automatic segmentation algorithm for optical nerves and internal carotid arteries, by training patient computed tomography angiography images. The authors have also developed a bendable endoscope and surgical tool to eliminate blind regions that occur when using straight, rigid, conventional endoscopes and surgical tools during transsphenoidal pituitary surgery. In this study, the effectiveness of a U-Net-based navigation system integrated with bendable surgical tools and a bendable endoscope has been demonstrated through phantom-based experiments. In order to measure the U-net performance, the Jaccard similarity, recall and precision were calculated. In addition, the fiducial and target registration errors of the navigation system and the accuracy of the alarm warning functions were measured in the phantom-based environment.},

ABSTRACT = {(1) Objective: External fixation systems are commonly used by surgeons to ensure stabilization and consolidation of bone fractures, especially in patients who are at high risk for systematic complications. Both rigid and elastic external fixations are important in the fracture healing process. This study aims to evaluate the behavior of the Orthofix Limb Reconstruction System (LRS)® in the dynamic compression mode. (2) Methods: Experimental and numerical setups were developed using a simplified model of a human tibia which consisted of a nylon bar with a diameter of 30 mm. The bone callus was included in both setups by means of a load cell-based system, which consisted of two carbon epoxy laminated composite plates with a final stiffness of 220 N/mm. The system was evaluated experimentally and numerically, considering different numbers of pins and comparing distances between the external fixator frame and the bone, achieving a good correlation between experimental and numerical results. (3) Results: The results identified and quantified the percental load transferred to the fracture and its sensibility to the distance between the external fixator and bone. Additionally, LRS locking stiffness was evaluated which resulted from the clamp-rail clearances. The results show that the blocking effects of the free clamp movement are directly related to the fixator configuration and are responsible for changes in the amount of load that crosses the bone callus. (4) Conclusions: From the biomechanical point of view, the results suggest that the average bending span of Schanz pins and the weights of the patients should be included into clinical studies of external fixators comparisons purpose.},

In this study, three different types of dies, including traditional flat die, pocket die and spread die were designed to extrude complex and large-scale solid profiles. The design parameters for these dies were used from actual extrusion experience. The results obtained from steady-state simulation such as velocity, temperature, extrusion force, and die deformation were used to assess the advantages and disadvantages of the dies. Transient simulations were performed to analyze the evolution of transverse weld in the pocket and spread dies. The effects of ram speeds on the related extrusion parameters were also investigated. The research results provide useful guides for designers and engineers in selecting these types of extrusion dies.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, a blockchain-based data sharing and access control system is proposed, for communication between the Internet of Things (IoT) devices. The proposed system is intended to overcome the issues related to trust and authentication for access control in IoT networks. Moreover, the objectives of the system are to achieve trustfulness, authorization, and authentication for data sharing in IoT networks. Multiple smart contracts such as Access Control Contract (ACC), Register Contract (RC), and Judge Contract (JC) are used to provide efficient access control management. Where ACC manages overall access control of the system, and RC is used to authenticate users in the system, JC implements the behavior judging method for detecting misbehavior of a subject (i.e., user). After the misbehavior detection, a penalty is defined for that subject. Several permission levels are set for IoT devices’ users to share services with others. In the end, performance of the proposed system is analyzed by calculating cost consumption rate of smart contracts and their functions. A comparison is made between existing and proposed systems. Results show that the proposed system is efficient in terms of cost. The overall execution cost of the system is 6,900,000 gas units and the transaction cost is 5,200,000 gas units.},

ABSTRACT = {A titanium alloy implant of appropriate pore size can potentially enhance osseointegration and soft tissue integration. However, the human clinical application of such implants has not been reported. Here, we present a case of limb salvage surgery for a bone tumor using customized three-dimensional (3D)-printed Ti6Al4V radius and ulna implants. The patient presented with local recurrence at the proximal junction of the ulna and underwent a re-wide excision. Single forearm bone surgery was performed using another 3D-printed implant after resection of the recurrent tumor with an ulnar implant. Host osseointegration and soft tissue integration of the retrieved implant were quantified through histological evaluation. The total tissue integration rates of the implant at the proximal and distal bone junctions were 45.96% and 15.03%, respectively. The mesh structure enhanced bone integration by up to 10.81% in the proximal and by up to 8.91% in the distal bone junction. Furthermore, the soft tissue adhesion rates of the implant shaft were 59.50% and 50.26% in the axial and longitudinal cuts, respectively. No area was left unoccupied throughout the shaft of the implant. Overall, these results indicate that the 3D-printed Ti6Al4V titanium alloy implant with a rough surface has considerable tissue integration ability.},

ABSTRACT = {Most sports like surfing are highly developed. It is necessary to tease the last percentages out of the competitors and equipment—in the case of surfing the surfboard-fin-system—to win competitions or championships. In this computational investigation, a parameter study of the positioning of the two rear fins within a 4-fin configuration with fixed front fins on a surfboard is executed to find appropriate fin positions for specific surf situations. Four different inflow velocities are investigated. The RANS and URANS models combined with the SST k − ω turbulence model, which is available within the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) package STAR-CCM+, are used to simulate the flow field around the fins for angles of attack (AoA) between 0° and 45°. The simulation results show that shifting the rear fins toward the longitudinal axis of the surfboard lowers the maximum lift. Surfboards with 4-fin configurations are slower in nearly the whole range of AoA due to a higher drag force but produce a higher lift force compared to the 3-fin configuration. The lift and drag forces increase significantly with increasing inflow velocity. This study shows a significant influence of the rear fin positioning and the inflow velocity on lift and drag performance characteristics.},

ABSTRACT = {In the triangular meshes obtained in additive repair, it is a challenge to find one single hole-filling method to close all holes and make the filling patches assort with surrounding meshes well with low time complexity, which is mainly caused by the shape complexity and size difference of the various holes, especially in the fields of intelligent manufacturing, 3D measurement, and reverse engineering. Therefore, it is reasonable to adopt different algorithms to fill different types of holes. In this research, a fast hole-filling method for triangular mesh is proposed based on the hole size. First, a group of basic concepts is defined to make them uniform throughout the whole text, followed by the descriptions of hole detection and boundary cleaning. Second, three different algorithms are developed to fill the small-sized, middle-sized, and large-sized holes classified by hole size respectively, which can fill all the detected holes in a fast and proper manner. Finally, two experiments are carried out to verify the efficiency, robustness, and ability to recover the shape of our method. Compared to two state-of-the-art hole-filling methods in the first experiment, the quantitative evaluation results demonstrate that our proposed method is much faster than them with the ability to guarantee the regularity of most filling triangles. The second experiment proves that our method can produce satisfactory filling results by making the filling patches be compatible with surrounding meshes well.},

ABSTRACT = {Diesel engines, as power equipment, are widely used in the fields of the automobile industry, ship industry, and power equipment. Due to wear or faulty adjustment, the valve train clearance abnormal fault is a typical failure of diesel engines, which may result in the performance degradation, even valve fracture and cylinder hit fault. However, the failure mechanism features mainly in the time domain and angular domain, on which the current diagnosis methods are based, are easily affected by working conditions or are hard to extract accurate enough from, as the diesel engine keeps running in transient and non-stationary processes. This work aimed at diagnosing this fault mainly based on frequency band features, which would change when the valve clearance fault occurs. For the purpose of extracting a series of frequency band features adaptively, a decomposition technique based on improved variational mode decomposition was investigated in this work. As the connection between the features and the fault was fuzzy, the random forest algorithm was used to analyze the correspondence between features and faults. In addition, the feature dimension was reduced to improve the operation efficiency according to importance score. The experimental results under variable speed condition showed that the method based on variational mode decomposition and random forest was capable to detect the valve clearance fault effectively.},

ABSTRACT = {In the realm of the current industrial revolution, interesting innovations as well as new techniques are constantly being introduced by offering fertile ground for further investigation and improvement in the industrial engineering domain. More specifically, cutting-edge digital technologies in the field of Extended Reality (XR) have become mainstream including Augmented Reality (AR). Furthermore, Cloud Computing has enabled the provision of high-quality services, especially in the controversial field of maintenance. However, since modern machines are becoming more complex, maintenance must be carried out from experienced and well-trained personnel, while overseas support is timely and financially costly. Although AR is a back-bone technology facilitating the development of robust maintenance support tools, they are limited to the provision of predefined scenarios, covering only a limited number of scenarios. This research work aims to address this emerging challenge with the design and development of a framework, for the support of remote maintenance and repair operation based on AR, by creating suitable communication channels between the shop-floor technicians and the expert engineers who are utilizing real-time feedback from the operator’s field of view. The applicability of the developed framework is tested in vitro in a lab-based machine shop and in a real-life industrial scenario.},

ABSTRACT = {In the design optimization of robot arms, the use of simulation technologies for modeling and optimizing the objective functions is still challenging. The difficulty is not only associated with the large computational cost of high-fidelity structural simulations but also linked to the reasonable compromise between the multiple conflicting objectives of robot arms. In this paper we propose a surrogate-based evolutionary optimization (SBEO) method via a global optimization approach, which incorporates the response surface method (RSM) and multi-objective evolutionary algorithm by decomposition (the differential evolution (DE ) variant) (MOEA/D-DE) to tackle the shape design optimization problem of robot arms for achieving high speed performance. The computer-aided engineering (CAE) tools such as CAE solvers, computer-aided design (CAD) Inventor, and finite element method (FEM) ANSYS are first used to produce the design and assess the performance of the robot arm. The surrogate model constructed on the basis of Box–Behnken design is then used in the MOEA/D-DE, which includes the process of selection, recombination, and mutation, to optimize the robot arm. The performance of the optimized robot arm is compared with the baseline one to validate the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed method. The results obtained for the adopted example show that the proposed method can not only significantly improve the robot arm performance and save computational cost but may also be deployed to solve other complex design optimization problems.},

ABSTRACT = {The problem of production flow and evaluation of productivity in the manufacturing line is analysed. Machines can be operated by humans or by robots. Since breakdowns and human factors affect the destabilization of the production processes, robots are preferred. The main problem is a proper methodology—how can we determine the real difference in work efficiency between human and robot at the design stage? Therefore, an analysis of the productivity and reliability of the machining line operated by human operators or industrial robots is presented. Some design variants and simulation models in FlexSim have been developed, taking into consideration the availability and reliability of the machines, operators and robots. Traditional productivity metrics, such as the throughput and utilization rate, are not very helpful for identifying the underlying problems and opportunities for productivity improvement in a manufacturing system, therefore we apply the OEE (overall equipment effectiveness) metric to present how the availability and reliability parameters influence the performance of the workstation, in the short and long terms. The implementation results of a real robotic line from industry are presented with the use of the overall factory efficiency (OFE) metric. The analysis may help factories achieve the level of world class manufacturing.},

ABSTRACT = {Assisting in the starting procedure of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is one of many very important areas of modern aviation research. Supported start-up saves fuel or electrical energy, increases operator safety and level of autonomy, extends the application area, and, in some applications, even enables the operator to shape the motion characteristics of the initial phase of a UAV’s flight. Currently used solutions, depending on an aircraft’s class, are based on the utilization of rubber, pneumatic or electromagnetic launchers. All of these launchers are used for the medium class of UAVs and all of them use the potential energy previously stored in stretched rubber, compressed air or electrical voltage. In this paper, authors propose the novel concept of a launcher powered through kinetic energy stored in a rotary wheel driven by an electric motor. Using the transmission systems of the drive and the controlled clutch and an electromagnetic brake, it is possible to precisely control the speed and acceleration of the launched object. Within the paper, the authors present and discuss the applied equations of dynamics, the results of a simulation that was carried out using the MATLAB/Simulink software and a conceptual CAD model of preliminary engineering solutions for the kinetic UAV launcher. The work is summarized in the conclusions section, which details the practical implementation of the device.},

ABSTRACT = {Intelligent automation, including robotics, is one of the current trends in the manufacturing industry in the context of “Industry 4.0”, where cyber-physical systems control the production at automated or semi-automated factories. Robots are perfect substitutes for a skilled workforce for some repeatable, general, and strategically-important tasks. However, this transformation is not always feasible and immediate, since certain technologies do not provide the required degree of flexibility. The introduction of collaborative robots in the industry permits the combination of the advantages of manual and automated production. In some processes, it is necessary to incorporate robots from different manufacturers, thus the design of these multi-robot systems is crucial to guarantee the maximum quality and efficiency. In this context, this paper presents a novel methodology for process automation design, enhanced implementation, and real-time monitoring in operation based on creating a digital twin of the manufacturing process with an immersive virtual reality interface to be used as a virtual testbed before the physical implementation. Moreover, it can be efficiently used for operator training, real-time monitoring, and feasibility studies of future optimizations. It has been validated in a use case which provides a solution for an assembly manufacturing process.},

ABSTRACT = {Although manufacturing companies are currently situated at a transition point in what has been called Industry 4.0, a new revolutionary wave—Industry 5.0—is emerging as an ‘Age of Augmentation’ when the human and machine reconcile and work in perfect symbiosis with one another. Recent years have indeed assisted in drawing attention to the human-centric design of Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPS) and to the genesis of the ‘Operator 4.0’, two novel concepts that raise significant ethical questions regarding the impact of technology on workers and society at large. This paper argues that a value-oriented and ethical technology engineering in Industry 5.0 is an urgent and sensitive topic as demonstrated by a survey administered to industry leaders from different companies. The Value Sensitive Design (VSD) approach is proposed as a principled framework to illustrate how technologies enabling human–machine symbiosis in the Factory of the Future can be designed to embody elicited human values and to illustrate actionable steps that engineers and designers can take in their design projects. Use cases based on real solutions and prototypes discuss how a design-for-values approach aids in the investigation and mitigation of ethical issues emerging from the implementation of technological solutions and, hence, support the migration to a symbiotic Factory of the Future.},

ABSTRACT = {In general, the demand for delivery cannot be fulfilled efficiently due to the excessive traffic in dense urban areas. Therefore, many innovative concepts for intelligent transportation of freight have recently been developed. One of these concepts relies on drone-based parcel delivery using rooftops of city buildings. To apply drone logistics system in cities, the operation design should be adequately prepared. In this regard, a mixed integer programming model for drone operation planning and a heuristic based on block stacking are newly proposed to provide solutions. Additionally, numerical experiments with three different problem sizes are conducted to check the feasibility of the proposed model and to assess the performance of the proposed heuristic. The experimental results show that the proposed model seems to be viable and that the developed heuristic provides very good operation plans in terms of the optimality gap and the computation time.},

ABSTRACT = {Due to advances in semiconductor processing technologies, each slice of a semiconductor is becoming denser and more complex, which can increase the number of surface defects. These defects should be caught early and correctly classified in order help identify the causes of these defects in the process and eventually help to improve the yield. In today’s semiconductor industry, visible surface defects are still being inspected manually, which may result in erroneous classification when the inspectors become tired or lose objectivity. This paper presents a vision-based machine-learning-based method to classify visible surface defects on semiconductor wafers. The proposed method uses deep learning convolutional neural networks to identify and classify four types of surface defects: center, local, random, and scrape. Experiments were performed to determine its accuracy. The experimental results showed that this method alone, without additional refinement, could reach a top accuracy in the range of 98% to 99%. Its performance in wafer-defect classification shows superior performance compared to other machine-learning methods investigated in the experiments.},

ABSTRACT = {This study focuses on the structural analysis of the front single-sided swingarm of a new three-wheel electric motorcycle, recently designed to meet the challenges of the vehicle electrification era. The primary target is to develop a swingarm capable of withstanding the forces applied during motorcycle’s operation and, at the same time, to be as lightweight as possible. Different scenarios of force loadings are considered and emphasis is given to braking forces in emergency braking conditions where higher loads are applied to the front wheels of the vehicle. A dedicated Computer Aided Engineering (CAE) software is used for the structural evaluation of different swingarm designs, through a series of finite element analysis simulations. A topology optimization procedure is also implemented to assist the redesign effort and reduce the weight of the final design. Simulation results in the worst-case loading conditions, indicate strongly that the proposed structure is effective and promising for actual prototyping. A direct comparison of results for the initial and final swingarm design revealed that a 23.2% weight reduction was achieved.},

ABSTRACT = {The variable guide vanes (VGV) of gas turbine engines are commonly utilized to expand operating range and to improve efficiency of the compressor. Guiding air flow using the VGVs in the compressor prevents aerodynamic instability by making proper incidence angle to the blades. In this study, we dealt with rig-type three-stages VGVs for developed engine tests. The three link mechanism of VGVs are linked to each other with two hydraulic actuators, and inevitably, induced hysteresis exists between vane rotations and actuators strokes, due to links with non-fully constrained degree of freedoms for easy installation and instrumentation, as well. Therefore, the adjustment of each VGVs link mechanism is required to satisfy vane angle demands. To adjust coupled three-stages VGVs link mechanism, an analytical VGV-link kinematic model was derived, and effects of two adjusting parameters (lengths of bell cranks and vertical links) were discovered. Lastly, we obtained two vane angle schedule curves from the experiments according to link moving directions, and applied them to the engine controller to minimize hysteresis of the variable inlet guide vane (VIGV). The proposed VGV adjusting and controlling method can be simply applied to the pre-designed or pre-manufactured VGVs system without mechanical compensation or additional cost.},

While there have been so many new developments in this field, no studies have addressed the tutorial aspects in this field to help the engineers learn the concept and implement by their own effort. The three most common techniques—the autoregressive model, spectral kurtosis, and envelope analysis—are selected to demonstrate the bearing diagnosis process. Simulation signal is introduced to help understand the characteristics of fault signal and carry out the process toward the fault identification. The techniques are then applied to the two real datasets to demonstrate the practical applications, one made by the authors and the other by the Case Western Reserve University, which is known as a standard reference in testing the diagnostic algorithms.},

ABSTRACT = {In the present study, a novel approach to estimating the efficiency of roller chain power transmission systems is proposed based on sliding friction losses and damping force. The dynamics model is taken into account between chain links with lateral offset owing to the derailleur system. Frictional losses were calculated according to Coulomb’s law of friction, and the damping force was dependent on the damping coefficient. The effects of rotational speed, load, derailleur system, and damping coefficient on transmission efficiency were analyzed. The test stand of the roller chain power transmission system was set up to verify the estimated efficiency, and the results showed a good correlation, demonstrating the validity of the chain power transmission efficiency estimation.},

ABSTRACT = {The field of Flexible Manufacturing Systems (FMS) has seen in recent years a dynamic development trend and can now be considered an integral part of intelligent manufacturing systems and a basis for digital manufacturing. Developing the factory of the future in an increasingly competitive industrial environment involves the study and analysis of some FMS key elements and managerial, technical, and innovative efforts. Using a new approach, thus paper presents a material flow design methodology for flexible manufacturing systems in order to establish the optimal architecture of the analyzed system. The research offers a solution for modeling and optimizing material flows in advanced manufacturing systems. By using a dedicated analysis and simulation software, the structure of the system can be established and specific technical and economic parameters can be determined for each processing and transport capacity. Different processing scenarios will be evaluated through virtual modeling and simulations in order to increase the performance and efficiency of the system. Thus, an interactive tool useful in the design and management of flexible manufacturing lines will be developed for companies operating in the industrial sector. The application of this paper is mainly in the field of development of intelligent manufacturing systems, where the control system will make and use simulations in order to analyze current parameters and to predict the future.},

This work presents a complete survey of firefighters on the current problems in their work and the potential technological solutions. Additionally, it reviews the efforts performed by the academy and industry to apply different types of robots in the context of firefighting missions. Finally, all this information is used to propose a concept of operation for the comprehensive application of drone swarms in firefighting. The proposed system is a fleet of quadcopters that individually are only able to visit waypoints and use payloads, but collectively can perform tasks of surveillance, mapping, monitoring, etc. Three operator roles are defined, each one with different access to information and functions in the mission: mission commander, team leaders, and team members. These operators take advantage of virtual and augmented reality interfaces to intuitively get the information of the scenario and, in the case of the mission commander, control the drone swarm.},

ABSTRACT = {Intravenous (IV) infusion therapy allows the infusion fluid to be inserted directly into the patient’s vein. It is used to place medications directly into the bloodstream or for blood transfusions. The probability that a hospitalized patient will receive some kind of infusion therapy, intravenously, is 60–80%. The paper presents a smart IV infusion dosing system for detection, signaling, and monitoring of liquid in an IV bottle at a remote location. It consists of (i) the sensing and computation layer—a system for detection and signaling of fluid levels in the IV bottle and a system for regulation and closing of infusion flow, (ii) the communication layer—a wireless exchange of information between the hardware part of the system and the client, and (iii) the user layer—monitoring and visualization of IV therapy reception at a remote location in real time. All layers are modular, allowing upgrades of the entire system. The proposed system alerts medical staff to continuous and timely changes of IV bottles, which can have positive effects on increasing the success of IV therapy, especially in oncology patients. The prescribed drip time of IV chemotherapy for the full effect of cytostatics should be imperative.},

ABSTRACT = {Rail tracks undergo massive stresses that can affect their structural integrity and produce rail breakage. The last phenomenon represents a serious concern for railway management authorities, since it may cause derailments and, consequently, losses of rolling stock material and lives. Therefore, the activities of track maintenance and inspection are of paramount importance. In recent years, the use of various technologies for monitoring rails and the detection of their defects has been investigated; however, despite the important progresses in this field, substantial research efforts are still required to achieve higher scanning speeds and improve the reliability of diagnostic procedures. It is expected that, in the near future, an important role in track maintenance and inspection will be played by the ultrasonic guided wave technology. In this manuscript, its use in rail track monitoring is investigated in detail; moreover, both of the main strategies investigated in the technical literature are taken into consideration. The first strategy consists of the installation of the monitoring instrumentation on board a moving test vehicle that scans the track below while running. The second strategy, instead, is based on distributing the instrumentation throughout the entire rail network, so that continuous monitoring in quasi-real-time can be obtained. In our analysis of the proposed solutions, the prototypes and the employed methods are described.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper presents the results of an environmental assessment of a Nickel-Manganese-Cobalt (NMC) Lithium-ion traction battery for Battery Electric Light-Duty Commercial Vehicles (BEV-LDCV) used for urban and regional freight haulage. A cradle-to-grave Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) of NMC111 is provided, operation and end-of-life stages are included, and insight is also given into a Life Cycle Assessment of different NMC chemistries. The environmental impacts of the manufacturing stages of the NMC111 battery are then compared with those of a Sodium-Nickel-Chloride (ZEBRA) battery. In the second part of the work, two electric-battery LDCVs (powered with NMC111 and ZEBRA batteries, respectively) and a diesel urban LDCV are analysed, considering a wide set of environmental impact categories. The results show that the NMC111 battery has the highest impacts from production in most of the impact categories. Active cathode material, Aluminium, Copper, and energy use for battery production are the main contributors to the environmental impact. However, when vehicle application is investigated, NMC111-BEV shows lower environmental impacts, in all the impact categories, than ZEBRA-BEV. This is mainly due to the greater efficiency of the NMC111 battery during vehicle operation. Finally, when comparing BEVs to a diesel LDCV, the electric powertrains show advantages over the diesel one as far as global warming, abiotic depletion potential-fossil fuels, photochemical oxidation, and ozone layer depletion are concerned. However, the diesel LDCV performs better in almost all the other investigated impact categories.},

ABSTRACT = {The weight optimization of a structure can be conducted by using fewer and downsized components, applying lighter materials in production, and removing unwanted material. Topology optimization (TO) is one of the most implemented material removal processes. In addition, when it is oriented towards additive manufacturing (AM), it increases design flexibility. The traditional optimization approach is the compliance optimization, where the material layout of a structure is optimized by minimizing its overall compliance. However, TO, in its current state of the art, is mainly used for design inspiration and not for manufacturing due to design complexities and lack of accuracy of its design solutions. The authors, in this research paper, explore the benefits and the limitations of the TO using as a case study the housings of a front and a rear brake caliper. The calipers were optimized for weight reduction by implementing the aforementioned optimization procedure. Their housings were topologically optimized, partially redesigned, prepared for 3D printing, validated, and 3D printed in titanium using selective laser melting (SLM). The weight of the optimized calipers reduced by 41.6% compared to commercial calipers. Designers interested in either TO or in automotive engineering can exploit the findings in this paper.},

ABSTRACT = {To ensure the stability of flight, the butterfly needs to flap its wings and simultaneously move its main body to achieve all kinds of flying motion, such as taking off, hovering, or reverse flight. The high-speed camera is used to record the swing of the abdomen, the movement of the wings, and the pitch angle of the body for butterflies during their free flight; the comprehensive biokinetic observations show that the butterfly’s wings and body are coupled in various flight states. The swing of the abdomen and the flap of the fore wing affect the pitch motion significantly. For theoretical analysis of the butterfly flight, a three-dimensional multi-rigid butterfly model based on real butterfly dimension is established, and the aerodynamic of the butterfly flight is simulated and analyzed via computational fluid dynamics methods to obtain an optimal kinematic model of butterfly forward flight. Moreover, the formation and development of three-dimensional vortex structures in the forward flight are also presented. The detailed structures of vortices and their dynamic behavior show that the wing’s flap and the abdominal swing play a key role in reorienting and correcting the “clap and peel” mechanism, and the force generation mechanisms are evaluated. The research indicates that longitudinal flight performance is mainly related to the kinematic parameters of the wing and body, and it can lead to the development of butterfly-inspired flapping wing air vehicles.},

In contrast to other dynamic quadruped robots based on custom actuator and machined metal structural parts, the PADWQ is entirely built from off the shelf components and standard 3D printed plastic structural parts, which allows for a rapid distribution and duplication without the need for advanced machining process. To make sure that the plastic structural parts can withstand the stress of dynamic locomotion, we performed finite element analysis (FEA) on leg structural parts as well as a continuous walking test using the physical robot, both of which the robot has passed successfully. We hope this work to help a wide range of researchers and engineers that need an affordable, highly capable and easily customizable quadruped robot.},

ABSTRACT = {Geometrical tolerances are defined in the ISO Geometrical Product Specification system that is used worldwide, but on the other hand, the ASME Y14.5 standard is used in American companies to define how far actual parts may be away from their nominal geometry. This paper aimed to investigate whether specifications defining acceptable geometrical deviations in one system can be transformed to specifications in the other system. Twelve selected cases are discussed in the paper. Particularly, two cases of size tolerance, three cases of form tolerances, one case of orientation tolerance, four cases of position tolerance (including position tolerance with MMR for the pattern of five holes) and, finally, two cases of surface profile tolerance (unequally disposed tolerance zone and dynamic profile tolerance). The issue is not only in the several different symbols and a set of different defaults, but also in the different meanings and different application contexts of some symbols that have the same graphical form. The answer to the question raised in the paper title is yes for the majority of indications specified according to ASME Y14.5 when new tools from the 2017 edition of ISO 1101 are applied.},

ABSTRACT = {Fused deposition modeling (FDM) 3D printers commonly need support material to print overhangs. A previously developed 4-axis printing process based on an orthogonal kinematic, an additional rotational axis around the z-axis and a 45° tilted nozzle can print overhangs up to 100° without support material. With this approach, the layers are in a conical shape and no longer parallel to the printing plane; therefore, a new slicer strategy is necessary to generate the paths. This paper describes a slicing algorithm compatible with this 4-axis printing kinematics. The presented slicing strategy is a combination of a geometrical transformation with a conventional slicing software and has three basic steps: Transformation of the geometry in the .STL file, path generation with a conventional slicer and back transformation of the G-code. A comparison of conventionally manufactured parts and parts produced with the new process shows the feasibility and initial results in terms of surface quality and dimensional accuracy.},

ABSTRACT = {Recent progress of electric systems has raised attention towards hybrid-electric and full-electric aircraft. Nevertheless, the current low battery energy density limits the application of these propulsive architectures to large transport aircraft. In the context of the general aviation category, full-electric aircraft for the so-called Urban Air Mobility scenario are gaining increasing interest. These air taxis, also called e-VTOL, are conceived to exploit vertical take-off and landing capabilities, to carry people from one point to another, typically within the same city. In this paper, a new conceptual design methodology for urban air vehicles is presented and applied to an innovative convertiplane, called TiltOne, based on a box-wing architecture coupled with tilt-wing mechanisms. Several TiltOne configurations have been designed according to the current regulations imposed by European Union Aviation Safety Agency, and sensitivity analyses have been carried out on the varying main design parameters, such as wing loading and propellers’ disk loading, as well as main top-level aircraft requirements. The results provide an overview for today’s operational capabilities of such aircraft and, in addition, depict possible scenarios for a near-future horizon, based on the assumption of increased performance levels for the electric powertrain components. In such scenario, two different concepts of operations are analysed and discussed: the first is based on a given design range, long enough to cover the urban distances; the second is conceived to exploit the capability of flying multiple shorter missions with a single battery charge. The designed TiltOne configurations derived from these different approaches are presented, highlighting their potential capabilities and possible drawbacks.},

ABSTRACT = {A brake disc decelerates the vehicle through friction with the brake pads. When the brake system is overheated, brake fade can occur, in which the friction coefficient drops significantly. Additionally, an over-heated brake system may cause vapor lock, in which the brake hydraulic fluid is vaporized. These phenomena can lead to the loss of braking power and cause a fatal accident. Therefore, brake systems must have stable braking and heat dissipation performance. Having through-holes and slits on the friction surface of the rotor has been adopted to improve the heat dissipation performance, but the holes become stress points and potentially cause cracks. Therefore, brake systems should be designed to have structural stability as well as good heat dissipation. In this study, finite element (FE) modeling was developed to analyze the structural stability and heat dissipation performance of a brake system, and structural and thermal simulations were performed in ANSYS, a CAE software package. In addition, to minimize concentrated stress and temperature, optimal design of the shape and pattern of holes and slits was carried out using PIAnO, an integrated optimal design software package. The first step of design optimization was performed while considering the shape and pattern of the disc holes and slits as design factors. Among the design factors, those with the largest effects on the objective functions were found and set as new design factors to perform the second step. The designs were compared to existing discs. Through the optimization presented in this paper, it is expected that the performance of the braking system will improve and the life of the brake parts will be increased.},

ABSTRACT = {Exoskeleton robots are electrically, pneumatically, or hydraulically actuated devices that externally support the bones and cartilage of the human body while trying to mimic the human movement capabilities and augment muscle power. The lower extremity exoskeleton device may support specific human joints such as hip, knee, and ankle, or provide support to carry and balance the weight of the full upper body. Their assistive functionality for physically-abled and disabled humans is demanded in medical, industrial, military, safety applications, and other related fields. The vision of humans walking with an exoskeleton without external support is the prospect of the robotics and artificial intelligence working groups. This paper presents a survey on the design and control of lower extremity exoskeletons for bipedal walking. First, a historical view on the development of walking exoskeletons is presented and various lower body exoskeleton designs are categorized in different application areas. Then, these designs are studied from design, modeling, and control viewpoints. Finally, a discussion on future research directions is provided.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper proposes a design methodology for a six-wheeled rover that adapt to different stairs and maintain its stability based on the robot’s parameters, the kinematics constraints, the maximum height, and the minimum length of the step required to climb up and down. We also propose an emergency controller to prevent falls during the climb up or down using the contact angle measurement between wheel–ground by a laser scanner sensor on each side of the robot. Thus, the geometry terrain information and the wheel contact loss detection with the ground can be obtained. This loss of contact with the ground is a determining factor in an emergency case where the robot’s stability is at risk. Therefore, the controllers kick in to regain the wheel contact with the step, preventing the robot from falling. Simulations and experimental results when the robot climbs up and down stairs demonstrate the ability to react to possible falls.},

ABSTRACT = {The rise of Industry 4.0, which employs emerging powerful and intelligent technologies and represents the digital transformation of manufacturing, has a significant impact on society, industry, and other production sectors. The industrial scene is witnessing ever-increasing pressure to improve its agility and versatility to accommodate the highly modularized, customized, and dynamic demands of production. One of the key concepts within Industry 4.0 is the smart factory, which represents a manufacturing/production system with interconnected processes and operations via cyber-physical systems, the Internet of Things, and state-of-the-art digital technologies. This paper outlines the design of a smart cyber-physical system that complies with the innovative smart factory framework for Industry 4.0 and implements the core industrial, computing, information, and communication technologies of the smart factory. It discusses how to combine the key components (pillars) of a smart factory to create an intelligent manufacturing system. As a demonstration of a simplified smart factory model, a smart manufacturing case study with a drilling process is implemented, and the feasibility of the proposed method is demonstrated and verified with experiments.},
