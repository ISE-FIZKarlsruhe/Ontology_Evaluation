The optimization of the geometry of a centrifugal fan is performed at maximum power and high-efficiency design points (DPs) to improve impeller efficiency. Two design variables defining the shape of fan blade are selected for the optimization. The optimal values of the geometry parameters of the impeller blades are identified by employing virtual flow simulations. The results of virtual experiments indicate the influence of the parameters of the blade geometry on its efficiency. With the optimization of impeller blade geometry, the efficiency of the fan is improved with respect to the reference model, as confirmed by comparing the performance curves. Herein, we discuss the results obtained in virtual tests by identifying the influence of DPs on the performance characteristics of centrifugal fans.
