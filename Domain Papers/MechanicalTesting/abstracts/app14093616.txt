Trochoidal milling is one of the solutions for increasing the efficiency of machining processes. A decreased cutting toolâ€™s arc of contact leads to a reduction in the generated cutting forces, thus improving process stability. Vibration is an inherent part of any machining process, affecting the accuracy and quality of the manufactured components, but it can also pose a danger to machine operators. Chatter is particularly detrimental, leaving characteristic marks on shaped surfaces and potentially leading to catastrophic tool damage. Therefore, it is important to ensure the stability of machining and also reduce vibration. The primary purpose of the conducted research is to evaluate the stability of the milling process of the AZ91D magnesium alloy performed through a trochoidal strategy. An additional objective is to establish the effect of the variation in machining parameters and toolholder types on milling stability. Three types of toolholders most commonly used in industry are used in the study. The basis of the investigation is the measurement of vibration displacement and acceleration analysed in the time domain. A spectral analysis of the signals is also performed based on Fast Fourier Transform, to identify signal components and detect the susceptibility to chatter occurrence. An important part of the study is also an attempt to use the Composite Multiscale Entropy as an indicator to determine the stability of the machining processes. Entropy does not exceed the values of 1.5 for cutting speed and 2.5 for feed per tooth, respectively. Vibration acceleration does not exceed (in most cases) the value of 20 m/s2 for the peak-to-peak parameter and the shrinkfit toolholder. For vibration displacement (peak-to-peak parameter), there are oscillations around the value of 0.9 mm for all kinds of toolholders.
