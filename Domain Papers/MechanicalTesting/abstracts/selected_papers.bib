 abstract = {(1) Objective: External fixation systems are commonly used by surgeons to ensure stabilization and consolidation of bone fractures, especially in patients who are at high risk for systematic complications. Both rigid and elastic external fixations are important in the fracture healing process. This study aims to evaluate the behavior of the Orthofix Limb Reconstruction System (LRS)® in the dynamic compression mode. (2) Methods: Experimental and numerical setups were developed using a simplified model of a human tibia which consisted of a nylon bar with a diameter of 30 mm. The bone callus was included in both setups by means of a load cell-based system, which consisted of two carbon epoxy laminated composite plates with a final stiffness of 220 N/mm. The system was evaluated experimentally and numerically, considering different numbers of pins and comparing distances between the external fixator frame and the bone, achieving a good correlation between experimental and numerical results. (3) Results: The results identified and quantified the percental load transferred to the fracture and its sensibility to the distance between the external fixator and bone. Additionally, LRS locking stiffness was evaluated which resulted from the clamp-rail clearances. The results show that the blocking effects of the free clamp movement are directly related to the fixator configuration and are responsible for changes in the amount of load that crosses the bone callus. (4) Conclusions: From the biomechanical point of view, the results suggest that the average bending span of Schanz pins and the weights of the patients should be included into clinical studies of external fixators comparisons purpose.},

 abstract = {As regulations on the emission of pollutants from combustion systems are further tightened, it is necessary to reduce pollutant species and improve combustion efficiency to completely understand the process in the combustion field. Tunable diode laser absorption tomography (TDLAT) is a powerful tool that can analyze two-dimensional (2D) temperature and species concentration with fast-response and non-contact. In this study, stabilized spectra were implemented using the mean periodic signal technique to enable real-time 2D temperature measurement in harsh conditions. A time series statistical-based verification algorithm was introduced to select an optimal spectral cycle to track 2D reconstruction temperature. The statistical-based verification is based on the Two-sample t test, root mean square error, and time-based Mahalanobis distance, which is a technique for similarity analysis between thermocouple and reconstruction temperature of 18 candidate cycles. As a result, it was observed that the statistical-based TDLAT contribute to improving the accuracy of time series-based 2D temperature measurements.},

A rolling bearing clustering fault diagnosis method based on ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD), permutation entropy (PE), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and the Gath–Geva (GG) clustering algorithm is proposed. Firstly, we decompose the vibration signal using EEMD, and several inherent modal components are obtained. Then, the permutation entropy values of each modal component are calculated to get the entropy feature vector, and the entropy feature vector is reduced by the LDA method to be used as the input of the clustering algorithm. The data experiments show that the proposed fault diagnosis method can obtain satisfactory clustering indicators. It implies that compared with other mode combination methods, the fault identification method proposed in this study has the advantage of better intra-class compactness of clustering results.},

 abstract = {In this paper, a blockchain-based data sharing and access control system is proposed, for communication between the Internet of Things (IoT) devices. The proposed system is intended to overcome the issues related to trust and authentication for access control in IoT networks. Moreover, the objectives of the system are to achieve trustfulness, authorization, and authentication for data sharing in IoT networks. Multiple smart contracts such as Access Control Contract (ACC), Register Contract (RC), and Judge Contract (JC) are used to provide efficient access control management. Where ACC manages overall access control of the system, and RC is used to authenticate users in the system, JC implements the behavior judging method for detecting misbehavior of a subject (i.e., user). After the misbehavior detection, a penalty is defined for that subject. Several permission levels are set for IoT devices’ users to share services with others. In the end, performance of the proposed system is analyzed by calculating cost consumption rate of smart contracts and their functions. A comparison is made between existing and proposed systems. Results show that the proposed system is efficient in terms of cost. The overall execution cost of the system is 6,900,000 gas units and the transaction cost is 5,200,000 gas units.},

 abstract = {Workload control mechanisms are widely studied in the literature for the control of job-shop systems. The control of these systems involves acceptance, order release and priority dispatching. At the release level, the workload norm controls the “enters” of the jobs; it is relevant how the aggregate workload is computed. Few works have studied new computation methods of the aggregate workload but use the adjusted aggregate workload proposed in the literature. This paper proposes a dynamically adjusted aggregate workload to improve the performance of the workload control mechanism in job-shop systems. The adjusted aggregate workload is updated when each part exits from a workstation; this means that the workload used to release the orders is related to the state of the job shop in real-time. Simulation is used to evaluate and compare the proposed model to the classical models proposed in the literature. The simulation experiments demonstrate improvement of performance and how the model proposed is robust under different manufacturing system conditions.},

Process planning in AM involving various AM technologies is also complicated and scarce. Thus, this study proposed a decision-support tool that integrates production and distribution planning in AM involving material extrusion (ME), stereolithography (SLA), and selective laser sintering (SLS). A multi-objective optimization approach was used to schedule component batches to a network of AM printers. Next, the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) technique was used to analyze trade-offs among conflicting criteria. The developed model was then demonstrated in a decision-support system environment to enhance practitioners’ applications. Then, the developed model was verified through a case study using automotive and healthcare parts. Finally, an experimental design was conducted to evaluate the complexity of the model and computation time by varying the number of parts, printer types, and distribution locations.},

The richness of real-world data required for testing autonomous vehicles is limited and furthermore, available data do not present a fair representation of different scenarios and rare events. Before deploying autonomous vehicles publicly, their abilities must reach a safety threshold, not least with regards to vulnerable road users, such as pedestrians. In this paper, we present a novel Generative Adversarial Networks named the Ped-Cross GAN. Ped-Cross GAN is able to generate crossing sequences of pedestrians in the form of human pose sequences. The Ped-Cross GAN is trained with the Pedestrian Scenario dataset. The novel Pedestrian Scenario dataset, derived from existing datasets, enables training on richer pedestrian scenarios. We demonstrate an example of its use through training and testing the Ped-Cross GAN. The results show that the Ped-Cross GAN is able to generate new crossing scenarios that are of the same distribution from those contained in the Pedestrian Scenario dataset. Having a method with these capabilities is important for the future of transport, as it will allow for the adequate testing of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles on how they correctly perceive the intention of pedestrians crossing the street, ultimately leading to fewer pedestrian casualties on our roads.},

 abstract = {Assembly path planning of complex products in virtual assembly is a necessary and complicated step, which will become long and inefficient if the assembly path of each part is completely planned in the assembly space. The coincidence or partial coincidence of the assembly paths of some parts provides an opportunity to solve this problem. A path planning algorithm based on prior path reuse (PPR algorithm) is proposed in this paper, which realizes rapid planning of an assembly path by reusing the planned paths. The core of the PPR algorithm is a dual-tree fusion strategy for path reuse, which is implemented by improving the rapidly exploring random tree star (RRT *) algorithm. The dual-tree fusion strategy is used to find the nearest prior node, the prior connection node, the nearest exploring node, and the exploring connection node and to connect the exploring tree to the prior tree after the exploring tree is extended to the prior space. Then, the optimal path selection strategy is used to calculate the costs of all planned paths and select the one with the minimum cost as the optimal path. The PPR algorithm is compared with the RRT * algorithm in path planning for one start node and multiple start nodes. The results show that the total time and the number of sampling points for assembly path planning of batch parts using the PPR algorithm are far less than those using the RRT * algorithm.},

Interaction with a hypothetical operator in charge of the work to be performed is implemented with the use of augmented reality. In fact, through an application programmed for an Android device (in this case, a mobile phone, hence a handheld device), the operator can be instructed step-by-step on the disassembly sequence in dynamics as an animation. Finally, two virtual buttons were added in augmented reality with which the operator can start and pause/resume the animation at any time to facilitate the understanding of the different steps established by the sequence.},

Meanwhile, the prognostic aspect utilizes AdaBoost regressors, also acting as weak learners trained on the same features, to predict the machine’s future state and estimate its remaining useful life. A key contribution of this approach is its ability to address the challenge of limited historical data for electrical equipment by optimizing AdaBoost parameters with minimal data.

Through illustrative examples using experimental data, the efficacy of this method in identifying malfunctions and precisely forecasting the remaining lifespan of DC motors is demonstrated.},

 abstract = {Trochoidal milling is one of the solutions for increasing the efficiency of machining processes. A decreased cutting tool’s arc of contact leads to a reduction in the generated cutting forces, thus improving process stability. Vibration is an inherent part of any machining process, affecting the accuracy and quality of the manufactured components, but it can also pose a danger to machine operators. Chatter is particularly detrimental, leaving characteristic marks on shaped surfaces and potentially leading to catastrophic tool damage. Therefore, it is important to ensure the stability of machining and also reduce vibration. The primary purpose of the conducted research is to evaluate the stability of the milling process of the AZ91D magnesium alloy performed through a trochoidal strategy. An additional objective is to establish the effect of the variation in machining parameters and toolholder types on milling stability. Three types of toolholders most commonly used in industry are used in the study. The basis of the investigation is the measurement of vibration displacement and acceleration analysed in the time domain. A spectral analysis of the signals is also performed based on Fast Fourier Transform, to identify signal components and detect the susceptibility to chatter occurrence. An important part of the study is also an attempt to use the Composite Multiscale Entropy as an indicator to determine the stability of the machining processes. Entropy does not exceed the values of 1.5 for cutting speed and 2.5 for feed per tooth, respectively. Vibration acceleration does not exceed (in most cases) the value of 20 m/s2 for the peak-to-peak parameter and the shrinkfit toolholder. For vibration displacement (peak-to-peak parameter), there are oscillations around the value of 0.9 mm for all kinds of toolholders.},

The factor that limits the performance and operating range of compressors is flow instability. Many ideas have been put forward for performance improvement, but tandem blade radial compressors, which do not require an extra air system, have attracted the most interest. In this study, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analyses were carried out on various parameters of the tandem blade (TB) radial compressor, and an optimization study was carried out to find the best design using a genetic algorithm on a whole operating curve. It was investigated how these parameters affected the efficiency and total pressure ratio between the determined lower and upper limits. The numerical analyses of the optimum design obtained as a result of the iterations were carried out. As a result of the iterations, three optimum designs were obtained and numerical analysis was carried out according to one of them, and then they were compared with the results in the literature. The general agreement of computational fluid dynamics and the literature data served as a validation for the computational approach. The error rates between the numerical analysis results and the experimental results in the literature were calculated for different flow rates and were found to be 1.98% as the highest and 0.35 as the lowest. The work carried out in this article will provide a valuable reference for future advanced tandem blade compressor designs.},

 abstract = {High-speed, pressure-compensated variable displacement piston pumps are widely used in aircraft hydraulic systems for their high power density. The swash plate is controlled by the pressure-compensated valve, which uses pressure feedback so that the instantaneous output flow of the pump is exactly enough to maintain a presetting pressure. The oscillation of the swash plate is one of the major excitation sources in the high-speed piston pump, which may cause lower efficiency, shorter service life, and even serious damage. This paper presents an improved model to investigate the influence of the variable displacement mechanism on the swash plate oscillation and introduces some feasible ways to reduce oscillation of the swash plate. Most of the variable structural parameters of the variable displacement mechanism are taken into consideration, and their influences on swash plate oscillation are discussed in detail. The influence of the load pipe on the oscillation of the swash plate is considered in the improved model. A test rig is built and similarities between the experiments and simulated results prove that the simulation model can effectively predict the variable displacement mechanism state. The simulation results show that increasing the volume of the outlet chamber, the spring stiffness of the control valve, the action area of the actuator piston, and offset distance of the actuator piston can significantly reduce the oscillation amplitude of the swash plate. Furthermore, reducing the diameter of the control valve spool and the dead volume of the actuator piston chamber can also have a positive effect on oscillation amplitude reduction.},

 abstract = {In many site investigation phases of civil and mining engineering projects, the tensile strength of the rocks is one of the most significant parameters that must be identified. This parameter can be determined directly through laboratory tests. However, conducting such laboratory tests is costly and time consuming. In this paper, a new artificial neural network (ANN)-based model is developed to predict rock tensile strength, using the invasive weed optimization (IWO) technique. Granite samples for the purpose of this research were selected from a tunnel located in Malaysia and underwent appropriate laboratory tests (i.e., Schmidt hammer, point load, dry density, as well as the Brazilian tensile strength (BTS) as system output). A simple regression analysis was carried out, and the obtained results confirmed the need for developing a model with multiple inputs, rather than one with only a single input, in order to predict BTS values. Aiming to highlight the capability of an IWO-ANN model in estimating BTS, artificial bee colony (ABC)-ANN and imperialism competitive algorithm (ICA)-ANN were also applied and developed. The parameters required for the ANN-based models were obtained using different parametric studies. According to calculated performance indices, a new hybrid IWO-ANN model can provide a higher accuracy level for the prediction of BTS compared to the ABC-ANN and ICA-ANN models. The results showed that the IWO-ANN model is a suitable alternative solution for a robust and reliable engineering design.},
