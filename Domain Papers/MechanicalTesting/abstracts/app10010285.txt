As regulations on the emission of pollutants from combustion systems are further tightened, it is necessary to reduce pollutant species and improve combustion efficiency to completely understand the process in the combustion field. Tunable diode laser absorption tomography (TDLAT) is a powerful tool that can analyze two-dimensional (2D) temperature and species concentration with fast-response and non-contact. In this study, stabilized spectra were implemented using the mean periodic signal technique to enable real-time 2D temperature measurement in harsh conditions. A time series statistical-based verification algorithm was introduced to select an optimal spectral cycle to track 2D reconstruction temperature. The statistical-based verification is based on the Two-sample t test, root mean square error, and time-based Mahalanobis distance, which is a technique for similarity analysis between thermocouple and reconstruction temperature of 18 candidate cycles. As a result, it was observed that the statistical-based TDLAT contribute to improving the accuracy of time series-based 2D temperature measurements.
