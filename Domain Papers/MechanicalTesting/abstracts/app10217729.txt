In the present study, a novel approach to estimating the efficiency of roller chain power transmission systems is proposed based on sliding friction losses and damping force. The dynamics model is taken into account between chain links with lateral offset owing to the derailleur system. Frictional losses were calculated according to Coulombâ€™s law of friction, and the damping force was dependent on the damping coefficient. The effects of rotational speed, load, derailleur system, and damping coefficient on transmission efficiency were analyzed. The test stand of the roller chain power transmission system was set up to verify the estimated efficiency, and the results showed a good correlation, demonstrating the validity of the chain power transmission efficiency estimation.
