In many site investigation phases of civil and mining engineering projects, the tensile strength of the rocks is one of the most significant parameters that must be identified. This parameter can be determined directly through laboratory tests. However, conducting such laboratory tests is costly and time consuming. In this paper, a new artificial neural network (ANN)-based model is developed to predict rock tensile strength, using the invasive weed optimization (IWO) technique. Granite samples for the purpose of this research were selected from a tunnel located in Malaysia and underwent appropriate laboratory tests (i.e., Schmidt hammer, point load, dry density, as well as the Brazilian tensile strength (BTS) as system output). A simple regression analysis was carried out, and the obtained results confirmed the need for developing a model with multiple inputs, rather than one with only a single input, in order to predict BTS values. Aiming to highlight the capability of an IWO-ANN model in estimating BTS, artificial bee colony (ABC)-ANN and imperialism competitive algorithm (ICA)-ANN were also applied and developed. The parameters required for the ANN-based models were obtained using different parametric studies. According to calculated performance indices, a new hybrid IWO-ANN model can provide a higher accuracy level for the prediction of BTS compared to the ABC-ANN and ICA-ANN models. The results showed that the IWO-ANN model is a suitable alternative solution for a robust and reliable engineering design.
