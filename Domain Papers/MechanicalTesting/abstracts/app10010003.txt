(1) Objective: External fixation systems are commonly used by surgeons to ensure stabilization and consolidation of bone fractures, especially in patients who are at high risk for systematic complications. Both rigid and elastic external fixations are important in the fracture healing process. This study aims to evaluate the behavior of the Orthofix Limb Reconstruction System (LRS)Â® in the dynamic compression mode. (2) Methods: Experimental and numerical setups were developed using a simplified model of a human tibia which consisted of a nylon bar with a diameter of 30 mm. The bone callus was included in both setups by means of a load cell-based system, which consisted of two carbon epoxy laminated composite plates with a final stiffness of 220 N/mm. The system was evaluated experimentally and numerically, considering different numbers of pins and comparing distances between the external fixator frame and the bone, achieving a good correlation between experimental and numerical results. (3) Results: The results identified and quantified the percental load transferred to the fracture and its sensibility to the distance between the external fixator and bone. Additionally, LRS locking stiffness was evaluated which resulted from the clamp-rail clearances. The results show that the blocking effects of the free clamp movement are directly related to the fixator configuration and are responsible for changes in the amount of load that crosses the bone callus. (4) Conclusions: From the biomechanical point of view, the results suggest that the average bending span of Schanz pins and the weights of the patients should be included into clinical studies of external fixators comparisons purpose.
