This study introduces a novel predictive methodology for diagnosing and predicting gear problems in DC motors. Leveraging AdaBoost with weak classifiers and regressors, the diagnostic aspect categorizes the machine’s current operational state by analyzing time–frequency features extracted from motor current signals. AdaBoost classifiers are employed as weak learners to effectively identify fault severity conditions. Meanwhile, the prognostic aspect utilizes AdaBoost regressors, also acting as weak learners trained on the same features, to predict the machine’s future state and estimate its remaining useful life. A key contribution of this approach is its ability to address the challenge of limited historical data for electrical equipment by optimizing AdaBoost parameters with minimal data. Experimental validation is conducted using a dedicated setup to collect comprehensive data. Through illustrative examples using experimental data, the efficacy of this method in identifying malfunctions and precisely forecasting the remaining lifespan of DC motors is demonstrated.
