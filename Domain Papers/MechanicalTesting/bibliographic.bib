ABSTRACT = {(1) Objective: External fixation systems are commonly used by surgeons to ensure stabilization and consolidation of bone fractures, especially in patients who are at high risk for systematic complications. Both rigid and elastic external fixations are important in the fracture healing process. This study aims to evaluate the behavior of the Orthofix Limb Reconstruction System (LRS)® in the dynamic compression mode. (2) Methods: Experimental and numerical setups were developed using a simplified model of a human tibia which consisted of a nylon bar with a diameter of 30 mm. The bone callus was included in both setups by means of a load cell-based system, which consisted of two carbon epoxy laminated composite plates with a final stiffness of 220 N/mm. The system was evaluated experimentally and numerically, considering different numbers of pins and comparing distances between the external fixator frame and the bone, achieving a good correlation between experimental and numerical results. (3) Results: The results identified and quantified the percental load transferred to the fracture and its sensibility to the distance between the external fixator and bone. Additionally, LRS locking stiffness was evaluated which resulted from the clamp-rail clearances. The results show that the blocking effects of the free clamp movement are directly related to the fixator configuration and are responsible for changes in the amount of load that crosses the bone callus. (4) Conclusions: From the biomechanical point of view, the results suggest that the average bending span of Schanz pins and the weights of the patients should be included into clinical studies of external fixators comparisons purpose.},

ABSTRACT = {Skid damage affects the performance of aviation bearing, which covers different disciplines in tribology, thermology, materials science, dynamics, et al. In this manuscript, a novel horizontal skid damage test rig of a rolling bearing with higher rotation accuracy and better linear contact was built, which can simulate the rolling/sliding contact between the roller and inner ring. Combining with temperature, load, speed, slip, and surface microscopy, the skid damage mechanism of roller bearings was analyzed from a multi-information perspective. Meanwhile, the dynamic lubrication failure process of the contact pair in rolling bearings with the time-varying slip and temperature distribution was revealed. The effect of different radial loads, inner ring speeds, lubricating oil quantities, and states of cleanliness on the time-varying characteristics of the temperature and the slip of the rolling bearing were obtained. Among them, the radial load has the greatest influence on the slip rate of rolling bearing. In addition, the test results show that the skid damage under extremely light load is the comprehensive effect of adhesive wear and thermal failure.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper proposes a self-insulating joint design based on the cable-driven parallel-series (CDPS) mechanism and electrical insulation analysis. The design provides the motions, mechanic support, and electrical insulation for robotic arms in live-line operation, which can maintain the equipment without manual intervention and power interruption. This CDPS mechanism can integrate four degrees of freedom (DOFs) motion in one joint, while the traditional series joint can only realize one DOF independently. The cable forces in the CDPS are calculated by the inverse kinematics to ensure the safe and flexible operation of the mechanism. The self-insulating joint has certain advantages over other designs because the electrical insulation is integrated into the joint instead of the traditional extra insulation layer. This integration reduces the weight of the arm mechanic structure. In addition, the structural complexity and weight are further reduced by separating the actuators and motors from the joint by using CDPS. Electric field distribution near the joint is calculated by the charge simulation method to analyze the insulation performance under the voltage of 35 kV. The cable forces and electric field distribution of the mechanism are measured to validate the simulation models. The inverse kinematics and insulation models of the self-insulating joint can provide detailed information for the mechanic and insulation design of the robotic arms.},

ABSTRACT = {Micro underwater vehicles (MUVs) have been highlighted recently for underwater explorations because of their high maneuverability, low price, great flexibility, etc. The thrusters of most conventional MUVs are driven by electromagnetic motors, which need big mechanical transmission parts and are prone to being interrupted by the variance of ambient electromagnetic fields. In this paper, a novel dual-rotor ultrasonic motor with double output shafts, compact size, and no electromagnetic interference is presented, characterized, and applied for actuating underwater robots. This motor was composed of a spindle-shaped stator, pre-pressure modulation unit, and dual rotors, which can output two simultaneous rotations to increase the propulsion force of the MUV. The pre-pressure modulation unit utilized a torsion spring to adjust the preload at the contact faces between the stator and rotor. The working principle of the ultrasonic motor was developed and the vibration mode of the stator was analyzed by the finite element method. Experimental results show that the no-load rotary speed and stalling torque of the prototype ultrasonic motor were 110 r/min and 3 mN·m, respectively, with 150 V peak-to-peak driving voltage at resonance. One underwater robot model equipped with the proposed ultrasonic motor-powered thruster could move at 33 mm/s immersed in water. The dual-rotor ultrasonic motor proposed here provides another alternative for driving MUVs and is appropriate for developing specific MUVs when the electromagnetic interference issue needs to be considered.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper addresses the uncertainty analysis in the case of a coordinate measuring machine. The main goal was analyzing, quantifying, and drawing conclusions on the influence of key factors and their interactions on the measurements’ uncertainty of the variable’s parallelism, angularity, roundness, diameter, and distance. In order to achieve this goal, a Random Factorial Design of Experiments was designed and implemented. It focused on the factors Stylus diameter, Step width, and Speed using three random levels each. For the solution of the experiment, an analysis of variance was used. The study was carried out on the coordinate measuring machine (CMM) ZEISS CenterMax. It was concluded that the interaction effects among Stylus diameter, Step width, and Speed were active at a confidence level of 95%. Besides, it was possible to estimate random factors‘ variance and their contribution to the total variation. Among the main effects, the Stylus diameter showed to be the one with the biggest influence. The paper also quantifies the influence in the measurement uncertainty, where the highest value of standard uncertainty belonged to the Stylus diameter in the evaluation of the variable’s angularity and diameter. Besides, the Speed factor was proved to have the biggest influence on the roundness’ measurement and evaluation.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper presents an adaptive time-delayed control based on the sliding-mode (ATDC-SM). The proposed ATDC-SM provides a new adaptive law imposing time-varying boundedness that is developed to adjust the control gains appropriately while suppressing the negative impact generated by the robot manipulators. Moreover, the control gains are constructed as a continuous function with a fast adaptation rate and hence can remedy chattering and fluctuation inherent in the existing adaptive time-delayed control. These synergistic effects provide a fast convergence rate while producing stable control gains. Besides, the proposed ATDC-SM uses one-sample delayed estimation to cancel out complex nonlinear dynamics and unknown disturbances. Thus, it produces a simple structure but effective approach due to this estimation. From these benefits, the proposed ATDC-SM provides precise tracking performance without undesired side effects. It is shown that the tracking errors are uniformly ultimately bounded through a Lyapunov function. The effectiveness of the proposed ATDC-SM is illustrated through simulation with a one-link robot manipulator, which is compared to that of the existing control approaches.},

ABSTRACT = {Hepatic cancers represent an important worldwide health issue where surgery alone in most cases is not a feasible therapeutic solution since most tumors are non-resectable. Despite targeted therapies showing positive results in other areas of cancer treatment, in the case of liver tumors, no low-risk delivery methods have been identified. Based on a risk assessment approach, this paper proposes a technical solution in the form of a robotic system capable of achieving a reliable delivery method for targeted treatment, focusing on the patient safety and therapeutic efficiency. The design of the robotic system starts from the definition of the design constraints with respect to the medical protocol. An analytical hierarchy process is used to prioritize the data correlated with the technical characteristics of a new robotic system, aiming to minimize risks associated with the medical procedure. In a four-phase quality function deployment, the technical solution is evaluated with respect to the quality characteristics, functions, subsystems, and components aiming to achieve a safe and reliable system with high therapeutic efficiency. The results lead to the concept of HeRo, a parallel robotic system for the reliable targeted treatment of non-resectable liver tumors.},

ABSTRACT = {Robust and efficient Cartesian mesh generation for large-scale scene is of great significance for fluid dynamics simulation and collision detection. High-quality and large-scale mesh generation task in a personal computer is hard to achieve. In this paper, a parallel Cartesian mesh generation algorithm based on graphics processing unit (GPU) is proposed. The proposed algorithm is optimized based on the traditional ray casting method in computer graphics, and is more efficient and stable for large-scale Cartesian mesh generation. In the process of mesh generation, the geometries represented by triangular facets are transformed into a mesh composed of orthogonal hexahedrons. A parallel ray generation method is proposed to reduce the data exchange between the host memory and device memory. A parallel primitives searching method based on lattice grid is adopted to search the triangular facets for intersection calculation between rays and triangles. The parallel Cartesian mesh generation algorithm has been implemented using CUDA library. The performance of parallel Cartesian mesh generation algorithm has been promoted enormously compared with the traditional the sequential algorithm, which is shown in different numerical experiments. Through some tests, the performance of parallel algorithm is analyzed, and the results show that the parallel computing power of the GPU is fully utilized. Finally, examples of Cartesian mesh generation are presented.},

ABSTRACT = {The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of milling and brushing cutting data settings on the surface geometry and energy parameters of two Mg alloy substrates: AZ91D and AZ31. In milling, the cutting speed and the trochoidal step were modified (vc = 400–1200 m/min and str = 5–30%) to investigate how they affect selected 2D (Rz, Rku, Rsk, RSm, Ra) and 3D (Sa, Sz, Sku, Ssk) roughness parameters. The brushing treatment was carried out at constant parameters: n = 5000 rev/min, vf = 300 mm/min, ap = 0.5 mm. The surface roughness of specimens was assessed with the Ra, Rz, and RSm parameters. The effects of the two treatments on the workpiece surface were analyzed comparatively. It was found that the roughness properties of the machined surface may be improved by the application of a carbide milling cutter and ceramic brush. The use of different machining data was also shown to impact the surface free energy and its polar component of Mg alloy specimens. Complementary to the results from the experimental part of the study, the investigated machining processes were modelled by means of statistical artificial neural networks (the radial basis function and multi-layered perceptron). The artificial neural networks (ANNs) were shown to perform well as a tool for the prediction of Mg alloy surface roughness parameters and the maximum height of the profile (Rz) after milling and brushing.},

EGTs are presented by corresponding double bicolor graphs (DBGs) and they are sorted into 13 groups in accordance with the degree of freedom (DOF) of DBGs and the degree of hollow vertices. Then, structural characteristics of obtained EGTs, which are used to detect whether the EGTs obtained in the future can be used in ATs, are analyzed and summarized. Finally, a new approach is proposed to obtain new configurations of the EGTs with one main shaft based on the transformation relation between DBG and the basic graph. Several examples are presented to illustrate the validity of the proposed approach.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper presents the design of a precise “ball-column” device to efficiently and accurately measure the geometric error terms of both rotary axes of the five-axis machine tool. A geometric error measurement method of spherical contact was proposed based on the influence of the geometric error term from a five-axis machine tool rotating axis on the integrated geometric error of the machine tool. A multiple degree of freedom, step-by-step contact method based on on-machine measure for measuring the spherical center point is proposed, and the solution formula of each geometric error term of the rotating axis is established, respectively. This method can identify 12 geometric errors based on the influence of one rotating axis on another rotating axis after long term operation. The spatial error field of the five-axis machine tool was constructed by analyzing the error law of the two rotating axes of machine tools based on various positions and postures. Finally, after the comparison of the experiment, the results showed that the accuracy of the developed error measurement device reached 91.8% and the detection time was as short as 30–40 min.},

ABSTRACT = {To effectively detect and identify the anomaly data in massive satellite telemetry data sets, the novel detection and identification method based on the pseudo-period was proposed in this paper. First, the raw data were compressed by extracting the shape salient points. Second, the compressed data were symbolized by the tilt angle of the adjacent data points. Based on this symbolization, the pseudo-period of the data was extracted. Third, the phase-plane trajectories corresponding to the pseudo-period data were obtained by using the pseudo-period as the basic analytical unit, and then, the phase-plane was divided into statistical regions. Finally, anomaly detection and identification of the raw data were achieved by analyzing the statistical values of the phase-plane trajectory points in each partition region. This method was verified by a simulation test that used the measured data of the satellite momentum wheel rotation. The simulation results showed that the proposed method could achieve the pseudo-period extraction of the measured data and the detection and identification of the anomalous telemetry data.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper presents an air-gap magnetic field manipulation by optimized coil currents for a magnetic force enhancement in electromechanical devices. The external coil is designed near the device air-gap for manipulating the magnetic field distribution. The distribution of external coil currents is then optimized for maximizing the magnetic force in the tangential direction to the air-gap line. For the optimization, the design domain near air-gap is divided into small areas, and design variables are assigned at each small design area. The design variables determines not only the strength of coil current density (i.e., number of coil turns) but also whether the material state is coil or iron. In a benchmark actuator example, it is shown that 11.12% force enhancement is available by manipulating the air-gap magnetic field distribution using the optimized coil current. By investigating the magnetic field distribution, it is confirmed that the optimized coil current manipulated the magnetic field, forwarding a focused and inclined distribution that is an ideal distribution for maximizing the magnetic force.},

ABSTRACT = {The effectiveness of shot peening is mainly determined by the peening coverage. The peening coverage is required to be 100% for current technical standards of shot peening. With the increase of material strength, higher peening coverage is required in shot peening process. However, the influence of high peening coverage on Almen intensity and residual compressive stress is unclear, the difficulty mainly lies in the lack of quantitative description of peening coverage in finite element analysis. To analyze the influence of high peening coverage on Almen intensity and residual compressive stress, firstly an approximate quantitative description of peening coverage based on dent size, the distance of shots and shot numbers is proposed in this study. Based on this quantitative description of peening coverage, the arc height and residual stress of the Almen test are simulated with the finite element method. The simulation results of arc height and saturation curve agree well with that of the Almen test, by which the effectiveness of the quantitative description and FE simulation are proved. The further study indicates that in shot peening processes, the excessive peening coverage doesn’t improve Almen intensity and residual compressive stress.},

In particular, the protection of materials from multiple extreme mechanical impacts imposes stringent requirements on the characteristics of energy absorption and recoverability. In this paper, a novel design of composite material, elastic polymer-modified porous carbon, is proposed to meet such urgent requirements. At the micro level, the polymer fibers form an elastic skeleton in which porous carbon particles are enveloped. Due to such microstructure, the composite material exhibits excellent performance of energy absorption and recoverability simultaneously, which are validated via various experiments. Furthermore, the microphysical mechanism of its superior energy absorption characteristics is demonstrated theoretically. Additionally, the optimized mass proportions of the two composite phases are discussed. In general, this novel design of energy absorbing material improves the reliability of electronic devices and systems exposed to multiple extreme mechanical impacts.},

ABSTRACT = {As the operating speed of a train increases, there is a growing interest in reducing damage caused by derailment and collision accidents. Since a collision with the surrounding structure after a derailment accident causes a great damage, protective facilities like a barrier wall or derailment containment provision (DCP) are installed to reduce the damage due to the secondary collision accident. However, the criteria to design a protective facility such as locations and design loads are not clear because of difficulties in predicting post-derailment behaviors. In this paper, we derived a simplified frame model that can predict post derailment behaviors in the design phase of the protective facilities. The proposed vehicle model can simplify for various frames to reduce the computation time. Also, the actual derailment tests were conducted on a real test track to verify the reliability of the model. The simulation results of the proposed model showed reasonable agreement to the test results.},

In particular, it predicts grain size and hardness variation by implementing a user subroutine involving a hardness-based flow stress and empirical models. The model is validated by comparing its output with the experimental results available in literature at varying the cutting speed, insert geometry and flank wear. The results show a good ability of the customized model to predict the thermo-mechanical and microstructural phenomena taking place during the selected processes.},

ABSTRACT = {The pros and cons of government subsidy policies in a closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) setting on optimal pricing, investment decisions in improving product quality, and used product collection under social welfare (SW) optimization goal have not been examined comprehensively. This study compares the outcomes of three government policies under manufacturer-Stackelberg (MS) and retailer-Stackelberg (RS), namely (i) direct subsidy to the consumer, (ii) subsidy to the manufacturer to stimulate used product collection, and (iii) subsidy to the manufacturer to improve product quality. Results demonstrate that the greening level, used product collection, and SW are always higher under the RS game, but the rate of a subsidy granted by the government is always higher under the MS game. Profits for the CLSC members and SW are always higher if the government provides a subsidy directly to the consumer, but productivity of investment in the perspective of the manufacturer or government are less. In a second policy, the government organizations grant a subsidy to the manufacturer to stimulate used product collection, but it does not necessarily yield the desired outcome compared to others. In a third policy, the manufacturer receives a subsidy on a research and development (R&D) investment, but it yields a sub-optimal greening level. This study reveals that the outcomes of subsidy policies can bring benefit to consumers and add a degree of complication for CLSC members; government organizations need to inspect carefully among attributes, mainly product type, power of CLSC members, and investment efficiency for the manufacturer, before implementing any subsidy policies so that it can lead to an environmentally and economically viable outcome.},

ABSTRACT = {In recent decades Global Positioning Systems (GPS) have become a ubiquitous tool to support navigation. Traditional GPS has an error in the order of 10–15 m, which is adequate for many applications (e.g., vehicle navigation) but for many robotics applications lacks required accuracy. In this paper we describe a technique, FAGPS (Fiducial Augmented Global Positioning System) to periodically use fiducial markers to lower the GPS drift, and hence for a small time-period have a more accurate GPS determination. We describe results from simulations and from field testing in open-sky environments where horizontal GPS accuracy was improved from a twice the distance root mean square (2DRMS) error of 5.5 m to 2.99 m for a period of up-to 30 min.},

ABSTRACT = {In this research paper, investigations of counter flow (opposing) jet on the aerodynamic performance, and flight stability characteristics of an airfoil with blunt leading-edge in supersonic regime are performed. Unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes ( U R A N S ) based solver is used to model the flow field. The effect of angle of attack ( α ), free-stream Mach number ( M ∞ ), and pressure ratio ( P R ) on aerodynamic performance of airfoil with and without jet are compared. The results indicate that the opposing jet reduces drag from 30 % to 70 % , improves the maximum lift-to-drag ratio from 2.5 to 4.0, and increases shock stand-off distance from 15 % to 35 % depending on flow conditions. The effect of opposing jet on longitudinal flight stability characteristics, studied for the first time, indicate improvement in dynamic stability coefficients ( C m q + C m α ˙ ) at low angles of attack. It is concluded that the opposing jet can help mitigate flight disturbances in supersonic regime.},

ABSTRACT = {Background: The efficiency and safety of primary open-angle glaucoma with high-frequency deep sclerotomy (HFDS) combined with cataract surgery has to be investigated. Methods: Right after cataract surgery, HFDS was performed ab interno in 205 consecutive patients with open angle glaucoma. HFDS was performed with a custom-made high-frequency disSection 19 G probe (abee tip 0.3 × 1 mm, Oertli Switzerland). The bipolar current with a frequency of 500 kHz is applied. The nasal sclera was penetrated repetitively six times through the trabecular meshwork and consecutively through Schlemm’s canal. Every time, a pocket of 0.3 mm high and 0.6 mm width was created. Results: Mean preoperative intraocular pressure (IOP) was 24.5 ± 2.1 mmHg (range 21 to 48 mmHg). After 48 months, the follow up average IOP was 15.0 ± 1.7 mmHg (range 10 to 20 mmHg). Postoperative IOP has been significantly reduced compared to preoperative IOP for all studied cases (p < 0.001). After 48 months, the target IOP less than 21 mmHg reached in 84.9%. No serious complications were observed during the surgical procedure itself and in the postoperative period. Conclusions: HFDS is a minimally invasive procedure. It is a safe and efficacious surgical technique for lowering IOP combined with cataract surgery.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, a new method is presented for sensitive quench detection in high-temperature superconductor (HTS) rotating machinery. The normal zone propagation velocity of an HTS is about 1000 times slower than that of a low-temperature superconductor. Therefore, the propagation of normal zone resistance, which occurs when the HTS transits from the superconducting state to the normal state, is also slower. Thus, it is difficult to detect the abnormal signals by voltage measurement using voltage taps. Moreover, the monitoring signal includes noise generated by interaction between the HTS rotating machinery and the industrial environment. Therefore, when quenching occurs in the HTS rotating machinery, a thermal runaway occurs in the hot spot. Furthermore, the magnetic energy stored in the HTS coil can damage the machinery. For these reasons, a new method is proposed for sensitive quench detection that reduces the noise generated from the power supply and from the HTS rotating machinery, using both an RLC resonance circuit and fast Fourier transform analysis.},

ABSTRACT = {Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) additive manufacturing technology is widely applied in recent years. However, there are many defects that may affect the surface quality, accuracy, or even cause the collapse of the parts in the printing process. In the existing defect detection technology, the characteristics of parts themselves may be misjudged as defects. This paper presents a solution to the problem of distinguishing the defects and their own characteristics in robot 3-D printing. A self-feature extraction method of shape defect detection of 3D printing products is introduced. Discrete point cloud after model slicing is used both for path planning in 3D printing and self-feature extraction at the same time. In 3-D printing, it can generate G-code and control the shooting direction of the camera. Once the current coordinates have been received, the self-feature extraction begins, whose key steps are keeping a visual point cloud of the printed part and projecting the feature points to the picture under the equal mapping condition. After image processing technology, the contours of pictured projected and picture captured will be detected. At last, the final defects can be identified after evaluation of contour similarity based on empirical formula. This work will help to detect the defects online, improve the detection accuracy, and reduce the false detection rate without being affected by its own characteristics.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper presents a new metamodel approach based on nonstationary kriging and a support vector machine to efficiently predict the stochastic eigenvalue of brake systems. One of the difficulties in the mode-coupling instability induced by friction is that stochastic eigenvalues represent heterogeneous behavior due to the bifurcation phenomenon. Therefore, the stationarity assumption in kriging, where the response is correlated over the entire random input space, may not remain valid. In this paper, to address this issue, Gibb’s nonstationary kernel with step-wise hyperparameters was adopted to reflect the heterogeneity of the stochastic eigenvalues. In predicting the response for unsampled input, the support vector machine-based classification is utilized. To validate the performance, a simplified finite element model of the brake system is considered. Under various types of uncertainties, including different friction coefficients and material properties, stochastic eigenvalue problems are investigated. Through numerical studies, it is seen that the proposed method improves accuracy and robustness compared to conventional stationary kriging.},

ABSTRACT = {Increasing customer requirements for quality and productivity in extruding aluminum products has led to the development of different types of extrusion dies. In this study, three different types of dies, including traditional flat die, pocket die and spread die were designed to extrude complex and large-scale solid profiles. The design parameters for these dies were used from actual extrusion experience. The results obtained from steady-state simulation such as velocity, temperature, extrusion force, and die deformation were used to assess the advantages and disadvantages of the dies. Transient simulations were performed to analyze the evolution of transverse weld in the pocket and spread dies. The effects of ram speeds on the related extrusion parameters were also investigated. The research results provide useful guides for designers and engineers in selecting these types of extrusion dies.},

ABSTRACT = {Life care for disabled or semi-disabled elderly has become an increasingly common problem in society. In this paper, a novel wheelchair-stretcher assistive robot, which can meet the physiological needs of patients, is investigated and designed. The following tasks are conducted: (1) the mecanum wheel is adopted as the executive device of the walking mechanism, and its kinematics is analyzed in detail. (2) A five-link mechanism with single degree of freedom is proposed to realize the folding motion of the robot. Through the minimum conclusive area method, the optimal sizes of the armrests link and the side link are 507.9, and 332.5 mm, respectively. Based on the force analysis of the linkage mechanism, six torsion springs and RV (rotate vector) reduction motor are used as the driving device, which reduces the driving torque of the motor. (3) Based on the STM32 (STMicroelectronics 32-bits Microcontroller) chip, and combined with the theoretical analysis, the mechanical structure and the control system of the whole prototype are designed, and the feasibility of each module is verified by experimental research. The results confirm that the proposed robot has good performance, and that the control algorithm for the walking mechanism and the lifting mechanism are suitable.},

ABSTRACT = {To satisfy increasing demands for ecofriendly vehicles, researchers are now studying electric vehicle (EV)-related technologies. In particular, integrated bidirectional onboard battery charger (OBC)/low-voltage DC–DC converter (LDC) modules are being researched to improve the efficiency of onboard chargers for EV charging applications. In this study, a numerical analysis method is proposed that considers the power loss and heat flow characteristics in the design of a 7.2 kW integrated bidirectional OBC/LDC module. The developed module supports four operating modes depending on the service situation: OBC and LDC single operation, OBC/LDC simultaneous operation, and LDC operation. The mode is selected based on the power system flow. The characteristics of the circuit were analyzed in each of the four modes to compute the heat loss from the major heating elements. The results of a numerical analysis of the internal cooling characteristics showed that the internal temperature was higher in the OBC single operating mode than in the OBC and LDC simultaneous operating mode in which the power loss was the highest. The results emphasize the importance of ensuring that cooling designs consider the characteristics of various modes as well as the worst-case power loss.},

ABSTRACT = {As regulations on the emission of pollutants from combustion systems are further tightened, it is necessary to reduce pollutant species and improve combustion efficiency to completely understand the process in the combustion field. Tunable diode laser absorption tomography (TDLAT) is a powerful tool that can analyze two-dimensional (2D) temperature and species concentration with fast-response and non-contact. In this study, stabilized spectra were implemented using the mean periodic signal technique to enable real-time 2D temperature measurement in harsh conditions. A time series statistical-based verification algorithm was introduced to select an optimal spectral cycle to track 2D reconstruction temperature. The statistical-based verification is based on the Two-sample t test, root mean square error, and time-based Mahalanobis distance, which is a technique for similarity analysis between thermocouple and reconstruction temperature of 18 candidate cycles. As a result, it was observed that the statistical-based TDLAT contribute to improving the accuracy of time series-based 2D temperature measurements.},

ABSTRACT = {The paper presents results obtained by experimental and numerical research focusing on the influence of the strikers’ geometry at the images of the destruction created in hybrid composite panels after applying impact load. In the research, the authors used four strikers with different geometry. The geometries were designed to keep the same weight for each of them. The composite panels used in the experiment were reinforced with aramid and carbon fabrics. An epoxy resin was used as a matrix. The experiments were carried with an impact kinetic energy of 23.5 J. The performed microscopy tests allowed for determination of destruction mechanisms of the panels depending on the geometry of the striker. The numerical calculations were performed using the finite element method. Each reinforcement layer of the composite was modeled as a different part. The bonded connection between the reinforcement layers was modeled using bilateral constraints. That approach enabled engineers to observe the delamination process during the impact. The results obtained from experimental and numerical investigations were compared. The authors present the impact of the striker geometry on damage formed in a composite panel. Formed damage was discussed. On the basis of the results from numerical research, energy absorption of the composite during impact depending on the striker geometry was discussed. It was noted that the size of the delamination area depends on the striker geometry. It was also noted that the diameter of the delamination area is related to the amount of damage in the reinforcing layers.},

ABSTRACT = {In recent years, soft modular robots have become popular among researchers with the development of soft robotics. However, the absence of a visual 3D simulation platform for soft modular robots hold back the development of the field. The three-dimensional simulation platform plays an important role in the field of multi-body robots. It can shorten the design cycle, reduce costs, and verify the effectiveness of the optimization algorithm expediently. Equally importantly, evolutionary computation is a very effective method for designing the controller of multi-body robots and soft robots with hyper redundancy and large parametric design space. In this paper, a tradeoff between the structural complexity of the soft modular robot and computational power of the simulation software is made. A reconfigurable soft modular robot is designed, and the open-source simulation software VOXCAD is re-developed to simulate the actual soft robot. The evolutionary algorithm is also applied to search for the most efficient motion pattern for an established configuration in VOXCAD, and experiments are conducted to validate the results.},

ABSTRACT = {Analyses were developed using a finite element method of the experimental measurement system for thermal conductivity of solid materials, used by the Centro Nacional de Metrología (CENAM), which operates under a condition of permanent heat flow. The CENAM implemented a thermal conductivity measurement system for solid materials limited in its operating intervals to measurements of maximum 300 ° C for solid conductive materials. However, the development of new materials should be characterised and studied to know their thermophysical properties and ensure their applications to any temperature conditions. These task demand improvements in the measurement system, which are proposed in the present work. Improvements are sought to achieve high-temperature measurements in metallic materials and conductive solids, and this system may also cover not only metallic materials. Simulations were performed to compare the distribution of temperatures developed in the measurement system as well as the radial heat leaks, which affect the measurement parameters for an aluminium bar, and uses copper bars as reference material. The simulations were made for measurements of an aluminium bar at a temperature of 150 ° C, in the plane and 3D, another at 175 ° C and one more known maximum temperature reached by a sample of the aluminium bar with a new heater acquired at 310 ° C.},

The method addresses the path planning problem that a number of cells undergo dynamic changes over time under work environment of cleaning robots. With simulations and experiments performed, it is discovered that the average relative error is 2.2% between the re-entry path planning and the best path, which validates the effectiveness and feasibility of the method.},

ABSTRACT = {Statistical process control (SPC) is an important tool of enterprise quality management. It can scientifically distinguish the abnormal fluctuations of product quality. Therefore, intelligent and efficient SPC is of great significance to the manufacturing industry, especially in the context of industry 4.0. The intelligence of SPC is embodied in the realization of histogram pattern recognition (HPR) and control chart pattern recognition (CCPR). In view of the lack of HPR research and the complexity and low efficiency of the manual feature of control chart pattern, an intelligent SPC method based on feature learning is proposed. This method uses multilayer bidirectional long short-term memory network (Bi-LSTM) to learn the best features from the raw data, and it is universal to HPR and CCPR. Firstly, the training and test data sets are generated by Monte Carlo simulation algorithm. There are seven histogram patterns (HPs) and nine control chart patterns (CCPs). Then, the network structure parameters and training parameters are optimized to obtain the best training effect. Finally, the proposed method is compared with traditional methods and other deep learning methods. The results show that the quality of extracted features by multilayer Bi-LSTM is the highest. It has obvious advantages over other methods in recognition accuracy, despite the HPR or CCPR. In addition, the abnormal patterns of data in actual production can be effectively identified.},

ABSTRACT = {Our study investigated the characteristics of the biomechanics of lower extremities during running single leg jump (RSJ) in collegiate basketball players. Twelve division III male basketball players voluntarily participated in this study. They performed three trials of the running single leg jump with two approach speeds (fast and preferred) randomly. The kinematic data were collected by motion analysis system (200 Hz), and kinetic data were collected using the AMTI force platform (1000 Hz), and electromyography (EMG) data were recorded by the Delsys surface Electromyography (EMG) system (2000 Hz). Kinematic, kinetic and EMG signal were synchronized using EvaRT 4.6. Peak Ground reaction force, eccentric loading rate (ELR), gastrocnemius (GA) of pre-activation phase, and tibialis anterior (TA) of push-off phase were found significantly larger in the fast approach speed (p < 0.05). RSJ improves muscle activation level and stretch reflex. Higher activation of TA and GA during RSJ may have the benefit of decreasing risk of injury and jump training. Thus, it is helpful in muscle stretch adaptation.},

The possibility to adopt this technology in early product/service design is going to bring positive effects such as the reduction of costs associated with the production of physical prototypes and the generation of a more effective knowledge of users’ feedback. This study proposes a preliminary methodology to evaluate users’ engagement in interacting with a virtual environment that consists of the integration between a self-report method (the user engagement scale questionnaire) and a method based on facial expression recognition. Results reported in this paper show that the two methodologies generate different types of knowledge which can be used to fit users’ needs and expectations. Even if focused on a specific case study, i.e., the evaluation of the engagement in a virtual learning environment, this paper aims to propose a methodology that can be applied to all kinds of virtual products.},

ABSTRACT = {A numerical study of the fire whirl formation under symmetrical and asymmetrical entraining configuration is presented. This work aims to assess the effect of eddy-generation configuration on the evolution of the intriguing phenomenon coupled with both flow dynamics and combustion. The numerical framework implements large-eddy simulation, detailed chemistry to capture the sophisticated turbulence-chemistry interaction under reasonable computational cost. It also adopts liquid-based clean fuel with fixed injection rate and uniformed discretisation scheme to eliminate potential interference introduced by various aspects of uncertainties. The result reveals that the nascent fire whirl formulates significantly rapidly under the symmetrical two-slit configuration, with extended flame height and constrained vortex structure, compared with the asymmetrical baseline. However, its revolution orbit gradually diverges from domain centreline and eventually stabilises with a large radius of rotation, whereas the revolution pattern of that from the baseline case is relatively unchanged from the inception of nascent fire whirl. Through the analysis, the observed difference in evaluation pathway could be explained using the concept of circular motion with constant centripetal force. This methodology showcases its feasibility to reveal and visualise the fundamental insight and facilitate profound understanding of the flaming behaviour to benefit both research and industrial sectors.},

ABSTRACT = {Wire electrochemical machining (WECM) has great advantages and potential for fabricating parts with ruled surfaces made of difficult-to-machine materials. Characterized by a relatively short flow path, a pulsating radial electrolyte supply in WECM is proposed to improve the machining capability for thick workpieces. The tool is a tube electrode with a line of micro-holes on cylindrical surface. This paper introduces research into the processing of micro-holes in the tube electrode using a rotating helical electrode. The quantitative relationship among the feed rate, the applied voltage, and the diameter of the outlet holes was determined experimentally. A tube electrode with holes of varying diameters was fabricated by adjusting the applied voltage. Using it as a tool electrode, kerfs with a length of 10 mm and an averaged width of 0.903 mm were machined at a feed rate of 6 μm/s in a 30 mm-thick block, and there was no short circuit during processing. It was shown experimentally that using a tube electrode with holes of varying diameters as a tool electrode provides better process capacity for pulsating radial electrolyte supply in WECM.},

ABSTRACT = {The non-proportionally damped system is very common in practical engineering structures. The dynamic equations for these systems, in which the damping matrices are coupled, are very time consuming to solve. In this paper, a modal perturbation method is proposed, which only requires the first few lower real mode shapes of a corresponding undamped system to obtain the complex mode shapes of non-proportionally damped system. In this method, an equivalent proportionally damped system is constructed by taking the real mode shapes of a corresponding undamped system and then transforming the characteristic equation of state space into a set of nonlinear algebraic equations by using the vibration modes of an equivalent proportionally damped system. Two numerical examples are used to illustrate the validity and accuracy of the proposed modal perturbation method. The numerical results show that: (1) with the increase of vibration modes of the corresponding undamped system, the eigenvalues and eigenvectors monotonically converge to exact solutions; (2) the accuracy of the proposed method is significantly higher than the first-order perturbation method and proportional damping method. The calculation time of the proposed method is shorter than the state space method; (3) the method is particularly suitable for finding a few individual orders of frequency and mode of a system with highly non-proportional damping.},

ABSTRACT = {The effect of chromium content in the range of 1 wt.%–4 wt.% on the microstructure and mechanical properties of controlled-rolled and direct-quenched 12 mm thick low-carbon (0.04 wt.%) steel plates containing 0.06 wt.% Nb has been studied. In these microalloyed 700 MPa grade steels, the aim was to achieve a robust bainitic microstructure with a yield strength of 700 MPa combined with good tensile ductility and impact toughness. Continuous cooling transformation diagrams of deformed and non-deformed austenite were recorded to study the effect of Cr and hot deformation on the transformation behavior of the investigated steels. Depending on the cooling rate, the microstructures consist of one or more of the following microstructural constituents: bainitic ferrite, granular bainite, polygonal ferrite, and pearlite. The fraction of bainitic ferrite decreases with decreasing cooling rate, giving an increasing fraction of granular bainite and polygonal ferrite and a reduction in the hardness of the transformation products. Polygonal ferrite formation depends mainly on the Cr content and the cooling rate. In both deformed and non-deformed austenite, increasing the Cr content enhances the hardenability and refines the final microstructure, shifting the ferrite start curve to lower cooling rates. Preceding austenite deformation promotes the formation of polygonal ferrite at lower cooling rates, which leads to a decrease in hardness. In hot-rolled and direct-quenched plates, decreasing the Cr content promotes the formation of polygonal ferrite leading to an increase in the impact toughness and elongation but also a loss of yield strength.},

ABSTRACT = {With the decrease of oil and gas resources on land, increased attention has been paid to multiphase oil–gas exploitation and the transportation technology represented by oil–gas multiphase pumps. The helical–axial multiphase pump has become the focus of research on oil and gas mixed transmission technology due to its relatively high operating efficiency and adaptability to a wide range of gas volume fraction changes. In order to investigate the thickness variation in the air foil from the hub to the shroud of the blade on the mixture transportation characteristics of the gas–liquid two-phase flow in a helical–axial pump, the thickness ratio coefficient ξ was introduced, and the hydraulic performance of the single compression unit with different thickness ratio coefficients was investigated. A single compression unit including an impeller, diffuser, inlet section and outlet section of a helical–axial multiphase pump. The hydraulic performance including the hydraulic head and efficiency was investigated by numerical simulation with the Eulerian multiphase model and the shear stress transport (SST) k-w turbulence model. In order to demonstrate the validity of the numerical simulation approach, the hydraulic head and efficiency of the basic model was measured based on a gas–liquid two-phase flow pump performance test bench. The simulation results agreed well with the experimental results; the error between the simulation results and experimental results of different inlet gas volume fractions was within 10% at the design point, which indicated the numerical simulation method can be used in the research. The thickness ratio coefficient ξ, which was taken as a variable, and the aggregation degree λ of the gas were introduced to analyze the gas–liquid mixture transportation characteristics of the pump. The thickness ratio coefficient was selected in a range from 0.8 to 1.8. The results showed that, for the same hub thickness, the head coefficient and efficiency increase, and the aggregation degree of gas decreases with the decreasing of the thickness ratio coefficient. The head coefficient of the modification multiphase pump was 5.8% higher in comparison to the base pump while the efficiency was 3.1% higher than that of the base pump, the aggregation degree of this model was the lowest, which was 30.3%; the optimal model in the research was the model of scheme 1 with ξ = 0.8. The accumulation of gas in the flow passage of the impeller could be delayed to the trailing edge of the blade by adjusting the thickness ratio coefficient, which produced a super-separated airfoil for helical–axial multiphase pumps and effectively ensured reliable operation under high gas volume fraction conditions. The accumulation area of gas was consistent with the area in which the gradient of turbulent kinetic energy was large.},

ABSTRACT = {For a non-contact, non-destructive quality evaluation, laser ultrasonic testing (LUT) has received increasing attention in complex manufacturing processes, such as additive manufacturing (AM). This work assessed the LUT method for the inspection of internal hole defects in additive manufactured Ti-6Al-4V part. A Q-switched pulsed laser was utilized to generate ultrasound waves on the top surface of a Ti-6Al-4V alloy part, and a laser Doppler vibrometer (LDV) was utilized to detect the ultrasound waves. Sub-millimeter (0.8 mm diameter) internal hole defect was successfully detected by using the established LUT system in pulse-echo mode. The method achieved a relatively high resolution, suggesting significant application prospects in the non-destructive evaluation of AM part. The relationship between the diameter of the hole defects and the amplitude of the laser-generated Rayleigh waves was studied. X-ray computed tomography (XCT) was conducted to validate the results obtained from the LUT system.},

ABSTRACT = {Machinery diagnostics and prognostics usually involve the prediction process of fault-types and remaining useful life (RUL) of a machine, respectively. The process of developing a data-driven diagnostics and prognostics method involves some fundamental subtasks such as data rebalancing, feature extraction, dimension reduction, and machine learning. In general, the best performing algorithm and the optimal hyper-parameters suitable for each subtask are varied across the characteristics of datasets. Therefore, it is challenging to develop a general diagnostic/prognostic framework that can automatically identify the best subtask algorithms and the optimal involved parameters for a given dataset. To resolve this problem, we propose a new framework based on an ensemble of genetic algorithms (GAs) that can be used for both the fault-type classification and RUL prediction. Our GA is combined with a specific machine-learning method and then tries to select the best algorithm and optimize the involved parameter values in each subtask. In addition, our method constructs an ensemble of various prediction models found by the GAs. Our method was compared to a traditional grid-search over three benchmark datasets of the fault-type classification and the RUL prediction problems and showed a significantly better performance than the latter. Taken together, our framework can be an effective approach for the fault-type and RUL prediction of various machinery systems.},

ABSTRACT = {For a rolling bearing fault that has nonlinearity and nonstationary characteristics, it is difficult to identify the fault category. A rolling bearing clustering fault diagnosis method based on ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD), permutation entropy (PE), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and the Gath–Geva (GG) clustering algorithm is proposed. Firstly, we decompose the vibration signal using EEMD, and several inherent modal components are obtained. Then, the permutation entropy values of each modal component are calculated to get the entropy feature vector, and the entropy feature vector is reduced by the LDA method to be used as the input of the clustering algorithm. The data experiments show that the proposed fault diagnosis method can obtain satisfactory clustering indicators. It implies that compared with other mode combination methods, the fault identification method proposed in this study has the advantage of better intra-class compactness of clustering results.},

ABSTRACT = {Purpose: This study aims to investigate the acute effects of shoe midsole stiffness on the joint biomechanics of the lower extremities during specific basketball movements. Methods: Thirty participants wearing stiff midsole shoes (SS) and control shoes (CS) performed layup jumps (LJs) while the kinematics and ground reaction forces were simultaneously collected via the Vicon motion capture system and Kistler force plates. Furthermore, the joint angles, range of motion (ROM), joint power, joint energy, and jump height were calculated. Results: No significant differences were observed between SS and CS conditions for both jump height and the metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint biomechanics except that the minimum angular velocity of the MTP joint was significantly lower in SS the condition. However, the ROM in the ankle joint was significantly greater in the SS condition than in the CS condition (p < 0.05). Additionally, the maximum plantarflexion power, energy absorption (EA), and energy generation (EG) in the ankle joint were significantly greater in the SS condition than in the CS condition (p < 0.05). Compared with the CS condition, jump height in the SS condition did not increase. Conclusion: During a single LJ, the longitudinal midsole stiffness did not influence the jump height and MTP joint biomechanical patterns but significantly increased the maximum power, EA, and EG during the push-off phase of the ankle joint. These preliminary results indicate that wearing SS could change the ankle joint mechanical patterns by modulating the lower extremity kinetic chain, and may enhance muscle strength in the ankle.},

ABSTRACT = {A single-function product cannot meet various needs of different users when the product user or use environment changes. A transformable product with multiple functions can meet different needs of users. It is critical to determine product functions that a transformable product should have in the product design. However, it is a challenge to decide required functional components of a transformable product in the design process. A clustering method is proposed in this paper using undirected graphs for segmentations of needs in the time dimension. A need-based function model is built to form product function chains based on cost of the function transition distance between different function chains. Undirected graphs of the function chains are constructed according to the similarity of product functions. The interrelated subgraphs are then used to form multiple functions of a transformable product based on segmentations. A wheelchair is developed as an example to verify the proposed method. The method improves the design process of transformable products accurately and effectively.},

ABSTRACT = {By combining the flapping and rotary motion, a bio-inspired flapping wing rotor (FWR) is a unique kinematics of motion. It can produce a significantly greater aerodynamic lift and efficiency than mimicking the insect wings in a vertical take-off and landing (VTOL). To produce the same lift, the FWR’s flapping frequency, twist angle, and self-propelling rotational speed is significantly smaller than the insect-like flapping wings and rotors. Like its opponents, however, the effect of variant flapping frequency (VFF) of a FWR, during a flapping cycle on its aerodynamic characteristics and efficiency, remains to be evaluated. A FWR model is built to carry out experimental work. To be able to vary the flapping frequency rapidly during a stroke, an ultrasonic motor (USM) is used to drive the FWR. Experiment and numerical simulation using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) are performed in a VFF range versus the usual constant flapping frequency (CFF) cases. The measured lifting forces agree very well with the CFD results. Flapping frequency in an up-stroke is smaller than a down-stroke, and the negative lift and inertia forces can be reduced significantly. The average lift of the FWR where the motion in VFF is greater than the CFF, in the same input motor power or equivalent flapping frequency. In other words, the required power for a VFF case to produce a specified lift is less than a CFF case. For this FWR model, the optimal installation angle of the wings for high lift and efficiency is found to be 30° and the Strouhal number of the VFF cases is between 0.3–0.36.},

ABSTRACT = {In this work, we present a complete hybrid navigation system for a two-wheel differential drive mobile robot that includes static-environment- global-path planning and dynamic environment obstacle-avoidance tasks. By the given map, we propose a multi-agent A-heuristic algorithm for finding the optimal obstacle-free path. The result is less time-consuming and involves fewer changes in path length when dealing with multiple agents than the ordinary A-heuristic algorithm. The obtained path was smoothed based on curvature-continuous piecewise cubic Bézier curve (C2 PCBC) before being used as a trajectory by the robot. In the second task of the robot, we supposed any unforeseen obstacles were recognized and their moving frames were estimated by the sensors when the robot tracked on the trajectory. In order to adapt to the dynamic environment with the presence of constant velocity obstacles, a weighted-sum model (WSM) was employed. The 2D LiDAR data, the robot’s frame and the detected moving obstacle’s frame were collected and fed to the WSM during the movement of the robot. Through this information, the WSM chose a temporary target and a C2 PCBC-based subtrajectory was generated that led the robot to avoid the presented obstacle. Experimentally, the proposed model responded well in existing feasible solution cases with fine-tuned model parameters. We further provide the re-path algorithm that helped the robot track on the initial trajectory. The experimental results show the real-time performance of the system applied in our robot.},

The methodology is based on the Maxwell viscoelastic element, with stress relaxation taken into account by the Prony series’ representation of the bulk and shear material moduli. Simultaneous solutions for deviatoric and volumetric stresses were obtained under instantaneous elastic and subsequent viscoelastic relaxation, at multiples of the relaxation time of a Highly Filled Carbon Polymer (HFCP) layer. The results of the analysis were validated by a constructed, multi-layered sandwich sensor comprising the HFCP sensing elements covered by a protective silicone rubber surface of very low elastic modulus. The combined numerical-experimental approach, and the validated viscoelastic layered contact mechanics represent the original contribution of this paper, not hitherto reported in literature.},

ABSTRACT = {Linear vibration motors are becoming more popular for use in haptic applications owing to their better performance. However, a permanent magnet with a large volume causes massive magnetic flux leakage, which can be harmful to passengers with a cardiac pacemaker or an implantable-cardioverter defibrillator. The magnetic flux leakage is calculated using the 3D finite element method, which can also be applied to obtain the force factor. Then, the displacement and impedance are obtained to check the performance of the linear vibration motor by utilizing the finite element method. A prototype of a linear vibration motor is analyzed and verified based on the experimental results. Based on the analysis methods, three new designs are proposed to reduce the magnetic flux leakage to within 50 G. The final design shows a 93.07% reduction of the magnetic flux leakage while maintaining the same performance as the prototype. To verify the validity of the analysis results, three experimental results were obtained: the magnetic flux leakage, displacement, and impedance. The experimental results are in good agreement with the analysis results.},

ABSTRACT = {The objective of the study was to evaluate the clinical, functional, and biomechanical symptoms in patients with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture before and after ACL reconstruction. The study enrolled 20 patients and 20 healthy subjects as controls. Walking biomechanics was assessed at three time points: before surgery and three months and a year or more after surgical reconstruction. Impact loads on both sides differed significantly from the respective values before surgery (p<0.05). Walking cycle duration decreased with time after surgery. On both sides (affected and unaffected), hip movement amplitudes were significantly smaller than in control (p<0.05). They remained so in the follow-up periods after the reconstruction. Before ACL reconstruction, the amplitude of the main flexion of the knee was significantly reduced both on the affected and unaffected sides. The amplitude gradually increased after the reconstruction, and a year post-surgery, it reached, on the operated side, the same values as in the control group. Complete functional recovery of the knee joint was not achieved within a year after the ACL surgical reconstruction. The remaining changes, however, were not clinically pronounced and could only be detected by instrumental gait analysis. The compensatory processes developed bilaterally, in both the hip and knee joints.},

ABSTRACT = {Effective and reliable interconnections are crucial for microfluidics to connect with the macro world. Current microfluidic interfaces are still bulky, expensive, or with issues of clogging and material limitation. In this study, a novel ultraviolet (UV)-assisted coaxial three-dimensional (3D) printing approach was proposed to fabricate hollow microfluidic connectors with advantages of rapid prototyping, fixture-free, and materials compatible. An assembled coaxial nozzle was designed to enable co-flow extrusion, where the inner flow (water) served as the sacrificial layer and the outer flow (adhesive) was cured for shell formation. Furthermore, a converged UV-LED light source was attached to the coaxial nozzle for UV curing of adhesives. UV rheological characterizations were performed to study the UV curing kinematics, and the gelation time was employed to describe the state transition behaviors of UV curable adhesives used in the study. To explore requirements for successful hollow connectors direct printing, processing criteria such as co-flow regime and pre-cure time were investigated. The hollow connectors with an inner channel diameter of ~150 μ m and a height of 5 mm were successfully printed on polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) and glass substrate. The integration feasibility of the proposed method was also demonstrated by the presented microfluidic device with printed hollow connectors.},

ABSTRACT = {An adaptive target tracking method based on extended Kalman filter (TT-EKF) is proposed to simultaneously estimate the state of an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) and an mobile recovery system (MRS) with unknown non-Gaussian process noise in homing process. In the application scenario of this article, the process noise includes the measurement noise of AUV heading and forward speed and the estimation error of MRS heading and forward speed. The accuracy of process noise covariance matrix (PNCM) can affect the state estimation performance of the TT-EKF. The variational Bayesian based algorithm is applied to estimate the process noise statistics. We use a Gaussian mixture distribution to model the non-Gaussian noisy forward speed of AUV and MRS. We use a von-Mises distribution to model the noisy heading of AUV and MRS. The variational Bayesian algorithm is applied to estimate the parameters of these distributions, and then the PNCM can be calculated. The prediction error of TT-EKF is online compensated by using a multilayer neural network, and the neural network is online trained during the target tracking process. Matlab simulation and experimental data analysis results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

ABSTRACT = {Due to the layer-by-layer nature of the process, parts produced by laser-based powder bed fusion (LPBF) have high residual stresses, causing excessive deformations. To avoid this, parts are often post-processed by subjecting them to specially designed heat treatment cycles before or after their removal from the base plate. In order to investigate the effects of the choice of post-processing steps, in this work the entire LPBF process chain is modelled in a commercial software package. The developed model illustrates the possibilities of implementing and tailoring the process chain model for metal additive manufacturing using a general purpose finite element (FE) solver. The provided simplified computational example presents an idealised model to analyse the validity of implementing the LPBF process chain in FE software. The model is used to evaluate the effect of the order of the process chain, the heat treatment temperature and the duration of the heat treatment. The results show that the model is capable of qualitatively capturing the effect of the stress relaxation that occurs during a heat treatment at elevated temperature. Due to its implementation, the model is relatively insensitive to duration and heat treatment temperature, at least as long as it is above the relaxation temperature. Furthermore, the simulations suggest that, when post-processing, it is necessary to perform the stress relaxation before the part is removed from the base plate, in order to avoid a significant increase of the deformation. The paper demonstrates the capability of the simulation tool to evaluate the effects of variations in the process chain steps and highlights its potential usage in directing decision-making for LPBF process chain design.},

ABSTRACT = {A thermal-induced measurement error induced by thermal deformation of digital camera in photo mechanics methods that has the same magnitude of the error as that in the resistance strain measurement method reduces the accuracy of high-precision measurement substantially and must, therefore, be compensated. Starting from the underlying mechanism of a thermal-induced measurement error, we investigated the image error introduced by thermal behaviours of digital cameras widely used in photo mechanics. We experimentally determined the relationships between the thermal behaviours and temperature, derived the relationship between the image error and measurement error of photo mechanics methods, and eventually established a physical model to explain the underlying relationship between the thermal-induced measurement error and temperature. Furthermore, based on the investigation of the underlying mechanism, we introduced three types of temperature compensation methods for photo mechanics, namely the model compensation method, the preheating method, and the compensation specimen method. We experimentally demonstrated the feasibility of these compensation methods. The model compensation method only needs the data regarding the environmental temperature during operation of the digital camera to implement the correction of the measurement results and enhance the measurement accuracy of photo mechanics methods. The preheating method is suitable for indoor photo mechanics measurements wherein the environmental temperature is almost constant, which ensures that the appearance of thermal balance of the digital camera after a period of self-heating. The compensation specimen method reduces the effective resolution of the images and it also requires that the image error forms in the region of tested specimen are the same as that in the region of the compensation specimen.},

ABSTRACT = {The conventional frequency domain method (CFDM) and dual-force-based time domain method (DTDM) are often used to solve the steady-state response of system with complex damping under an arbitrary force. However, the calculation efficiency of the DTDM is low due to the straightforward summation operation of series even if the solution of the DTDM is the exact real part of the solution. In addition, since the CFDM only can obtain the real part of solution not the complete solution, it gives misleading information that the solution does not have an imaginary part. In this paper, a fast frequency domain method (FFDM) is proposed to calculate the complete response of complex damping system including the imaginary part with a higher accuracy in a much faster manner. The new FFDM uses half of the Fourier series of the discrete Fourier transform of the actual arbitrary force to construct the Fourier series of the dual force, followed by calculating the time history response using the inverse fast Fourier transform. The new developed method is validated through three numerical examples with harmonic and seismic excitations. The numerical results show that the accuracy of the new FFDM is compatible to the DTDM but with much higher computational efficiency.},

ABSTRACT = {An optimal control design for the uncertain Delta robot is proposed in the paper. The uncertain factors of the Delta robot include the unknown dynamic parameters, the residual vibration disturbances and the nonlinear joints friction, which are (possibly fast) time-varying and bounded. A fuzzy set theoretic approach is creatively used to describe the system uncertainty. With the fuzzily depicted uncertainty, an adaptive robust control, based on the fuzzy dynamic model, is established. It designs an adaptation mechanism, consisting of the leakage term and the dead-zone, to estimate the uncertainty information. An optimal design is constructed for the Delta robot and solved by minimizing a fuzzy set-based performance index. Unlike the traditional fuzzy control methods (if-then rules-based), the proposed control scheme is deterministic and fuzzily optimized. It is proven that the global solution in the closed form for this optimal design always exists and is unique. This research provides the Delta parallel robot a novel optimal control to guarantee the system performance regardless of the uncertainty. The effectiveness of the proposed control is illustrated by a series of simulation experiments. The results reveal that the further applications in other robots are feasible.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, we show that the hard computing approach using the p-median problem (PMP) is a very effective strategy for optimally solving large-size generalized cell formation (GCF) problems. The soft computing approach, relying on heuristic or metaheuristic search algorithms, has been the prevailing strategy for solving large-size GCF problems with a short computation time at the cost of the global optimum in large instances of GCF problems; however, due to recent advances in computing technology, using hard computing techniques to solve large-sized GCF problems optimally is not time-prohibitive if an appropriate mathematical model is built. We show that the hard computing approach using the PMP-type model can even solve large 0–1 GCF instances optimally in a very short computation time with a powerful mixed integer linear programming (MILP) solver adopting an exact search algorithm such as the branch-and-bound algorithm.},

ABSTRACT = {The mechanical behaviour of an agricultural tyre is a matter of extreme interest as it is related to the comfort of operators, to the adherence of agricultural machines, and to the compaction of agricultural soil. Moreover, the deformability of the tyres plays a fundamental role in vehicle stability in terms of side rollover. The behaviour of a loaded tyre during its deformation is complex, due to the combined contributions of the carcass components, the tread rubber and the air contained within it. Therefore, this study proposes an experimental–numerical approach for the mechanical characterization of agricultural tyres based on real-scale experiments and matches these results with a finite-element (FE) model. The tyre flattening in the elastic field has been described using two coefficients (Young’s modulus “E”, Poisson’s ratio “ν”), whose values have been identified with an iterative FEM procedure. The proposed approach was applied to two different tyres (420/85 R24 and 460/85 R34), each one inflated at two different pressures (1.0 bar and 1.6 bar). Young’s modulus was appreciated to be highly variable with the inflation pressure “p” of the tyres. Furthermore, the response surface methodology was applied to find two mathematical regression models, useful for studying the variations of the tyre footprint dimensions according to the type of tyre. This simple approach can be applied in other simulations without suffering any loss of accuracy in the description of the phenomenon.},

ABSTRACT = {Workload control mechanisms are widely studied in the literature for the control of job-shop systems. The control of these systems involves acceptance, order release and priority dispatching. At the release level, the workload norm controls the “enters” of the jobs; it is relevant how the aggregate workload is computed. Few works have studied new computation methods of the aggregate workload but use the adjusted aggregate workload proposed in the literature. This paper proposes a dynamically adjusted aggregate workload to improve the performance of the workload control mechanism in job-shop systems. The adjusted aggregate workload is updated when each part exits from a workstation; this means that the workload used to release the orders is related to the state of the job shop in real-time. Simulation is used to evaluate and compare the proposed model to the classical models proposed in the literature. The simulation experiments demonstrate improvement of performance and how the model proposed is robust under different manufacturing system conditions.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper aims to propose a strategy for the flight control of quad-rotors under single rotor failure conditions. The proposed control strategy consists of two stages—fault detection (FD) and fault tolerant control (FTC). A dual observer-based strategy for FD and fault estimation is developed. With the combination of the results from both observers, the decision making in whether a fault actually happened or the observed anomaly was caused by an external disturbance could be distinguished. Following the FD result, a control strategy for normal flight, as well as the abnormal one, is presented. The FTC considers a real-time coordinate transformation scheme to manipulate the target angles for the quad-rotor to follow a prescribed trajectory. When a rotor fault happens, it is going to be detected by the dual observers and then the FTC is activated to stabilize the system such that the trajectory following task can still be fulfilled. Furthermore, in order to achieve robust flight in the presence of external wind perturbation, the sliding mode control (SMC) theory is further integrated. Simulations illustrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed method.},

ABSTRACT = {The paper presents the modeling and control design of a floating piston electro-pneumatic gearbox actuator and, moreover, the industrial validation of the controller system. As part of a heavy-duty vehicle, it needs to meet strict and contradictory requirements and units applying the system with different supply pressures in order to operate under various environmental conditions. Because of the high control frequency domain of the real system, post-modern control methods with high computational demands could not be used as they do not meet real-time requirements on automotive level. During the modeling phase, the essential simplifications are shown with the awareness of the trade-off between calculation speed and numerical accuracy to generate a multi-state piecewise-linear system. Two LTI control methods are introduced, i.e., a PD and an Linear-Quadratic Regulators (LQR) solution, in which the continuous control signals are transformed into discrete voltage solenoid commands for the valves. The validation of both the model and the control system are performed on a real physical implementation. The results show that both modeling and control design are suitable for the control tasks using floating piston cylinders and, moreover, these methods can be extended to electro-pneumatic cylinders with different layouts.},

ABSTRACT = {This research aims to investigate the development of muscle fatigue and the recovery process revealed by tissue oxygenation. The tissue hemodynamics were measured by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) during a 30-min pre-exercise rest, a 40-cycle heel-lift exercise and a 30-min post-exercise recovery. Wavelet transform was used to obtain the normalized wavelet energy in six frequency intervals (I–VI) and inverse wavelet transform was applied to extract exercise-induced oscillations from the hemodynamic signals. During the exercise phase, the contraction-related oscillations in the total hemoglobin signal (ΔtHb) showed a decreasing trend while the fluctuations in the tissue oxygenation index (TOI) displayed an increasing tendency. The mean TOI value was significantly higher (p < 0.001) under recovery (65.04% ± 2.90%) than that under rest (62.35% ± 3.05%). The normalized wavelet energy of the ΔtHb signal in frequency intervals I (p < 0.001), II (p < 0.05), III (p < 0.05) and IV (p < 0.01) significantly increased by 43.4%, 23.6%, 18.4% and 21.6% during the recovery than that during the pre-exercise rest, while the value in interval VI (p < 0.05) significantly decreased by 16.6%. It could be concluded that NIRS-derived hemodynamic signals can provide valuable information related to muscle fatigue and recovery.},

ABSTRACT = {Glenohumeral stability is essential for a healthy function of the shoulder. It is ensured partly by the scapulohumeral muscular balance. Accordingly, modelling muscle interactions is a key factor in the understanding of occupational pathologies, and the development of ergonomic interventions. While static optimization is commonly used to estimate muscle activations, it tends to underestimate the role of shoulder’s antagonist muscles. The purpose of this study was to implement experimental electromyographic (EMG) data to predict muscle activations that could account for the stabilizing role of the shoulder muscles. Kinematics and EMG were recorded from 36 participants while lifting a box from hip to eye level. Muscle activations and glenohumeral joint reactions were estimated using an EMG-assisted algorithm and compared to those obtained using static optimization with a generic and calibrated model. Muscle activations predicted with the EMG-assisted method were generally larger. Additionally, more interactions between the different rotator cuff muscles, as well as between primer actuators and stabilizers, were predicted with the EMG-assisted method. Finally, glenohumeral forces calculated from a calibrated model remained within the boundaries of the glenoid stability cone. These findings suggest that EMG-assisted methods could account for scapulohumeral muscle co-contraction, and thus their contribution to the glenohumeral stability.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper focuses on developing a pneumatic-driven and horizontal-structure linear delta robot (PH-LDR) and increasing its trajectory tracking performance on the three-degrees-of-freedom (3-DOF) space. With the investigation of inverse and forward kinematics, the parallel mechanism of PH-LDR is designed by using three high-power and low-cost rod-less pneumatic actuators (PAs) to track 3-DOF motion, and this has a horizontal structure to enlarge the workspace. Since the PH-LDR features nonlinear coupling among its three axes and is disturbed by the three high-nonlinear rod-less PAs, the tracking control performance is significantly decreased, subject to uncertain nonlinearity and parametric uncertainty. Therefore, a fuzzy-PID controller is used to achieve highly accurate 3-DOF trajectory tracking, and furthermore, this study exploits neural networks (NNs) to pre-compensate the impacts arising from the compressibility of air and temperature change. The control system for the PH-LDR also features an embedded controller that allows real-time control. Experimental demonstration verifies the developed PH-LDR with the proposed controller, and the dynamic tracking accuracy in 3-DOF trajectory can be achieved.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper presents the change of non-dimensional characteristics and thermal behavior of different sized tilting pad journal bearings (TPJBs) with the same Sommerfeld number. A three-dimensional (3D) TPJB numerical model is provided considering the thermo-elastic hydro-dynamic (TEHD) lubrication model with pad thermal-elastic deformation. The pivot stiffness is assumed to be the combination of linear and cubic stiffness based on the Hertzian contact theory. The TPJBs in a configuration of load between pad (LBP) with the same Sommerfeld number having seven different sizes are simulated, and their non-dimensional dynamic and static characteristics and thermal behavior are compared. Pad thermal and elastic deformation are both taken into account. If the changes in lubricant viscosity, thermal deformation, and elastic deformation of journal/pads due to viscous shearing are ignored, the bearings with identical Sommerfeld numbers should show the same performance characteristics. However, the heat generation at the bearing clearance during operation (a) induces a decrease in viscosity and heat transfer to journal/pads and (b) results in a thermal deformation. Furthermore, the elastic deformation of the tilting pads and pivots also affects the bearing dynamic performance. For the same Sommerfeld number, the numerical analyses provide how the viscous shearing and elastic deformation lead to a change in bearing performance. For the small bearings with the same Sommerfeld number, the non-dimensional characteristics did not change significantly, where the heat generation was small being compared to the large sized bearing. The largest change in non-dimensional characteristics occurred when the maximum temperature of the oil film increased by 30 °C or more compared to the lubricant supply temperature. The root cause of the change in the non-dimensional characteristics is the viscous shearing in the oil film, and the thermal deformation of the structures surrounding the oil film acts in combination. These results provide insight into the Sommerfeld number, which can be used for the early stage of bearing design.},

ABSTRACT = {The synchronization error of the left and right steering-wheel-angles and the disturbances rejection of the synchronization controller are of great significance for the active rear axle independent steering (ARIS) system under complex driving conditions and uncertain disturbances. In order to reduce synchronization error, a novel hierarchical synchronization control strategy based on virtual synchronization control and linear active disturbance rejection control (LADRC) is proposed. The upper controller adopts the virtual synchronization controller based on the dynamic model of the virtual rear axle steering mechanism to reduce the synchronization error between the rear wheel steering angles of the ARIS system; the lower controller is designed based on an LADRC algorithm to realize an accurate tracking control of the steering angle for each wheels. Experiments based on a prototype vehicle are conducted to prove that the proposed hierarchical synchronization control strategy for the ARIS system can improve the control accuracy significantly and has the properties of better disturbances rejection and stronger robustness.},

ABSTRACT = {In this study, the effect of oxygen in the shielding gas on the material flow behavior of the weld pool surface was discussed to clarify the dominant driving weld pool force in keyhole plasma arc welding (KPAW). To address this issue, the convection flow on the top surface of weld pool was observed using a high-speed video camera. The temperature distribution on the surface along keyhole wall was measured using the two-color pyrometry method to confirm the Marangoni force activity on the weld pool. The results show that the inclination angle of the keyhole wall (keyhole shape) increased especially near the top surface due to the decrease in the surface tension of weld pool through surface oxidation when a shielding gas of Ar + 0.5% O2 was used. Due to the change in the keyhole shape, the upward and backward shear force compositions created a large inclination angle at the top surface of the keyhole. From the temperature measurement results, the Marangoni force was found to alter the direction when 0.5% O2 was mixed with the shielding gas. The shear force was found to be the strongest force among the four driving forces. The buoyant force and Lorentz force were very weak. The Marangoni force was stronger than the Lorentz force but was weaker than shear force. The interaction of shear force and Marangoni force controlled the behavior and speed of material flow on the weld pool surface. A strong upward and backward flow was observed in the case of mixture shielding gas, whereas a weak upward flow was observed for pure Ar. The heat transportation due to the weld pool convection significantly changed when only a small amount of oxygen was admixed in the shielding gas. The results can be applied to control the penetration ratio in KPAW.},

ABSTRACT = {In rubber bumper design, the most important mechanical property of the product is the force–displacement curve under compression and its fulfillment requires an iterative design method. Design engineers can handle this task with the modification of the product shape, which can be solved with several optimization methods if the parameterization of the design process is determined. The numerical method is a good way to evaluate the working characteristics of the rubber product; furthermore, automation of the whole process is feasible with the use of Visual Basic for Application. An axisymmetric finite element model of a rubber bumper was built with the use of a calibrated two-term Mooney–Rivlin material model. A two-dimensional shape optimization problem was introduced where the objective function was determined as the difference between the initial and the optimum characteristics. Our goal was to integrate a surrogate model-based parameter selection of local search algorithms for the optimization process. As a metamodeling technique, cubic support vector regression was selected and seemed to be suitable to accurately predict the nonlinear objective function. The novel optimization procedure which applied the support vector regression model in the parameter selection process of the stochastic search algorithm proved to be an efficient method to find the global optimum of the investigated problem.},

ABSTRACT = {Rolling-element bearings (REBs) make up a class of non-linear rotating machines that can be applied in several activities. Conceding a bearing has complicated and uncertain behavior that exhibits substantial challenges to fault diagnosis. Thus, the offered anomaly-diagnosis algorithm, based on a fuzzy orthonormal-ARX adaptive fuzzy logic-structure feedback observer, is developed. A fuzzy orthonormal-ARX algorithm is presented for non-stationary signal modeling. Next, a robust, stable, reliable, and accurate observer is developed for signal estimation. Therefore, firstly, a classical feedback observer is implemented. To address the robustness drawback found in feedback observers, a multi-structure technique is developed. Furthermore, to generate signal estimation performance and reliability, the fuzzy logic technique is applied to the structure feedback observer. Also, to improve the stability, reliability, and robustness of the fuzzy orthonormal-ARX fuzzy logic-structure feedback observer, an adaptive algorithm is developed. After generating the residual signals, a support vector machine (SVM) is developed for the detection and classification of the bearing fault conditions. The effectiveness of the proposed procedure is validated using two different datasets for single-type fault diagnosis based on the Case Western Reverse University (CWRU) vibration dataset and multi-type fault diagnosis of bearing using the Smart Health Safety Environment (SHSE) Lab acoustic emission dataset. The proposed algorithm increases the classification accuracy from 86% in the SVM-based fuzzy orthonormal-ARX feedback observer to 97.5% in single-type fault and from 80% to 98.3% in the multi-type faults.},

ABSTRACT = {This study investigated how midsole hardness of basketball footwear affects lower extremity biomechanics and impacts perception in drop vertical jumps. Eighteen male basketball players performed drop vertical jumps from three heights (31 cm, 46 cm, 61 cm) in basketball shoes of different midsole hardness (50, 60 Asker C). Biomechanical variables of the lower extremity and subjective perception were measured. This study found a significant drop height effect on the lower extremity biomechanics (p < 0.05), with greater ground reaction forces, joint kinetics, and prelanding muscle activation levels observed at higher drop heights. Basketball shoes with a softer midsole led to higher forefoot peak force (p = 0.028) amid lower rearfoot peak force (p = 0.046), lower peak flexion moments at the ankle (p = 0.024) and hip joints (p = 0.029), and greater prelanding muscle activation in the rectus femoris (p = 0.042) and tibialis anterior (p = 0.043). It is concluded that changing midsole hardness within a commercially relevant range triggered a different prelanding muscle activation strategy and hence altered the magnitudes of ground reaction forces and joint loadings during landing. Subjectively, participants perceived higher landing impacts with greater drop heights, though the strength of the associations were weak.},

ABSTRACT = {In this study, we introduce an adaptive model-free coupling controller while using recurrent fuzzy neural network (RFNN) for multi-axis system to minimize the contour error. The proposed method can be applied to linear or nonlinear multi-axis motion control systems following desired paths. By the concept of cross-coupling control (CCC), multi-axis system is transferred into a nonlinear time-varying system due to the time-dependent coordinate transformation; tangential, normal, and bi-normal components of desired contour. Herein, we propose a model-free adaptive coupling controller design approach for multi-axis linear motor system with uncertainty and nonlinear phenomena. RFNN establishes the corresponding adaptive coupling controller to treat the uncertain system with nonlinear phenomenon. The stability of closed-loop system is guaranteed by the Lyapunov method and the adaptation of RFNN is also obtained. Simulation results are introduced in order to illustrate the effectiveness.},

ABSTRACT = {The friction-type high-strength bolted (FHSB) T-stub connection has been widely used in steel structures, due to their good fatigue resistance and ease of installation. While the current studies on FHSB T-stub connections mainly focus on the structural behaviors under both shear and tensile force, no research has been reported on the mechanical responses of the connections under the combined effects of shear and compression. To make up for this gap, this paper presents a novel FHSB T-stub connection, which is simple in structure, definite in load condition, and easy to construct. Static load tests were carried out on 21 specimens under different shear–compression ratios, and the finite-element (FE) models were created for each specimen. The failure modes, initial friction loads and ultimate strengths of the specimens were compared in details. Then, 144 FE models were adopted to analyze the effects of the friction coefficient, shear–compression ratio, bolt diameter and clamping force on the initial friction load and ultimate strength. The results showed that the FHSB T-stub connection under shear and compression mainly suffers from bolt shearing failure. The load–displacement curve generally covers the elastic, yield, hardening and failure stage. If the shear–compression ratio is small and the friction coefficient is large, its curve only contains the elastic and failure stage. The friction coefficient and shear–compression ratio have great impacts on the initial friction load and ultimate strength. For every 1 mm increase in bolt diameter, the initial friction load increased by about 10%, while the ultimate strength increased by about 8.5%. For each 10% increase/decrease of the design clamping force, the initial friction load decreases/increases by 7.8%, while the ultimate load remains basically the same. The proposed formula of shear capacity and self-lock angles of FHSB T-stub connection can be applied to the design of CSS-enhanced prestressed concrete continuous box girder bridges (PSC-CBGBs) and diagonal bracing.},

ABSTRACT = {Safety assessment of structures can be obtained employing limit design to overcome uncertainties concerning actual response due to inelastic constitutive behavior and more generally to non-linear structural response and loads’ random variability. The limit analysis is used for evaluating the safety of the structures, starting directly from load level without any knowledge of the load history. In the paper, the lower bound calculation is proposed where a new strain-based approach is used that allowed describing the residual stress and displacement in terms of permanent strain. The strategy uses the permanent strain as effective parameters of the procedure so that it is possible to assess the ductility requirements for the complete load program developed till collapse or shakedown. The procedure is compared to experimental results obtained on aluminum beams in shakedown.},

ABSTRACT = {Intelligent automation, including robotics, is one of the current trends in the manufacturing industry in the context of “Industry 4.0”, where cyber-physical systems control the production at automated or semi-automated factories. Robots are perfect substitutes for a skilled workforce for some repeatable, general, and strategically-important tasks. However, this transformation is not always feasible and immediate, since certain technologies do not provide the required degree of flexibility. The introduction of collaborative robots in the industry permits the combination of the advantages of manual and automated production. In some processes, it is necessary to incorporate robots from different manufacturers, thus the design of these multi-robot systems is crucial to guarantee the maximum quality and efficiency. In this context, this paper presents a novel methodology for process automation design, enhanced implementation, and real-time monitoring in operation based on creating a digital twin of the manufacturing process with an immersive virtual reality interface to be used as a virtual testbed before the physical implementation. Moreover, it can be efficiently used for operator training, real-time monitoring, and feasibility studies of future optimizations. It has been validated in a use case which provides a solution for an assembly manufacturing process.},

ABSTRACT = {Large oil and gas pipelines are prone to corrosion and leakage, so in-pipe inspection is necessary. In this article, we show a novel robot mechanism for long-distance pipeline inspection. The robot consists of three crawlers and electric putters, which can adjust their speed and radius independently. Independent adjustment and system self-checking of the robot are achieved through multiple sensors. To make the robot operate efficiently, we studied the influence of size parameters on the forces between the central body and crawler. Moreover, we investigated how to adjust the attitude of the robot through the differential speed of the three crawlers. Static and dynamic simulations of internal forces are presented. The primary experiments indicate that our robot can operate stably in a large steel pipe.},

ABSTRACT = {The aerodynamic performance of a high-speed train passing through tunnel junctions under severe crosswind condition was numerically investigated using improved delayed detached-eddy simulations (IDDES). Three ground scenarios connected with entrances and exits of tunnels were considered. In particular a flat ground, an embankment, and a bridge configuration were used. The numerical method was first validated against experimental data, showing good agreement. The results show that the ground scenario has a large effect on the train’s aerodynamic performance. The bridge case resulted in generally smaller drag and lift, as well as a lower pressure coefficient on both the train body and the inner tunnel wall, as compared to the tunnel junctions with flat ground and embankment. Furthermore, the bridge configuration contributed to the smallest pressure variation in time in the tunnel. Overall, the study gives important insights on complicated tunnel junction scenarios coupled with severe flow conditions, that, to the knowledge of the authors, were not studied before. Beside this, the results can be used for further improvements in the design of tunnels where such crosswind conditions may occur.},

ABSTRACT = {Due to the large lateral area of the trailer and variable road conditions, the handling stability of a heavy tractor semi-trailer under crosswind is very important for road safety. In this present work, numerical simulation is performed to study the crosswind effects on handling stability of a tractor semi-trailer. The aerodynamic characteristics of the tractor semi-trailer under different crosswind were computed by computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Then, mathematical models to reveal the relationship between the aerodynamic forces and crosswind were constructed to serve as inputs of the multi-body dynamics to analyze the handling stability under crosswind. The performance of crosswind stability is evaluated by the response of lateral acceleration, yaw rate and the lateral displacement. The lateral acceleration and yaw rate were decreased by a maximum of 14.6% and 16.5% compared to the truck without the deflector, which showed that the crosswind aerodynamics and stability were obviously improved.},

ABSTRACT = {Rotating blade vibration measurements are very important for any turbomachinery research and development program. The blade tip timing (BTT) technique uses the time of arrival (ToA) of the blade tip passing the casing mounted probes to give the blade vibration. As a non-contact technique, BTT is necessary for rotating blade vibration measurements. The higher accuracy of amplitude and vibration frequency identification has been pursued since the development of BTT. An improved circumferential Fourier fit (ICFF) method is proposed. In this method, the ToA is not only dependent on the rotating speed and monitoring position, but also on blade vibration. Compared with the traditional circumferential Fourier fit (TCFF) method, this improvement is more consistent with reality. A 12-blade assembly simulator and experimental data were used to evaluate the ICFF performance. The simulated results showed that the ICFF performance is comparable to TCFF in terms of EO identification, except the lower PSR or more number probes that have a more negative effect on ICFF. Besides, the accuracy of amplitude identification is higher for ICFF than TCFF on all test conditions. Meanwhile, the higher accuracy of the reconstruction of ICFF was further verified in all measurement resonance analysis.},

ABSTRACT = {Helmholtz resonators (HR) have been proven to have feasibility for sensor applications with good performance. However, for biosensor application, when the amount of test sample is limited, the operating frequency tends to be very high, which may bring challenges of resonance excitation and frequency measurement. In this paper, a modified HR was proposed for biosensor application at a lower frequency, by designing the neck of the HR as a type of an Archimedes spiral, which can increase the neck length as much as possible without occupying much space. The resonant frequency of the proposed HR was derived by treating it as an HR with a straight neck with the equivalent length. An analytical example was calculated and verified by acoustic finite element analysis, and the results clearly showed that the frequency decreases in comparison to that of the conventional HR. Based on the underlying theory, the measurement principle was proposed and the experiment setup was established using a 3D-printed structure. The experiment was done using test solutions with different glucose concentrations, whose results showed consistency with the analytical results and noticeable frequency increases with the glucose concentration. Prospective results of the proposed HR after miniaturization show an operating frequency around 3 kHz when the amount of test sample is 0.1 mL, which will facilitate use of the common acoustic power source and acoustic pressure sensors in the sensing system.},

ABSTRACT = {Robotic forceps with a rigid-link joint mechanism is orthodox for current robotic-assisted surgery systems. However, external force estimation without force sensors during operations is difficult for such electrically driven forceps. This work introduces a pneumatically driven multi-DOF (DOF: degree of freedom) forceps using a rigid-link mechanism with less interference of the wire drive between joints and realizes external force estimation by utilizing high back-drivability of pneumatic cylinders. We developed a position controller with dynamic compensation of the mechanical friction, in which the rotational angles of the three movable joints of the forceps are independently controlled. Moreover, we designed an external force observer in the position controller by applying the disturbance observer scheme. The results of the performance evaluation experiments are as follows. First, in the joint position control experiments, smooth and stable controllability is confirmed for sinusoidal reference inputs with the mean absolute errors of less than 2°. The resolution of the joint position control is approximately 1° for the response of step increasing reference inputs, which is acceptable for laparoscopic surgery. Second, the external force observer can correctly estimate the translational and the grasping forces with less than 20% errors of the maximum output forces. The practical sensitivities of the external force estimation are better than 0.5 N for translational forces and 0.2 N for grasping forces. The achieved performance of the developed forceps can be applicable for interactive force control in some particular surgical tasks such as suturing, ligation, organ traction and exclusion.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper is focused on the development of a Cellular Automata algorithm with the refined mesh adaptation technique and the implementation of this algorithm in topology optimization problems. Traditionally, a Cellular Automaton is created based on regular discretization of the design domain into a lattice of cells, the states of which are updated by applying simple local rules. It is expected that during the topology optimization process the local rules responsible for the evaluation of cell states can drive the solution to solid/void resulting structures. In the proposed approach, the finite elements are equivalent to cells of an automaton and the states of cells are represented by design variables. While optimizing engineering structural elements, the important issue is to obtain well-defined solutions: in particular, topologies with smooth boundaries. The quality of the structural topology boundaries depends on the resolution level of mesh discretization: the greater the number of elements in the mesh, the better the representation of the optimized structure. However, the use of fine meshes implies a high computational cost. We propose, therefore, an adaptive way to refine the mesh. This allowed us to reduce the number of design variables without losing the accuracy of results and without an excessive increase in the number of elements caused by use of a fine mesh for a whole structure. In particular, it is not necessary to cover void regions with a very fine mesh. The implementation of a fine grid is expected mainly in the so-called grey regions where it has to be decided whether a cell becomes solid or void. The benefit of the proposed approach, besides the possibility of obtaining high-resolution, sharply resolved fine optimal topologies with a relatively low computational cost, is also that the checkerboard effect, mesh dependency, and the so-called grey areas can be eliminated without using any additional filtering. Moreover, the algorithm presented is versatile, which allows its easy combination with any structural analysis solver built on the finite element method.},

Under EN 1078 standardized impact conditions, the results of simulated impact tests show that the helmet can absorb 40% to 50% of the total impact energy at impact velocities above 4 m/s. Further, based on a relationship between the head injury criterion and the risk of injury from field data, the results of the simulations suggest that minor injuries may occur at impact velocities of 10 km/h, serious injuries at 15 km/h, and severe injuries at 20 km/h. Fatal injuries will likely occur at impact velocities of 30 km/h and higher.},

ABSTRACT = {The adaptive chirp mode decomposition method has a good effect on processing chirp signals. The parameter α controls the smoothness of the output signal. Too small an α will cause a smooth output signal. The parameter β controls the instantaneous frequency (IF). If too small a β value is used, the output IF will be very smooth. However, rapidly changing IFs require a relatively large β. However, the choice of α,β is artificially set, and there are errors in practical applications. Therefore, it employs the state transition algorithm to adaptively optimize α,β to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and resolution of the signal. First, as the species number of the state transition algorithm method is set artificially and has a long running time, this paper proposes a Rastrigin optimization test equation to test the optimization time of different species and determine the number of optimal species; second, the state transition algorithm determined by the number of species is employed to adaptively find the α,β in the adaptive chirp mode decomposition algorithm; finally, the optimized adaptive chirp mode decomposition method is applied to the simulation signal and chirp signal from marine animals to verify the proposed method.},

ABSTRACT = {Reducing friction is an important aspect to increase the efficiency of internal combustion engines (ICE). The majority of frictional losses in engines are related to both the piston skirt and piston ring–cylinder liner (PRCL) arrangement. We studied the enhancement of the conformation of the PRCL arrangement based on the assumption that a suitable conical liner in its cold state may deform into a liner with nearly straight parallel walls in the fired state due to the impact of mechanical and thermal stresses. Combining the initially conical shape with a noncircular cross section will bring the liner even closer to the perfect cylindrical shape in the fired state. Hence, a significant friction reduction can be expected. For the investigation, the numerical method was first developed to simulate the liner deformation with advanced finite element methods. This was validated with given experimental data of the deformation for a gasoline engine in its fired state. In the next step, initially conically and/or elliptically shaped liners were investigated for their deformation between the cold and fired state. It was found that, for liners being both conical and elliptical in their cold state, a significant increase of straightness, parallelism, and roundness was reached in the fired state. The combined elliptical-conical liner led to a reduced straightness error by more than 50% compared to the cylindrical liner. The parallelism error was reduced by 60% to 70% and the roundness error was reduced between 70% and 80% at different liner positions. These numerical results show interesting potential for the friction reduction in the piston-liner arrangement within internal combustion engines.},

ABSTRACT = {In early design phases of ball typed constant velocity joints (CVJ), which are widely used for the uniform transmission of rotational movement in driveshafts, the knowledge of the interactions between the components is essential. Therefore, a simulation model for a multi-body analysis is developed to consider general, transient operating conditions of the joint in the development process. The model is derived using the example of a plunging joint of the rear prop shaft, which has a straight track geometry and two track angles. On this basis, a two-dimensional, analytical contact determination between balls and tracks can be carried out, which reduces the required computation times compared to a general contact determination. Although rigid bodies are used for numerical analysis, local elastic deformations between the contact bodies are possible on the basis of Hertzian contact theory. For a higher level of detail, frictional forces are also taken into account via the Coulomb friction law, which is adapted for numerical use. To validate the simulation model, the influences of the numerical parameters are discussed and the numerical results are compared with the analytical results of the statically undeflected joint condition. Finally, the created simulation model is utilised to present the numerical joint analysis using two examples of joint kinematics analysis.},

ABSTRACT = {Aerial operation with unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) manipulator is a promising field for future applications. However, the quadrotor UAV manipulator usually suffers from several disturbances, such as external wind and model uncertainties, when conducting aerial tasks, which will seriously influence the stability of the whole system. In this paper, we address the problem of high-precision attitude control for quadrotor manipulator which is equipped with a 2-degree-of-freedom (DOF) robotic arm under disturbances. We propose a new sliding-mode extended state observer (SMESO) to estimate the lumped disturbance and build a backstepping attitude controller to attenuate its influence. First, we use the saturation function to replace discontinuous sign function of traditional SMESO to alleviate the estimation chattering problem. Second, by innovatively introducing super-twisting algorithm and fuzzy logic rules used for adaptively updating the observer switching gains, the fuzzy adaptive saturation super-twisting extended state observer (FASTESO) is constructed. Finally, in order to further reduce the impact of sensor noise, we invite a tracking differentiator (TD) incorporated into FASTESO. The proposed control approach is validated with effectiveness in several simulations and experiments in which we try to fly UAV under varied external disturbances.},

ABSTRACT = {One of the major limitations of existing unmanned aerial vehicles is limited flight endurance. In this study, we designed an innovative uninterrupted electromagnetic propulsion device for high-endurance missions of a quadcopter drone for the lucrative exploration of earth and other planets with atmospheres. As an airborne platform, this device could achieve scientific objectives better than state-of-the-art revolving spacecraft and walking robots, without any terrain limitation. We developed a mixed reality simulation based on a quadcopter drone and an X-Plane flight simulator. A computer with the X-Plane flight simulator represented the virtual part, and a real quadcopter operating within an airfield represented the real part. In the first phase of our study, we developed a connection interface between the X-Plane flight simulator and the quadcopter ground control station in MATLAB. The experimental results generated from the Earth’s atmosphere show that the flight data from the real and the virtual quadcopters are precise and very close to the prescribed target. The proof-of-concept of the mixed reality simulation of the quadcopter at the Earth atmosphere was verified and validated through several experimental flights of the F450 spider quadcopter with a Pixhawk flight controller with the restricted endurance at the airfield location of Hangang Drone Park in Seoul, South Korea.

ABSTRACT = {As the development of the polar region continues to increase, the fatigue properties of structures at low temperature are increasingly receiving researcher attention. This study aimed to investigate the fatigue properties of T-welded and cruciform welded joints at −60 °C. Logarithmic S–N curves based on the hot-spot stress of the T-welded and cruciform welded joints at 50% and 95% confidence levels were obtained at −60 °C. The test results showed that the fatigue properties of T-welded joints were almost 2–7% better than those of the cruciform welded joints at −60 °C. Factors that affected the fatigue properties of welded joints, such as the stress concentration factor, microstructure, Vickers hardness profiles, and fractography, were also studied and the test results showed that the fatigue properties of cruciform welded joints at −60 °C were 57.215% better than at room temperature.},

ABSTRACT = {In the in-line four-cylinder engine, it is well known that the shaking force is due to the vertical second harmonic acceleration components of the pistons. This paper proposes a kinematic conceptual design method to determine the kinematic structure of a feasible in-line four-cylinder variable compression ratio (VCR) engine and its dimensions that would yield a lower vertical second harmonic acceleration at joints. Through type and dimensional synthesis, candidate VCR engine mechanisms are chosen and their dimensions satisfying design specifications are determined. Based on the analysis of the vertical second harmonic acceleration components at the joints, a feasible mechanism for an in-line four-cylinder VCR engine is selected. Then, the method finds the dimensions that yield a nearly minimized sum of the vertical second harmonic acceleration at each joint by adjusting the link lengths within specified tolerances. For validation, the result is compared with that of a constrained optimization using MATLAB. The proposed method would be useful at the conceptual design stage of multi-link multi-cylinder VCR and variable-stroke engine mechanisms where the second harmonic acceleration is an important design factor in the automotive industrial applications.},

ABSTRACT = {The stability of agricultural machines, earth-moving machines, snow-compaction machines and, in general, of all vehicles that may operate on sloping terrains is a very important technical feature and should not be underestimated. In fact, it is correlated, above all, to the safety of the operators, but also to the preservation of the structural integrity of these vehicles, to the prosecution of the activities and to the preservation of the economic investment. Although these facts are well-known, the international legislation and technical standards do not yet have a sufficient level of detail to give an all-inclusive quantification of the stability of the vehicle under examination in all its working conditions, e.g., at different inclination angles of the support surface, at different climbing angles of the vehicle on the slope, with different tires and inflating pressures, and on different terrains. Actual standards limit the stability tests to the experimental measurement of the lateral rollover angle only. Furthermore, the realization of unconventional test equipment able to widen the usually-tested scenarios could not be simple, due to the necessary size that such equipment should have (to perform tests not in scale) and to the related difficulties of handling full-scale vehicles. This work illustrates the applications of a new rig for testing the stability of vehicles, able to address all the above-illustrated issues and of possible future adoption to certify the stability performance of machines and perform homologations. This installation, named “rotating platform” or “turntable”, has the peculiarity of being able to move the machine positioned on it according to two rotational degrees of freedom: (1) overall inclination of the support plane, (2) rotation of the support plane around an axis perpendicular to the plane. The same installation is also designed to record the weight supported by each wheel of the machine placed on it (by means of four sensorized quadrants), both when the platform is motionless and while the above-described movements of tilt and rotation are being carried out, thus locating precisely the spatial position of the vehicle center of gravity. The presented physical-mathematical models highlight the great potential of this facility, anticipate the outcomes of the recordings that the experimenters will have at disposal when the test rig will be effectively active, and help the future understanding of trends of data, thus maximizing the available information content.},

ABSTRACT = {Material extrusion (ME), an extrusion-based rapid prototyping technique, has been extensively studied to manufacture final functional products, whose forming quality is significantly influenced by the melt flow behavior (MFB) inside the extrusion liquefier. Applied vibration has a great potential to improve the MFB, and thereby promote the forming quality of the built product. To reveal the mechanism, a dynamic model of the melt flow behavior (DMMFB) is established based on fluid dynamics, Tanner nonlinear constitutive equation and Newton’s power law equation. The MFB, i.e., pressure drop, shear stress and apparent viscosity, is investigated without and with different vibration applied. The corresponding finite element analysis (FEA) is then carried out. From the comparison between DMMFB and FEA results, it is concluded that the proposed model is reliable. When vibration is applied onto the extrusion liquefier, the time-domain MFB will change periodically. Its effective value decreases significantly, and further decreases with the increase of vibration frequency or amplitude. This paper provides the theoretical basis to improve the MFB by applied vibration, and thereby to enhance the forming quality of ME products.},

ABSTRACT = {The market for agricultural machinery is characterized by products with a high degree of maturity in the product life cycle. Consequently, current improvements in new machinery are predominantly incremental and new projects basically use solutions that are already consolidated. This makes this domain appropriate for benchmarking existing systems and envisioning new value propositions. The present paper deals primarily with the former and uses the value curves as a means to structure the comparison among different families of technical systems; in particular, harvesting machines for shell fruits from the ground surface, e.g., chestnuts, walnuts, and hazelnuts, were investigated here. The process of building value curves requires the identification of currently fulfilled requirements. Despite the attention paid by engineering design research to requirements, a structured process is lacking to extract relevant information and create value curves or other representations useful for benchmarking. The present paper approaches this problem and presents how the authors have individuated relevant knowledge for characterizing different categories of harvesting machines. Namely, after an extensive search of the scientific literature and patents, a critical review of existing machines, aimed at individuating their functioning principles, architecture, and attitude in fulfilling specific design requirements, was performed. Then, existing machines were classified in 8 main categories, and their strengths and weaknesses were identified with reference to 11 competing factors. The consequent construction of value curves enabled the identification of possible points of intervention by hypothesizing possible future evolutions of such machinery, both in a structural and in a value-based perspective. Limitations about the repeatability of the followed approach and possible repercussions on design research are discussed.},

ABSTRACT = {Robots are gaining a foothold day-by-day in different areas of people’s lives. Collaborative robots (cobots) need to display human-like dynamic performance. Thus, the question of safety during physical human–robot interaction (pHRI) arises. Herein, we propose making serial cobots intrinsically compliant to guarantee safe pHRI via our novel designed device, V2SOM (variable stiffness safety-oriented mechanism). Integrating this new device at each rotary joint of the serial cobot ensures a safe pHRI and reduces the drawbacks of making robots compliant. Thanks to its two continuously linked functional modes—high and low stiffness—V2SOM presents a high inertia decoupling capacity, which is a necessary condition for safe pHRI. The high stiffness mode eases the control without disturbing the safety aspect. Once a human–robot (HR) collision occurs, a spontaneous and smooth shift to low stiffness mode is passively triggered to safely absorb the impact. To highlight V2SOM’s effect in safety terms, we consider two complementary safety criteria: impact force (ImpF) criterion and head injury criterion (HIC) for external and internal damage evaluation of blunt shocks, respectively. A pre-established HR collision model is built in Matlab/Simulink (v2018, MathWorks, France) in order to evaluate the latter criterion. This paper presents the first V2SOM prototype, with quasi-static and dynamic experimental evaluations.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper proposes a novel control approach for a robot gripper in which the impedance control, fuzzy logic control, and iterative learning control are combined in the same control schema. The impedance control is used to keep the gripping force at the desired value. The fuzzy impedance controller is designed to estimate the best impedance parameters in real time when gripping unknown objects. The iterative learning control process is employed to optimize the sample dataset for designing the rule base to enhance the effectiveness of the fuzzy impedance controller. Besides, the real-time gripping force estimator is designed to keep an unknown object from sliding down when picking it up. The simulation and experiment are implemented to verify the proposed method. The comparison with another control method is also made by repeating the experiments under equivalent conditions. The results show the feasibility and superiority of the proposed method.},

ABSTRACT = {Presented in this paper is an in-depth analysis of the impact of engine start during various stages of engine warm up (cold, intermediate, and hot start stages) on the performance and emissions of a heavy-duty diesel engine. The experiments were performed at constant engine speeds of 1500 and 2000 rpm on a custom designed drive cycle. The intermediate start stage was found to be longer than the cold start stage. The oil warm up lagged the coolant warm up by approximately 10 °C. During the cold start stage, as the coolant temperature increased from ~25 to 60 °C, the brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) decreased by approximately 2% to 10%. In the intermediate start stage, as the coolant temperature reached 70 °C and the injection retarded, the indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP) and the brake mean effective pressure (BMEP) decreased by approximately 2% to 3%, while the friction mean effective pressure (FMEP) decreased by approximately 60%. In this stage, the NOx emissions decreased by approximately 25% to 45%, while the HC emissions increased by approximately 12% to 18%. The normalised FMEP showed that higher energy losses at lower loads were most likely contributing to the heating of the lubricating oil.},

ABSTRACT = {Due to the complexity of the internal flow field of compressors, the aerodynamic design and optimization of a highly loaded axial compressor with high performance still have three problems, which are rich engineering design experience, high dimensions, and time-consuming calculations. To overcome these three problems, this paper takes an engineering-designed 2.5-stage highly loaded axial flow compressor as an example to introduce the design process and the adopted design philosophies. Then, this paper verifies the numerical method of computational fluid dynamics. A new Bezier surface modeling method for the entire suction surface and pressure surface of blades is developed, and the multi-island genetic algorithm is directly used for further optimization. Only 32 optimization variables are used to optimize the rotors and stators of the compressor, which greatly overcome the problem of high dimensions, time-consuming calculations, and smooth blade surfaces. After optimization, compared with the original compressor, the peak efficiency is still improved by 0.12%, and the stall margin is increased by 2.69%. The increase in peak efficiency is mainly due to the rotors. Compared with the original compressor, for the second-stage rotor, the adiabatic efficiency is improved by about 0.4%, which is mainly due to the decreases of total pressure losses in the range of above 30% of the span height and 10%–30% of the chord length. Besides, for the original compressor, due to deterioration of the flow field near the tip region of the second-stage stator, the large low-speed region eventually evolves from corner separation into corner stall with three-dimensional space spiral backflow. For the optimized compressor, the main reason for the increased stall margin is that the flow field of the second-stage stator with a span height above 50% is improved, and the separation area and three-dimensional space spiral backflow are reduced.},
