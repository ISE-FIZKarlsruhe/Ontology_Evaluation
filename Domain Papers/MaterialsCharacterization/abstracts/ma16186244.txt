This paper presents a new solution for shaping the rivet progression of a beverage end. The classic method uses three operations to press the cylindrical rivet using 0.208 mm and 0.203 mm thick sheets. The increasing demand for aluminium alloys is prompting measures to make more efficient use of this raw material. One possible solution is to produce packaging from ever thinner sheets. This requires the design of new tooling and the preparation of an appropriate technological process. A method has been developed to stamp a hexagonal-shaped rivet from 0.200 mm thick sheet metal, increasing the number of stamping operations to four. The proposed method was verified through a numerical analysis using the PAM STAMP 2022.0 software package. It was found that for appropriately shaped tools, sheet thicknesses of the stamped component could be achieved that were not less than those for the currently used technology, thus eliminating any possible break in the material structure. Suitable tools and experimental stamping tests were carried out for the developed process. In the simulations, the material Al5182_iso_Xmm was adopted from the programme database, while the experiments were performed on a laboratory press using AW-5182-H48 sheets with a thickness of 0.200 mm. The purpose of the study was to determine the validity for the proposed method of forming the rivet of the beverage end.
