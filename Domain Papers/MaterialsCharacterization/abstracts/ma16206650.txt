The article discusses the utilization of Pulsed Multifrequency Excitation and Spectrogram Eddy Current Testing (PMFES-ECT) in conjunction with the supervised learning method for the purpose of estimating defect parameters in conductive materials. To obtain estimates for these parameters, a three-dimensional finite element method model was developed for the sensor and specimen containing defects. The outcomes obtained from the simulation were employed as training data for the k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm. Subsequently, the k-NN algorithm was employed to determine the defect parameters by leveraging the available measurement outcomes. The evaluation of classification accuracy for different combinations of predictors derived from measured data is also presented in this study.
