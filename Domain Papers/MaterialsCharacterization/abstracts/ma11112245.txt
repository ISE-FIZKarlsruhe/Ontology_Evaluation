Inclusion of rubber into concrete changes its behavior and the established shape of its stress-strain curve. Existing constitutive stress-strain models for concrete are not valid in case of rubberized concrete, and currently available modified models require additional validation on a larger database of experimental results, with a wider set of influential parameters. By executing uniaxial compressive tests on concrete with rubber substituting 10%, 20%, 30%, and 40% of aggregate, it was possible to study and evaluate the influence of rubber content on its mechanical behavior. The stress-strain curve was investigated in its entirety, including compressive strength, elastic modulus, strains at significant levels of stress, and failure patterns. Experimental results indicated that increase of rubber content linearly decreases compressive strength and elastic modulus, but increases ductility. By comparing experimental stress-strain curves with those plotted using available constitutive stress-strain models it was concluded that they are inadequate for rubberized concrete with high rubber content. Based on determined deviations an improvement of an existing model was proposed, which provides better agreement with experimental curves. Obtained research results enabled important insights into correlations between rubber content and changes of the stress-strain curve required when utilizing nonlinear material properties.
