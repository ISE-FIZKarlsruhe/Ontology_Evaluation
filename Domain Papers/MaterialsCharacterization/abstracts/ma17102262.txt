The precipitation-hardenable nickel-based superalloy Rene 41 exhibits remarkable mechanical characteristics and high corrosion resistance at high temperatures, properties that allow it to be used in high-end applications. This research paper presents findings on the influence of thermal shocks on its microstructure, hardness, and thermal diffusivity at temperatures between 700 and 1000 Â°C. Solar energy was used for cyclic thermal shock tests. The samples were characterized using microhardness measurements, optical microscopic analysis, scanning electron microscopy coupled with EDS elemental chemical analysis, X-ray diffraction, and flash thermal diffusivity measurements. Structural transformations and the variation of properties were observed with an increase in the number of shocks applied at the same temperature and with temperature variation for the same number of thermal shocks.
