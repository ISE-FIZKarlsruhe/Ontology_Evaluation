Environment-friendly medium-density fiberboards (MDFs) prepared using sodium lignosulfonate/chitosan adhesives (L/C) show potential in environment-friendly wood-based panel application. However, the synthesis mechanism of this adhesive and the relationships between synthesis mechanism and bonding performance were not discussed in depth. Herein, the synthesis mechanism of L/C was explored in detail based on characterizations of L/C with different mass ratios of sodium lignosulfonate to chitosan by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, and X-ray diffraction. For L/C with different mass ratios of sodium lignosulfonate to chitosan, the corresponding bonding performance was also determined based on characterizations of mechanical and dimensional performance of MDFs. Results showed a 3D network structure of L/C formed through the hydrogen linkages among hydroxyl groups in sodium lignosulfonate and hydroxyl and amino groups in chitosan, amide linkages resulted from reaction between carbonyl groups in sodium lignosulfonate and amino groups in chitosan, and sulfonamide linkages originated from reaction between sulfonic groups in sodium lignosulfonate and amino groups in chitosan. The mechanical performance of MDF was closely related to the 3D network and amino groups of L/C, while the dimensional performance of MDF was negatively affected by sodium lignosulfonate. The MDFs with 1:3 and 1:2 mass ratios of sodium lignosulfonate to chitosan showed superior mechanical properties and comparable dimensional performance with a commercial panel.
