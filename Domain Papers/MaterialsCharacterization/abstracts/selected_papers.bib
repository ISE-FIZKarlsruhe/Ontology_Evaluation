 abstract = {The antifungal, antibacterial, and antioxidant activity of four commercial essential oils (EOs) (thyme, clove, rosemary, and tea tree) from Romanian production were studied in order to assess them as bioactive compounds for active food packaging applications. The chemical composition of the oils was determined with the Folin–Ciocâlteu method and gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry and flame ionization detectors, and it was found that they respect the AFNOR/ISO standard limits. The EOs were tested against three food spoilage fungi—Fusarium graminearum, Penicillium corylophilum, and Aspergillus brasiliensis—and three potential pathogenic food bacteria—Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Listeria monocytogenes—using the disc diffusion method. It was found that the EOs of thyme, clove, and tea tree can be used as antimicrobial agents against the tested fungi and bacteria, thyme having the highest inhibitory effect. Concerning antioxidant activity determined by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2’-azino-bis 3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) methods, it has been established that the clove oil exhibits the highest activity because of its high phenolic content. Promising results were obtained by their incorporation into chitosan emulsions and films, which show potential for food packaging. Therefore, these essential oils could be suitable alternatives to chemical additives, satisfying the consumer demand for naturally preserved food products ensuring its safety.},

 abstract = {High temperature surface acoustic wave sensors based on radio frequency identification technology require adequate antennas of high efficiency and thermal stability for the signal transmission. Platinum is well known and frequently used as a material of choice for high temperature and harsh environment applications because of the high melting point and its chemical stability. Therefore, one way to realize high temperature stable antennas is the combination of a Pt metallization on an Al 2 O 3 substrate. As a cost-effective technique, the Pt film is deposited via electrochemical deposition. For this growth procedure, a pre-deposited metallization on the Al 2 O 3 layer is required. This paper analyzes the influence of various seed layers (Ta, Ti, W, Cr, Pt) on the morphology, stability and electrical properties of the electrochemically-grown Pt thick film after heat treatments up to 1000 ∘ C in air. We find an oxidation of all adhesion layers except for Pt, for which the best electrical properties were measured. Although significant areas of the films delaminate from the substrate, individual anchor structures retain a stable connection between the Pt layer and the rough Al 2 O 3 substrate.},

The results showed that the increased Li element gradually transformed the Mg matrix structure from hcp to bcc. Simultaneously, the alloy plasticity was improved remarkably during cold rolling. In the annealing process, a sort of abnormal grain growth was found in Mg-11Li-3Al-2Zn-0.2Y, but was not detected in Mg-5Li-3Al-2Zn-0.2Y and Mg-8Li-3Al-2Zn-0.2Y.

To accurately quantify this strengthening effect, the method of mathematical modeling was used to determine the relationship between strength and multiple factors.},

 abstract = {An accurate determination of particle-level fabric of granular soils from tomography data requires a maximum correct separation of particles. The popular marker-controlled watershed separation method is widely used to separate particles. However, the watershed method alone is not capable of producing the maximum separation of particles when subjected to boundary stresses leading to crushing of particles. In this paper, a new separation method, named as Monash Particle Separation Method (MPSM), has been introduced. The new method automatically determines the optimal contrast coefficient based on cluster evaluation framework to produce the maximum accurate separation outcomes. Finally, the particles which could not be separated by the optimal contrast coefficient were separated by integrating cuboid markers generated from the clustering by Gaussian mixture models into the routine watershed method. The MPSM was validated on a uniformly graded sand volume subjected to one-dimensional compression loading up to 32 MPa. It was demonstrated that the MPSM is capable of producing the best possible separation of particles required for the fabric analysis.},

The microstructure and photoluminescence (PL) property of SnO2 and FTO NPs have been investigated, and an assumption model about the luminescence process of FTO NPs has been proposed. All of the SnO2 and FTO NPs possess polycrystalline tetragonal rutile structures, and the average size in the range of 16.5–20.2 nm decreases with the increasing of F doping content. The doping element F is shown a uniformly distribution by electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) mapping. The oxygen vacancy concentration becomes higher as is verified by Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS). There are three kinds of oxygen chemical states in SnO2 and FTO NPs, in which Oα corresponds to oxygen vacancies. The room temperature PL position is observed to be independent of F doping content. F− may substitute O2− into the SnO2 lattice by generating F O + and one extra e−, which can combine with V O + or V O + + to generate V O 0 or V O + to ensure charge balance.},

Symmetric half-cells with a proton-conducting BaZr0.9Y0.1O3−δ electrolyte were prepared by ceramic processing, and good chemical compatibility of the materials was demonstrated. Both A-site ordered LaBaCo2O5+δ and A-site disordered La0.5Ba0.5CoO3−δ yield excellent cathode performance with Area Specific Resistances as low as 7.4 and 11.5 Ω·cm2 at 400 °C and 0.16 and 0.32 Ω·cm2 at 600 °C in 3% humidified synthetic air respectively. The oxygen vacancy concentration, electrical conductivity, basicity of cations and crystal structure were evaluated to rationalize the electrochemical performance of the two materials. The combination of high-basicity elements and high electrical conductivity as well as sufficient oxygen vacancy concentration explains the excellent performance of both LaBaCo2O5+δ and La0.5Ba0.5CoO3−δ materials at high temperatures. At lower temperatures, oxygen-deficiency in both materials is greatly reduced, leading to decreased performance despite the high basicity and electrical conductivity. A-site cation ordering leads to a higher oxygen vacancy concentration, which explains the better performance of LaBaCo2O5+δ. Finally, the more pronounced oxygen deficiency of the cation ordered polymorph and the lower chemical stability at reducing conditions were confirmed by coulometric titration.},

Existing constitutive stress-strain models for concrete are not valid in case of rubberized concrete, and currently available modified models require additional validation on a larger database of experimental results, with a wider set of influential parameters. By executing uniaxial compressive tests on concrete with rubber substituting 10%, 20%, 30%, and 40% of aggregate, it was possible to study and evaluate the influence of rubber content on its mechanical behavior. The stress-strain curve was investigated in its entirety, including compressive strength, elastic modulus, strains at significant levels of stress, and failure patterns. Experimental results indicated that increase of rubber content linearly decreases compressive strength and elastic modulus, but increases ductility. By comparing experimental stress-strain curves with those plotted using available constitutive stress-strain models it was concluded that they are inadequate for rubberized concrete with high rubber content. Based on determined deviations an improvement of an existing model was proposed, which provides better agreement with experimental curves. Obtained research results enabled important insights into correlations between rubber content and changes of the stress-strain curve required when utilizing nonlinear material properties.},

Considering the fact that companies all over the world desire alloys with the highest values of mechanical properties often coexisting with a reasonable electrical conductivity made it necessary to develop new materials based on Cu, such as CuMg alloys. However, before such new material may be mass produced it must undergo a series of tests in order to determine the production technology, its parameters and influence on the chemical composition, microstructural properties, and both mechanical and physical properties of CuMg alloys. The research tests have shown that with the increase of the casting feed the Brinell’s hardness of each material slightly increases (by 5 HB2.5/62.5). There is little to none impact of the casting feed on the electrical conductivity, values of which are between 20.6 and 21.4 MS/m (around 40% IACS-International Annealed Copper Standard) depending on the Mg content. The conducted scanning electron microstopy (SEM) analysis has shown that the magnesium precipitations are evenly distributed among the volume of the alloy, however, a significant difference in the density and shape of the Cu + Cu2Mg aggregates was noticed regarding various casting feed. Static compression test proved that these alloys may be subjected to strain hardening as the hardness of the material after compression increases by approximately 40 HB2.5/62.5.},

We describe the thermal desorption data processing, artificial neural network architecture development, and the learning process beneficial for the accuracy of the developed artificial neural network model. A data augmentation procedure was proposed to increase the diversity of the input data and improve the generalization of the model.

Herein, the synthesis mechanism of L/C was explored in detail based on characterizations of L/C with different mass ratios of sodium lignosulfonate to chitosan by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, and X-ray diffraction. For L/C with different mass ratios of sodium lignosulfonate to chitosan, the corresponding bonding performance was also determined based on characterizations of mechanical and dimensional performance of MDFs. Results showed a 3D network structure of L/C formed through the hydrogen linkages among hydroxyl groups in sodium lignosulfonate and hydroxyl and amino groups in chitosan, amide linkages resulted from reaction between carbonyl groups in sodium lignosulfonate and amino groups in chitosan, and sulfonamide linkages originated from reaction between sulfonic groups in sodium lignosulfonate and amino groups in chitosan. The mechanical performance of MDF was closely related to the 3D network and amino groups of L/C, while the dimensional performance of MDF was negatively affected by sodium lignosulfonate.

The classic method uses three operations to press the cylindrical rivet using 0.208 mm and 0.203 mm thick sheets. The increasing demand for aluminium alloys is prompting measures to make more efficient use of this raw material. One possible solution is to produce packaging from ever thinner sheets. This requires the design of new tooling and the preparation of an appropriate technological process. A method has been developed to stamp a hexagonal-shaped rivet from 0.200 mm thick sheet metal, increasing the number of stamping operations to four. The proposed method was verified through a numerical analysis using the PAM STAMP 2022.0 software package. It was found that for appropriately shaped tools, sheet thicknesses of the stamped component could be achieved that were not less than those for the currently used technology, thus eliminating any possible break in the material structure. Suitable tools and experimental stamping tests were carried out for the developed process. In the simulations, the material Al5182_iso_Xmm was adopted from the programme database, while the experiments were performed on a laboratory press using AW-5182-H48 sheets with a thickness of 0.200 mm. The purpose of the study was to determine the validity for the proposed method of forming the rivet of the beverage end.},

They are used to investigate surfaces with scanning ranges between several 100 mm down to atomic resolution. Depending on experimental conditions, and the interaction forces between probe and sample, different SPM techniques allow mapping of different surface properties. In this work, scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) in air and under electrochemical conditions (EC-STM), atomic force microscopy (AFM) in air and scanning electrochemical potential microscopy (SECPM) under electrochemical conditions, were used to study different single crystalline surfaces in electrochemistry. Especially SECPM offers potentially new insights into the solid-liquid interface by providing the possibility to image the potential distribution of the surface, with a resolution that is comparable to STM. In electrocatalysis, nanostructured catalysts supported on different electrode materials often show behavior different from their bulk electrodes. This was experimentally and theoretically shown for several combinations and recently on Pt on Au(111) towards fuel cell relevant reactions. For these investigations single crystals often provide accurate and well defined reference and support systems. We will show heteroepitaxially grown Ru, Ir and Rh single crystalline surface films and bulk Au single crystals with different orientations under electrochemical conditions. Image studies from all three different SPM methods will be presented and compared to electrochemical data obtained by cyclic voltammetry in acidic media. The quality of the single crystalline supports will be verified by the SPM images and the cyclic voltammograms.

In this work FSW and LAFSW tests were conducted on 6 mm thick 5754H111 aluminum alloy plates in butt joint configuration. LAFSW is studied firstly to demonstrate the weldability of aluminum alloy using that technique. Secondly, process parameters, such as laser power and temperature gradient are investigated in order to evaluate changes in microstructure, micro-hardness, residual stress, and tensile properties. Once the possibility to achieve sound weld using LAFSW is demonstrated, it will be possible to explore the benefits for tool wear, higher welding speeds, and lower clamping force.},

 abstract = {In this paper, Nd3+–Yb3+–Er3+-doped β-NaYF4 nanocrystals with different Nd3+ concentrations are synthesized, and the luminescence properties of the upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) have been studied under 808-nm excitation for sensitive biological applications. The upconversion luminescence spectra of NaYF4 nanoparticles with different dopants under 808-nm excitation proves that the Nd3+ ion can absorb the photons effectively, and the Yb3+ ion can play the role of an energy-transfer bridging ion between the Nd3+ ion and Er3+ ion. To investigate the effect of the Nd3+ ion, the decay curves of the 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 transition at 540 nm are measured and analyzed. The NaYF4: 20% Yb3+, 2% Er3+, 0.5% Nd3+ nanocrystals have the highest emission intensity among all samples under 808-nm excitation. The UC (upconversion) mechanism under 808-nm excitation is discussed in terms of the experimental results.},

@article{ma8085250,
 abstract = {In this work, the plastic deformation mechanisms responsible for mechanical properties and fracture toughness in nanotwinned (NT) magnesium is studied by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. The influence of twin boundary (TBs) spacing and crack position on deformation behaviors are investigated. The microstructure evolution at the crack tip are not exactly the same for the left edge crack (LEC) and the right edge crack (REC) models according to calculations of the energy release rate for dislocation nucleation at the crack tip. The LEC growth initiates in a ductile pattern and then turns into a brittle cleavage. In the REC model, the atomic decohesion occurs at the crack tip to create a new free surface which directly induces a brittle cleavage. A ductile to brittle transition is observed which mainly depends on the competition between dislocation motion and crack growth. This competition mechanism is found to be correlated with the TB spacing. The critical values are 10 nm and 13.5 nm for this transition in LEC and REC models, respectively. Essentially, the dislocation densities affected by the TB spacing play a crucial role in the ductile to brittle transition.},
