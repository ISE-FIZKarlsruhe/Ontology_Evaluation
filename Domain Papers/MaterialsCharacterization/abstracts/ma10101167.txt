The microstructural evolution, mechanical properties, and mathematical relationship of an α, α + β, and β phase Mg-Li alloy during the cold rolling and annealing process were investigated. The results showed that the increased Li element gradually transformed the Mg matrix structure from hcp to bcc. Simultaneously, the alloy plasticity was improved remarkably during cold rolling. In the annealing process, a sort of abnormal grain growth was found in Mg-11Li-3Al-2Zn-0.2Y, but was not detected in Mg-5Li-3Al-2Zn-0.2Y and Mg-8Li-3Al-2Zn-0.2Y. Moreover, the mechanical properties of alloy were evidently improved through a kind of solid solution in the β matrix. To accurately quantify this strengthening effect, the method of mathematical modeling was used to determine the relationship between strength and multiple factors.
