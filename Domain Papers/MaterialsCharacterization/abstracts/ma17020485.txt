In light of the urgent need to develop environmentally friendly materials that, at some point, will allow the reduction of concrete and, consequently, cement consumption—while at the same time allowing the reuse of waste and industrial by-products—alkali-activated fly ash (AAFA) geopolymer composite emerges as a material of great interest. The aim of this study was to investigate the physico-mechanical performance of composites based on AAFA binders and the effect of different types of aggregates on these properties. The experimental results indicate variations in flexural and compressive strength, which are influenced both by the nature and particle size distribution of aggregates and the binder-to-aggregate ratio. The analysis of the samples highlighted changes in porosity, both in distribution and pore size, depending on the nature of the aggregates. This supports the evolution of physico-mechanical performance indicators.
