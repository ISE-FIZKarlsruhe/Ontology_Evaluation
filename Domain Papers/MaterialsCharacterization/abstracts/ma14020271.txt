A homogenization-based five-step multi-scale finite element (FsMsFE) simulation framework is developed to describe the time-temperature-dependent viscoelastic behavior of 3D braided four-directional composites. The current analysis was performed via three-scale finite element models, the fiber/matrix (microscopic) representative unit cell (RUC) model, the yarn/matrix (mesoscopic) representative unit cell model, and the macroscopic solid model with homogeneous property. Coupling the time-temperature equivalence principle, multi-phase finite element approach, Laplace transformation and Prony series fitting technology, the character of the stress relaxation behaviors at three scales subject to variation in temperature is investigated, and the equivalent time-dependent thermal expansion coefficients (TTEC), the equivalent time-dependent thermal relaxation modulus (TTRM) under micro-scale and meso-scale were predicted. Furthermore, the impacts of temperature, structural parameters and relaxation time on the time-dependent thermo-viscoelastic properties of 3D braided four-directional composites were studied.
