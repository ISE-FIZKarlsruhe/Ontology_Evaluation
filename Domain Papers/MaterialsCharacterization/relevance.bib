ABSTRACT = {The main issue of wood is its sensitivity to Relative Humidity (RH) variations, affecting its dimensional stability, and thus leading to crack formations and propagations. In situ structural health monitoring campaigns imply the use of portable noninvasive techniques such as acoustic emission, used for real-time detection of energy released when cracks form and grow. This paper proposes a calibration method, i.e., acoustic emission, as an early warning tool for estimating the length of new formed cracks. The predictability of ductile and brittle fracture mechanisms based on acoustic emission features was investigated, as well as climate-induced damage effect, leading to a strain-hardening mechanism. Tensile tests were performed on specimens submitted to a 50% RH variation and coated with chemicals to limit moisture penetration through the radial surfaces. Samples were monitored for acoustic emission using a digital camera to individuate calibration curves that correlated the total emitted energy with the crack propagation, specifically during brittle fracture mechanism, since equations provide the energy to create a new surface as the crack propagates. The dynamic surface energy value was also evaluated and used to define a Locus of Equilibrium of the energy surface rate for crack initiation and arrest, as well as to experimentally demonstrate the proven fluctuation concept.},

ABSTRACT = {High-pressure synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction studies of smectite group minerals (beidellite, montmorillonite, and nontronite) reveal comparative volumetric changes in the presence of different fluids, as pressure transmitting media (PTM) of silicone oil and distilled water for anhydrous and hydrous environments at room temperature. Using silicone oil PTM, all minerals show gradual contraction of unit-cell volumes and atomistic interplane distances. They, however, show abrupt collapse near 1.0 GPa under distilled water conditions due to hydrostatic to quasi-hydrostatic environmental changes of water PTM around samples concomitant with the transition from liquid to ICE-VI and ICE-VII. The degrees of volume contractions of beidellite, montmorillonite, and nontronite up to ca. 3 GPa are ca. 6.6%, 8.9%, and 7.5% with bulk moduli of ca. 38(1) GPa, 31(2) GPa, and 26(1) GPa under silicone oil pressure, whereas 13(1) GPa, 13(2) GPa, and 17(2) GPa, and 17(1) GPa, 20(1) GPa, and 21(1) GPa under hydrostatic and quasi-hydrostatic environments before and after 1.50 GPa, respectively.},

ABSTRACT = {Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) remain one of the most promising materials of our times. One of the goals is to implement semiconducting and metallic SWCNTs in photonics and microelectronics, respectively. In this work, we demonstrated how such materials could be obtained from the parent material by using the aqueous two-phase extraction method (ATPE) at a large scale. We also developed a dedicated process on how to harvest the SWCNTs from the polymer matrices used to form the biphasic system. The technique is beneficial as it isolates SWCNTs with high purity while simultaneously maintaining their surface intact. To validate the utility of the metallic and semiconducting SWCNTs obtained this way, we transformed them into thin free-standing films and characterized their thermoelectric properties.},

ABSTRACT = {In the present paper, the identification of the material parameters of a masonry lighthouse is discussed. A fully non-invasive method was selected, in which the material properties were determined via numerical model validation applied to the first pair of natural frequencies and their related mode shapes, determined experimentally. The exact structural model was built by means of the finite element method. To obtain experimental data for the inverse analysis, operational modal analysis was applied to the structure. Three methods were considered: peak picking (PP), eigensystem realization algorithm (ERA) and natural excitation technique with ERA (NExT-ERA). The acceleration’s responses to environmental excitations, enhanced in some periods of time by sheet piling hammering or by sudden interruptions like wind stroke, were assumed within the analysis input. Different combinations of the input were considered in the PP and NExT-ERA analysis to find the most reasonable modal forms. A number of time periods of a free-decay character were considered in the ERA technique to finally calculate the averaged modal forms. Finally, the elastic modulus, Poisson’s ratio and material density of brick, sandstone and granite masonry were determined. The obtained values supplement the state of the art database concerning historic building materials. In addition, the numerical model obtained in the analysis may be used in further cases of structural analysis.},

ABSTRACT = {This study aimed to develop series analytical solutions based on the Mindlin plate theory for the free vibrations of functionally graded material (FGM) rectangular plates. The material properties of FGM rectangular plates are assumed to vary along their thickness, and the volume fractions of the plate constituents are defined by a simple power-law function. The series solutions consist of the Fourier cosine series and auxiliary functions of polynomials. The series solutions were established by satisfying governing equations and boundary conditions in the expanded space of the Fourier cosine series. The proposed solutions were validated through comprehensive convergence studies on the first six vibration frequencies of square plates under four combinations of boundary conditions and through comparison of the obtained convergent results with those in the literature. The convergence studies indicated that the solutions obtained for different modes could converge from the upper or lower bounds to the exact values or in an oscillatory manner. The present solutions were further employed to determine the first six vibration frequencies of FGM rectangular plates with various aspect ratios, thickness-to-width ratios, distributions of material properties and combinations of boundary conditions.},

ABSTRACT = {Some special conditions are important for chemical syntheses, such as high temperature and the medium used; unfortunately, uncontrollable influences are introduced during the process, resulting in unexpectedly low repeatability. Herein, we report a facile, environmentally friendly, stable, and repeatable methodology for synthesizing silver nanoplates (SNPs) at 0 °C that overcomes these issues and dramatically increases the yield. This method mainly employs sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and sodium alginate (SA) as the surface stabilizer and assistant, respectively. Consequently, we produced hexagonal nanoplates and tailed nanoplates, and the characterization showed that SA dominates the clear and regular profiles of nanoplates at 0 °C. The tailed nanoplates, over time, showed the growth of heads and the dissolving of tails, and inclined to the nanoplates without tails. The synthesis method for SNPs used in this study—0 °C without media—showed high repeatability. We confirmed that these special conditions are not required for the synthesis of silver nanostructures (SNSs). Furthermore, we constructed a new method for preparing noble metal nanostructures and proved the possibility of preparing metal nanostructures at 0 °C.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper presents a method based on signal correlation to detect delamination defects of widely used carbon fiber reinforced plastic with high precision and a convenient process. The objective of it consists in distinguishing defect and non-defect signals and presenting the depth and size of defects by image. A necessary reference signal is generated from the non-defect area by using autocorrelation theory firstly. Through the correlation calculation results, the defect signal and non-defect signal are distinguished by using Euclidean distance. In order to get more accurate time-of-flight, cubic spline interpolation is introduced. In practical automatic ultrasonic A-scan signal processing, signal correlation provide a new way to avoid problems such as signal peak tracking and complex gate setting. Finally, the detection results of a carbon fiber laminate with artificial delamination through ultrasonic phased array C-scan acquired from Olympus OmniScan MX2 and this proposed algorithm are compared, which showing that this proposed algorithm performs well in defect shape presentation and location calculation. The experiment shows that the defect size error is less than 4%, the depth error less than 3%. Compared with ultrasonic C-scan method, this proposed method needs less inspector’s prior-knowledge, which can lead to advantages in automatic ultrasonic testing.},

ABSTRACT = {Wrinkles attract significant attention due to their ability to enhance the mechanical and optical characteristics of various optoelectronic devices. We report the effect of the plasma gas type, power, flow rate, and treatment time on the wrinkle features. When an optical adhesive was treated using a low-pressure plasma of oxygen, argon, and nitrogen, the oxygen and argon plasma generated wrinkles with the lowest and highest wavelengths, respectively. The increase in the power of the nitrogen and oxygen plasma increased the wavelengths and heights of the wrinkles; however, the increase in the power of the argon plasma increased the wavelengths and decreased the heights of the wrinkles. Argon molecules are heavier and smaller than nitrogen and oxygen molecules that have similar weights and sizes; moreover, the argon plasma comprises positive ions while the oxygen and nitrogen plasma comprise negative ions. This resulted in differences in the wrinkle features. It was concluded that a combination of different plasma gases could achieve exclusive control over either the wavelength or the height and allow a thorough analysis of the correlation between the wrinkle features and the characteristics of the electronic devices.},

ABSTRACT = {The paper presents the optimisation of thin-walled composite structures on a representative sample of a thin-walled column made of carbon laminate with a channel section-type profile. The optimisation consisted of determining the configuration of laminate layers for which the tested structure has the greatest resistance to the loss of stability. The optimisation of the layer configuration was performed using two methods. The first method, divided into two stages to reduce the time, was to determine the optimum arrangement angle in each laminate layer using finite element methods (FEM). The second method employed artificial neural networks for predicting critical buckling force values and the creation of an optimisation tool. Artificial neural networks were combined into groups of networks, thereby improving the quality of the obtained results and simplifying the obtained neural networks. The results from computations were verified against the results obtained from the experiment. The optimisation was performed using ABAQUS® and STATISTICA® software.},

ABSTRACT = {The effect of the layer sequence on the ballistic performance of Ti6Al4V (35 mm)/CP-Ti (5 mm) laminated composite armor, against a 12.7 mm armor piercing projectile, was systematically investigated, both experimentally and computationally. By introducing the Johnson–Cook constitutive model and fracture criterion, the penetrating process of the composite plate was well-simulated. Furthermore, the influence of the layer sequence on the ballistic performance and failure mechanism of the composite plate was evaluated from the perspective of energy absorption and the stress distribution. Numerical simulation results of the macro morphology and penetration depth agreed well with the experimental results. The results showed that the energy absorption histories of each layer and stress distribution of the composite plate were found to be significantly affected by the arrangement sequence. The ballistic performance of Ti6Al4V/CP-Ti was far superior to that of CP-Ti/Ti6Al4V because more energy was absorbed in the early stage of the penetration process, thereby reducing the damage to the rear face. Further studies showed that the first principal stress in both structures was radially distributed in space, but was mainly concentrated at the rear face when the CP-Ti was placed at the front. Therefore, this stress induced cracking and failure in that region and, consequently, lowered the overall ballistic performance.},

ABSTRACT = {Calcium sulfide (CaS) inclusion with large and irregular shape is detrimental to the properties of steel. Understanding the shape and distribution of CaS inclusions in a continuous casting (CC) slab is of significance for improving the rolling properties. In this study, CaS inclusions were extracted from CC slab of Ni20Mn6 steel using the electrolytic extraction and investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM)-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). The CaS inclusions morphologies vary with their locations in the CC slab and, thus, are classified into five categories. The thermodynamics calculated results showed that CaS inclusions precipitated at the end of solidification due to the microsegregation of sulfur and calcium in the interdendrite liquid and finally precipitated along the austenite grain boundary. The macrosegregation degree of solutes in different regions is one of the reasons that affect the size of CaS inclusion. The morphologies of CaS inclusion are affected by the solidification structure of slab and austenite grain boundary.},

ABSTRACT = {An original vision for the structural formation of (Sm,Zr)(Co,Cu,Fe)Z alloys, the compositions of which show promise for manufacturing high-coercivity permanent magnets, is reported. Foundations arising from the quantitative analysis of alloy microstructures as the first, coarse, level of heterogeneity are considered. The structure of the alloys, in optical resolutions, is shown to be characterized by three structural phase components, which are denoted as A, B, and C and based on the 1:5, 2:17, and 2:7 phases, respectively. As the chemical composition of alloys changes monotonically, the quantitative relationships of the components A, B, and C vary over wide ranges. In this case, the hysteretic properties of the (Sm,Zr)(Co,Cu,Fe)Z alloys in the high-coercivity state are strictly controlled by the volume fractions of the A and B structural components. Based on quantitative relationships of the A, B, and C structural components for the (R,Zr)(Co,Cu,Fe)Z alloys with R = Gd or Sm, sketches of quasi-ternary sections of the (Co,Cu,Fe)-R-Zr phase diagrams at temperatures of 1160–1190 °C and isopleths for the 2:17–2:7 phase composition range of the (Co,Cu,Fe)–Sm–Zr system were constructed.},

ABSTRACT = {Long-term cyclic loading is observed in a wide range of human activities, as well as in nature, such as in the case of ocean waves. Cyclic loading can lead to ratcheting which is defined as progressive accumulation of plastic deformation in a material. Long-term cyclic loading causes a time effect (creep), which is a secondary compression effect. In this article, we conducted 15 triaxial tests on four types of cohesive materials in undrained conditions to evaluate the damage and failure mechanism. To characterize the strain and pore pressure development, we modified the Yanbu resistance concept. On the basis of the static creep tests, we concluded that the stress paths for undrained creep behavior have to take into account the pore pressure developed during long-term cyclic loading. Pore pressure build-up and plastic strain accumulation during long-term cyclic loading are dependent on the number of loading cycles. Finally, we proposed the failure criterion, which was based on the Modified Cam-Clay constitutive model.},

ABSTRACT = {Conventional slit dampers are widely used for the purpose of seismic retrofitting, however, the structure of these dampers is susceptible to fractures, due to stress concentration at the ends of the strips in the event of large earthquakes. To address this issue, a novel radius-cut coke-shaped strip damper featuring improved ductility is proposed herein. This damper was developed based on the moment distribution over the strip when both its ends were constrained. The height-to-width ratio of the strip was increased to induce bending rather than shear deformation, and the reduced beam section method was employed. A radius-cut section was used to intentionally focus the stress to induce the plastic hinge. This reduced the fracture fragility of the specimen, resulting in an increased inelastic deformation capacity. Cyclic loading tests were conducted to verify damping performance against earthquakes. Experiments and finite element analyses proved that the coke-shaped damper exhibits improved ductility. The final fracture occurred in the radius-cut section after sufficient energy dissipation during cyclic loading. The results also indicated further improvements in strength due to the membrane effect under cyclic loading, caused by the tensile resistance of the strip due to its constrained ends.},

ABSTRACT = {In this work, which is part of a larger research program, a framework called “virtual data fusion” was developed to provide an automated and consistent crack detection method that allows for the cross-comparison of results from large quantities of X-ray computed tomography (CT) data. A partial implementation of this method in a custom program was developed for use in research focused on crack quantification in alkali-silica reaction (ASR)-sensitive concrete aggregates. During the CT image processing, a series of image analyses tailored for detecting specific, individual crack-like characteristics were completed. The results of these analyses were then “fused” in order to identify crack-like objects within the images with much higher accuracy than that yielded by any individual image analysis procedure. The results of this strategy demonstrated the success of the program in effectively identifying crack-like structures and quantifying characteristics, such as surface area and volume. The results demonstrated that the source of aggregate has a very significant impact on the amount of internal cracking, even when the mineralogical characteristics remain very similar. River gravels, for instance, were found to contain significantly higher levels of internal cracking than quarried stone aggregates of the same mineralogical type.},

ABSTRACT = {Young’s modulus (E) is one of the most important parameters in the mechanical properties of solid materials. Young’s modulus is proportional to the stress and strain values. There are several experimental and theoretical methods for gaining Young’s modulus values, such as stress–strain curves in compression and tensile tests, electromagnetic-acoustic resonance, ultrasonic pulse echo and density functional theory (DFT) in different basis sets. Apparently, preparing specimens for measuring Young’s modulus through the experimental methods is not convenient and it is time-consuming. In addition, for calculating Young’s modulus values by software, presumptions of data and structures are needed. Therefore, this new method for gaining the Young’s modulus values of crystalline materials is presented. Herein, the new method for calculating Young’s modulus of crystalline materials is extracted by X-ray diffraction. In this study, Young’s modulus values were gained through the arbitrary planes such as random (hkl) in the research. In this study, calculation of Young’s modulus through the relationship between elastic compliances, geometry of the crystal lattice and the planar density of each plane is obtained by X-ray diffraction. Sodium chloride (NaCl) with crystal lattices of FCC was selected as the example. The X-ray diffraction, elastic stiffness constant and elastic compliances values have been chosen by the X’Pert software, literature and experimental measurements, respectively. The elastic stiffness constant and Young’s modulus of NaCl were measured by the ultrasonic technique and, finally, the results were in good agreement with the new method of this study. The aim of the modified Williamson–Hall (W–H) method in the uniform stress deformation model (USDM) utilized in this paper is to provide a new approach of using the W–H equation, so that a least squares technique can be applied to minimize the sources of errors.},

ABSTRACT = {Silica has many industrial (i.e., glass formers) and scientific applications. The understanding and prediction of the interesting properties of such materials are dependent on the knowledge of detailed atomic structures. In this work, amorphous silica subjected to an accelerated alkali silica reaction (ASR) was recorded at different time intervals so as to follow the evolution of the structure by means of high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), and electron pair distribution function (e-PDF), combined with X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD). An increase in the size of the amorphous silica nanostructures and nanopores was observed by HRTEM, which was accompanied by the possible formation of Si–OH surface species. All of the studied samples were found to be amorphous, as observed by HRTEM, a fact that was also confirmed by XRPD and e-PDF analysis. A broad diffuse peak observed in the XRPD pattern showed a shift toward higher angles following the higher reaction times of the ASR-treated material. A comparison of the EELS spectra revealed varying spectral features in the peak edges with different reaction times due to the interaction evolution between oxygen and the silicon and OH ions. Solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) was also used to elucidate the silica nanostructures.},

In this work, its environmental compatibility was investigated. The focus of this research was the leaching behavior of C3, especially for the application as irrigated façade elements. Laboratory and outdoor exposure tests were run to determine and assess the heavy metal and trace element emissions. In the wake of this work, the validity of laboratory experiments and the transferability to outdoor behavior were investigated. The experimental results show very low releases of environmental harmful substances from carbon concrete composite. Most heavy metal concentrations were in the range of <0.1–8 µg/L, and higher concentrations (up to 32 µg/L) were found for barium, chromium, and copper. Vanadium and zinc concentrations were in the range of 0.1–60 µg/L, boron and nickel concentrations were clearly exceeding 100 µg/L. Most of the high concentrations were found to be a result of the rainfall background concentrations. The material C3 is therefore considered to be environmentally friendly. There is no general correlation between laboratory leaching data and outdoor emissions. The results depend on the examined substance and used method. The prediction and evaluation of the leaching of building elements submitted to rain is therefore challenging. This topic is debated in the second part of this publication.},

ABSTRACT = {New polycrystalline SrMo1−xMxO4−δ (M = Fe and Cr) scheelite oxides have been prepared by topotactical oxidation, by annealing in air at 500 °C, from precursor perovskites with the stoichiometry SrMo1−xMxO3−δ (M = Fe and Cr). An excellent reversibility between the oxidized Sr(Mo,M)O4−δ scheelite and the reduced Sr(Mo,M)O3−δ perovskite phase accounts for the excellent behavior of the latter as anode material in solid-oxide fuel cells. A characterization by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and neutron powder diffraction (NPD) has been carried out to determine the crystal structure features. The scheelite oxides are tetragonal, space group I41/a (No. 88). The Rietveld-refinement from NPD data at room temperature shows evidence of oxygen vacancies in the structure, due to the introduction of Fe3+/Cr4+ cations in the tetrahedrally-coordinated B sublattice, where Mo is hexavalent. A thermal analysis of the reduced perovskite (SrMo1−xMxO3−δ) in oxidizing conditions confirms the oxygen stoichiometry obtained by NPD data; the stability range of the doped oxides, below 400–450 °C, is lower than that for the parent SrMoO3 oxide. The presence of a Mo4+/Mo5+ mixed valence in the reduced SrMo1−xMxO3−δ perovskite oxides confers greater instability against oxidation compared with the parent oxide. Finally, an XPS study confirms the surface oxidation states of Mo, Fe, and Cr in the oxidized samples SrMo0.9Fe0.1O4-δ and SrMo0.8Cr0.2O4-δ.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper presents the results of martensite tempering resistance in 4% Mn steel. The material was quenched and tempered at 350 °C for 15, 30, and 60 min. The analysis of the quenching and tempering was carried out using dilatometric and microstructural approaches. The phase composition was assessed using X-ray diffraction. The Ms temperature and tempering progress were simulated using JMatPro software. The dilatometric analysis revealed a small decrease in the relative change in length (RCL) during tempering. This decrease was connected to the precipitation kinetics of cementite within the martensite laths. The microstructure investigation using a scanning electron microscope showed a very small amount of carbides, even for the longest tempering time. This showed the high tempering resistance of the martensite in medium-Mn steels. The hardness results showed an insignificant decrease in the hardness depending on the tempering time, which confirmed the high tempering resistance of martensite.},

ABSTRACT = {The most economically important iron-chromium bearing minerals is chromite. In natural deposits, iron(II) is frequently substituted by magnesium(II) while chromium(III) is replaced by aluminum(III) and/or iron(III) forming a complex chromium bearing material. The majority of mined chromite is intended for the production of ferrochrome which requires a chromite concentrate with high chromium-to-iron ratio. Found mostly in the spinel chromite structure, iron cannot be removed by physical mineral processing methods. In this frame, the present work deals with the reaction of chlorine and chlorine+oxygen with selected samples of chromite concentrates for assessing the reactivity of their components towards chlorinating atmosphere, allowing the preferential removal of iron, hence meeting the chromite metallurgical grade requirements. Isothermal thermogravimetric analysis was used as a reliable approach for the kinetic reactivity investigation. Results indicated a wide difference in the thermal behavior of chromite constituents in a chlorinating atmosphere when considering their respective values of apparent activation energy oscillating from about 60 to 300 kJ/mol as a function of the sample reacted fraction. During the chromite treatment by chlorine in presence of oxygen, chromium was recovered as liquid chromyl chloride by condensation of the reaction gas phase.},

ABSTRACT = {The work presents a comprehensive vibrational analysis of the process of adsorption of threonine (Thr) onto an Fe surface with deposited Cu nanoparticles (NPs) (of about 4–5 nm in size) in a corrosive environment. The application of surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) and surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (SEIRA) provides the opportunity for detailed description of adsorption geometry of amino acid onto a metal surface. The combination of conventional infrared spectroscopy (IR) with atomic force microscopy (AFM) resulted in a nano-SEIRA technique which made it possible to provide a precise description of adsorbate binding to the metal surface. The studies presented confirmed that there is a very good correlation between the spectra recorded by the SERS, SEIRA, and nano-SEIRA techniques. Threonine significantly influenced the process of corrosion of the investigated surface due to the existing strong interaction between the protonated amine and carboxylate groups and the CuNPs deposited onto the Fe surface. In addition, the application of two polarization modulations (s and p) in nano-SEIRA allows subtle changes to be observed in the molecule geometry upon adsorption, with the carboxylate group of Thr being almost horizontally oriented onto the metal surface; whereas the amine group that contains nitrogen is oriented perpendicular to this surface.},

ABSTRACT = {Arc beads are high-temperature luminous electric discharges that form across a gap between two bodies, which is one of the vital forensic pieces of evidence for the evaluation of electrical fires. In this study, based on an actual electrical fire, the microstructure of arc beads from a copper wire that experienced an overcurrent fault was investigated by optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Moreover, the effects of the overcurrent intensity on the grain morphology, trace elements, and microstructure of the arc beads were analyzed. The results showed that the simulated metallographic structure of the arc beads is mainly dendrite at four times the rated current, which is consistent with the fire scene. With an increase in the overcurrent, the average diameter, perimeter, and area of the grains increased, while the dendrite growth was inhibited by the overcurrent. In addition, the main trace elements were Cu, C, O, and Cl. When the current increased, the Cu content gradually decreased and tended to be stable, while the C content gradually increased. The conclusion of this research provided a scientific reference for identifying the melting trace in a copper conductor under overcurrent fault.},

ABSTRACT = {Constant tendency toward the improvement of the material properties nowadays creates opportunities for the scientists all over the world to design and manufacture new alloys almost every day. Considering the fact that companies all over the world desire alloys with the highest values of mechanical properties often coexisting with a reasonable electrical conductivity made it necessary to develop new materials based on Cu, such as CuMg alloys. However, before such new material may be mass produced it must undergo a series of tests in order to determine the production technology, its parameters and influence on the chemical composition, microstructural properties, and both mechanical and physical properties of CuMg alloys. The research tests have shown that with the increase of the casting feed the Brinell’s hardness of each material slightly increases (by 5 HB2.5/62.5). There is little to none impact of the casting feed on the electrical conductivity, values of which are between 20.6 and 21.4 MS/m (around 40% IACS-International Annealed Copper Standard) depending on the Mg content. The conducted scanning electron microstopy (SEM) analysis has shown that the magnesium precipitations are evenly distributed among the volume of the alloy, however, a significant difference in the density and shape of the Cu + Cu2Mg aggregates was noticed regarding various casting feed. Static compression test proved that these alloys may be subjected to strain hardening as the hardness of the material after compression increases by approximately 40 HB2.5/62.5.},

ABSTRACT = {TiMoZrTaSi alloys appertain to a new generation of metallic biomaterials, labeled high-entropy alloys, that assure both biocompatibility as well as improved mechanical properties required by further medical applications. This paper presents the use of nondestructive evaluation techniques for new type of alloys, TiMo20Zr7Ta15Six, with x = 0; 0.5; 0.75; 1.0, which were obtained by vacuum melting. In Ti alloys, the addition of Mo improves tensile creep strength, Si improves both the creep and oxidation properties, Zr leads to an α crystalline structure, which increases the mechanical strength and assures a good electrochemical behavior, and Ta is a β stabilizer sustaining the formation of solid β-phases and contributes to tensile strength improvement and Young modulus decreasing. The effects of Si content on the mechanical properties of the studied alloys and the effect of the addition of Ta and Zr under the presence of Si on the evolution of crystallographic structure was studied. The influence of composition on fracture behavior and strength was evaluated using X-ray diffraction, resonant ultrasound spectroscopy (RUS) analyses, SEM with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and acoustic emission (AE) within compression tests. The β-type TiMo20Zr7Ta15Six alloys had a good compression strength of over 800 MPa, lower Young modulus (69.11–89.03 GPa) and shear modulus (24.70–31.87 GPa), all offering advantages for use in medical applications.},

ABSTRACT = {The use of anticorrosive coatings has been a powerful method to be applied on the surface of metallic materials to mitigate the corrosive process. In this study, the focus is composite coatings that are commonly used on the internal surface of storage tanks in petrochemical industries. The development of non-destructive methods for inspection of faults in this field is desired due to unhealthy access and mainly because undercoating corrosion is difficult to detect by visual inspection. Pulsed thermography (PT) was employed to detect undercoating corrosion and adhesion loss of anticorrosive composite coatings defects. Additionally, a computational simulation model was developed to complement the PT tests. According to the experimental results, PT was able to detect all types of defects evaluated. The results obtained by computational simulation were compared with experimental ones. Good correlation (similarity) was verified, regarding both the defect detection and thermal behavior, validating the developed model. Additionally, by reconstructing the thermal behavior according to the defect parameters evaluated in the study, it was estimated the limit of the remaining thickness of the defect for which it would be possible to obtain its detection using the pulsed modality.},

ABSTRACT = {The main purpose of this paper is to propose, based on the literature review, a new multiaxial fatigue strain criterion, analogous to the Dang Van stress criterion, considering the maximum amplitude of the shear strain and volumetric strain. The proposed strain criterion was successfully verified by fatigue tests in cyclic bending with torsion of specimens made of 2017A-T4 and 6082-T6 aluminum alloy. The scatter of test results for cyclic bending and the combination of cyclic bending and torsion is included in the scatter of tests for the cyclic torsion of the analyzed materials. Fracture surfaces for respective bending and torsion in the 6082-T6 aluminum test with strain control showed that, in the case of bending, cracks can be observed that develop from the surface of the specimen towards the bending plane. They are inclined from the fatigue crack at an angle of 45° in relation to the crack surface and the remaining cracks come from the static fracture. In the case of torsion, however, a conical fracture at 45° and a static torsion zone can be observed.},

The numerical analysis was performed using Abaqus 6.14 software. The specific aim of the study was to determine the extent to which variable wall thickness affects the energy absorption capacity of the components under study. From the simulations, we have managed to establish a relationship between total energy absorption capacity and wall thickness. The results from the conducted analyses and the purpose-specific neural networks could provide the base for the future methodology for forecasting and optimisation of energy-absorbing systems.},

ABSTRACT = {While it is accepted that the plastic behavior of metallic glasses is affected by their free volume content, the effect on chemical bonding has not been investigated systematically. According to electronic structure analysis, the overall bond strength is not significantly affected by the free volume content. However, with an increasing free volume content, the average coordination number decreases. Furthermore, the volume fraction of regions containing atoms with a lower coordination number increases. As the local bonding character changes from bonding to anti-bonding with a decreasing coordination number, bonding is weakened in the volume fraction of a lower coordination number. During deformation, the number of strong, short-distance bonds decreases more for free volume-containing samples than for samples without free volume, resulting in additional bond weakening. Therefore, we show that the introduction of free volume causes the formation of volume fractions of a lower coordination number, resulting in weaker bonding, and propose that this is the electronic structure origin of the enhanced plastic behavior reported for glasses containing free volume.},

ABSTRACT = {In this study, the processing of SiC particulate-strengthened magnesium alloy metal matrix composites via vacuum supported inert atmosphere stir casting process is presented. The effects of small variations in the SiC particulate (average size 20 µm) reinforcement in magnesium alloy AZ91 were examined. It was found that with the addition of SiC particulate reinforcement, the hardness improved considerably, while the ultimate tensile and yield strength improved slightly. The density and porosity of the magnesium alloy-based composites increased with the increase in the wt.% of SiC particulates. The tensile and compressive fracture study of the fabricated composites was also performed. The tensile fractures were shown to be mixed-mode fractures (i.e., ductile and cleavage). The fractured surface also disclosed tiny dimples, micro-crack, and cleavage fractures which increases with increasing reinforcement. For the compression fracture, the surface microstructural studies of AZ91 displayed major shear failure and demonstrated the greater shear bands when compared to AZ91/SiC composites, which instead revealed rough fracture surfaces with mixed-mode brittle and shear features.},

ABSTRACT = {Reciprocating Upsetting-Extrusion (RUE) deformation process can significantly refine the grains size and weaken the basal plane texture by applying a large cumulative strain to the alloy, which is of great significance to weaken the anisotropy of magnesium (Mg) alloys and increase the application range. In this paper, the Mg-8.27Gd-3.18Y-0.43Zr (wt %) alloy was subjected to isothermal multi-passes RUE. The microstructure and texture evolution, crystal orientation-dependent deformation mechanism of the alloy after deformation were investigated. The results clearly show that with the increase of RUE process, the grains are significantly refined through continuous dynamic recrystallization (CDRX) and discontinuous dynamic recrystallization (DDRX) mechanisms, the uniformity of the microstructure is improved, and the texture intensity is reduced. At the same time, a large number of particle phases are dynamically precipitated during the deformation process, promoting grain refinement by the particle-stimulated nucleation (PSN) mechanism. The typical [10-10] fiber texture is produced after one pass due to the basal plane of the deformed grains with a relatively high proportion is gradually parallel to the ED during extrusion process. However, the texture concentration is reduced compared with the traditional extrusion deformation, indicating that the upsetting deformation has a certain delay effect on the subsequent extrusion texture generation. After three or four passes deformation, the grain orientation is randomized due to the continuous progress of the dynamic recrystallization process.},

ABSTRACT = {Possible threats on the environment and human health by the leaching of new building materials and composites in contact to water should be prevented from the outset. It is therefore necessary to assess and ensure their environmental compatibility. For irrigated construction elements this is a challenging task, as there is no general correlation between known testing methods and outdoor emissions. A feasible assessment concept is needed for these conditions. In this work the German assessment method for permanently wet building materials is applied on different carbon reinforced concrete (C3) leaching data. Furthermore, emission prediction approaches of the Dutch building Materials Decree and the software COMLEAM are tested. The established methods are not yet suitable to determine the complex long term outdoor emissions of irrigated C3. In order to achieve realistic results in time saving testing methods and to define reasonable release limits, it is necessary to determine and verify the relevant influencing parameters on leaching through intermittent water contact. This research works out leaching patterns and correlations between inorganic substances. It is shown that the input parameters time of exposure, contact time, air temperature, air humidity, runoff and background concentration should be considered to predict the leaching processes from irrigated concrete phenomenologically.},

ABSTRACT = {The Mg–0.6Al–20.8Gd (wt.%) alloys were homogenized at 620 °C for 20 min under 0 T and 1 T, followed by furnace cooling, quenching, and air cooling, respectively. The effects of the magnetic field on the phase constituent, microstructure, secondary phase precipitation, and mechanical properties of the Mg–Al–Gd alloys were investigated. The Mg–Al–Gd alloys contained α-Mg, Mg5Gd, Al2Gd, and GdH2 phases, and the phase constituents were hardly influenced by the applied magnetic field. However, the precipitation of the paramagnetic Mg5Gd upon cooling was accelerated by the magnetic field, and that of the ferromagnetic Al2Gd phases was inhibited. In addition, the Al2Gd phase was significantly refined and driven to segregate at the grain boundaries by the magnetic field, and the resultant pinning effect led to the microstructure change from dendritic α-Mg grains to rosette-like ones. When the magnetic field was only applied to the homogenization stage, the content of the Mg5Gd phase remained unchanged in the quenched alloy, whereas the Mg5Gd laths were significantly refined. By contrast, the contents of the Al2Gd and GdH2 phases were increased, while the precipitation sites were still within the α-Mg grains. The Mg5Gd laths were incapable of providing precipitation strengthening, while the Al2Gd and GdH2 particles brought positive effects on the enhancement of the mechanical properties. In the quenching condition, the hardness, compression strength, and ductility can be improved by the magnetic treatment, whereas these mechanical properties can be suppressed in the furnace cooled condition by the magnetic treatment.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper explores the joining of materials by a new progressive method of thermal drilling. Many types of joints are utilized in industrial production, especially in the automotive industry, which requires the joining of different types of materials with different thicknesses. For these needs, it will be appropriate to apply the joining method of thermal drilling technology. The used material, its mechanical properties, and the preparation of the joint by assembly and disassembly operations play an equally important role. By using new friction technologies, we can reduce production time, increase joint quality, offer automation in certain types of operations, save economic costs, and protect the environment. In this contribution, the authors present the results of their scientific research work focused on an investigation, comparison and testing of thermal drilling effects on the behavior of aluminum alloys (AlMgSi). The holes, collars and bushings formed by the drilling method were subjected to visual shape evaluation. Based on the evaluation of the samples, the quality of the evaluated joints was assessed. The best shape and strength properties at higher speeds of the drilling machine were obtained at 3400 rpm. The results of the methods of macroscopy and microscopy investigations, as well as the results of the methods of scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray (EDS), are presented in this contribution.},

ABSTRACT = {As the raw material for the production of basalt continuous fibers in Sichuan, basalt glass (BG) and modified basalt glass (MBG) were prepared by the melt quenching method with the basalt and chemically modified basalt, respectively. The crystallization kinetics of BG and MBG were investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) according to Kissinger methods. The results revealed that it is difficult for both glasses to crystallize at a high temperature. In addition, the crystallization activation energy of MBG is much higher than that of BG, which indicates that MBG is more difficult to crystallize than BG. The crystalline phases seemed to be formed from the surface of the two glasses. The morphologies and crystal structure of the crystalline phases in the heat-treated BG and MBG were analyzed by scanning electron microscope (SEM/EDX) and XRD. It was found that only a small amount of crystalline phase can be observed in the MBG, which indicates that the crystallization ability of the MBG was greatly suppressed. Results of this initial investigation indicate that chemical modification can effectively suppress the crystallization tendency of basalt glass and improve its thermal stability, which opens up an effective way for the industrial scale and stable production of basalt fiber.},

ABSTRACT = {Absorbents used in closed and semi-closed circuit environments play a key role in preventing carbon dioxide poisoning. Here we present an analysis of one of the most common carbon dioxide absorbents—soda lime. In the first step, we analyzed the composition of fresh and used samples. For this purpose, volumetric and photometric analyses were introduced. Thermal properties and decomposition patterns were also studied using thermogravimetric and X-ray powder diffraction (PXRD) analyses. We also investigated the kinetics of carbon dioxide absorption under conditions imitating a closed-circuit environment.},

ABSTRACT = {Martensitic steels are tempered to increase the toughness of the metastable martensite, which is brittle in the as-quenched state, and to achieve a more stable microstructure. During the tempering of steels, several particular overlapping effects can arise. Classical dilatometric investigations can only detect effects by monitoring the integral length change of the sample. Additional in-situ diffractometry allowed a differentiation of the individual effects such as transformation of retained austenite and formation of cementite during tempering. Additionally, the lattice parameters of martensite and therefrom the tetragonality was analyzed. Two low-alloy steels with carbon contents of 0.4 and 1.0 wt.% and a high-alloy 5Cr-1Mo-steel with 0.4 wt.% carbon were investigated by dilatometry and in-situ diffractometry. In this paper, microstructural effects during tempering of the investigated steels are discussed by a comparative study of dilatometric and diffractometric experiments. The influence of the chemical composition on the tempering behavior is illustrated by comparing the determined effects of the three steels. The kinetics of tempering is similar for the low-alloy steels and shifted to much higher temperatures for the high-alloy steel. During tempering, the tetragonality of martensite in the steel with 1.0 wt% carbon shifts towards a low carbon behavior, as in the steels with 0.4 wt.% carbon.},

ABSTRACT = {In the present paper, aspects concerning the obtained and characterization of additive systems used for maximizing filler retention, and the effects on paper properties, were investigated. The effects of retention additives over properties of paper, containing fibers from in-situ loading (IS-CCP), were analyzed against the effects of additives over properties of paper containing fibers from conventional loading, obtained by the addition of calcium carbonate in precipitated form (CCP). The physico-mechanical properties were analyzed by various analyses and investigations: calcium carbonate content, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images, optical and mechanical properties, in order to develop the best systems of retention additives for obtaining higher retention loads for making paper with high content of nano-filler material. The obtained results reveal that at the same level of calcium carbonate content, all paper samples with in-situ loading had higher the optical and mechanical properties than the paper obtained by conventional loading in all cases the additives studied. For all studied properties, nanoparticles had a positively influence over paper properties.},

ABSTRACT = {The present paper evaluates the misalignment and geometry distortion of the standard National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) test artifact in Inconel 718 alloy, when several layers with and without supports are employed to manufacture it by the Selective Laser Melting (SLM) process. To this end, a coordinate-measuring machine (CMM) is used to measure the geometrical distortion in each manufacturing configuration, following the same measurement protocol. The results show that the laser path strategy favors a thermal gradient which, consequently, induces geometrical distortions in the part. To prove this hypothesis, a numerical simulation is performed to determine the thermal gradient and the pattern of the residual stresses. It was found that the geometrical distortion certainly depends on the position of the feature position and laser strategy, where thermal cycles and residual thermal stresses had an impact in the end-part geometry, especially if a high strength-to-weight ratio commonly used in aeronautics is present.},

ABSTRACT = {The thermal stability of the Al-Si alloys during the thermal exposure process from 250 °C to 400 °C was systematically investigated. The relationships between the morphological evolution and the mechanical changes of the alloys were determined through the Vickers hardness test and materials characterization method. Initially, the alloys exhibited similar thermal degradation behavior. For example, the exposure process of the alloy at 300 °C can be divided into two stages according to the changes of the alloy hardness and the matrix micro-hardness. In detail, the first stage (0–2 h) exhibited a severe reduction of the alloy hardness while the second stage showed a more leveled hardness during the following 98 h. There are three identified morphological characteristics of Ni-rich phases in the alloy. Furthermore, the differences in both composition and the micro-hardness between these Ni-rich phases were confirmed. The underlying relationships between the morphological transformation of the Ni-rich phases and hardness fluctuation in the alloy were correlated and elucidated. The observed alloy hardness increase when the exposure temperature was 400 °C was unexpected. This behavior was explained from the perspectives of both Ni-rich phases evolution and dispersoid formation.},

ABSTRACT = {The paper presents the results of dynamic testing of two wood species: lime-tree (Tilia europoea) and pine (Pinaceae). The dynamic compressive tests were carried out using the traditional Kolsky method in compression tests. The Kolsky method was modified for testing the specimen in a rigid limiting holder. In the first case, stress–strain diagrams for uniaxial stress state were obtained, while in the second, for uniaxial deformation. To create the load a gas gun was used. According to the results of the experiments, dynamic stress–strain diagrams were obtained. The limiting strength and deformation characteristics were determined. The fracture energy of lime and pine depending on the type of test was also obtained. The strain rates and stress growth rates were determined. The influence of the cutting angle of the specimens relative to the grain was noted. Based on the results obtained, the necessary parameters of the wood model were determined and their adequacy was assessed by using a special verification experiment.},

Special attention was drawn to membrane components of transverse forces, which are expressed with the same formulas for the first three theories and do not depend on membrane deformations. These components are nonlinearly dependent on the plate deflection. The magnitudes of components of transverse forces for the four theories under consideration were compared.},

ABSTRACT = {The phase transformation to ausferrite during austempered ductile iron (ADI) heat treatment can be significantly influenced by the alloying element Mo. Utilizing neutron diffraction, the phase transformation from austenite to ausferrite was monitored in-situ during the heat treatment. In addition to the phase volume fractions, the carbon enrichment of retained austenite was investigated. The results from neutron diffraction were compared to the macroscopic length change from dilatometer measurements. They show that the dilatometer data are only of limited use for the investigation of ausferrite formation. However, they allow deriving the time of maximum carbon accumulation in the retained austenite. In addition, the transformation of austenite during ausferritization was investigated using metallographic methods. Finally, the distribution of the alloying elements in the vicinity of the austenite/ferrite interface zone was shown by atom probe tomography (APT) measurements. C and Mn were enriched within the interface, while Si concentration was reduced. The Mo concentration in ferrite, interface and austentite stayed at the same level. The delay of austenite decay during Stage II reaction caused by Mo was studied in detail at 400 °C for the initial material as well as for 0.25 mass % and 0.50 mass % Mo additions.},

ABSTRACT = {The influence of elevated deformation temperatures on the relationships between the microstructure and mechanical properties in a hot-rolled Si-Al-alloyed transformation-induced plasticity (TRIP)-aided steel was studied in a static tensile test. The morphological features of specimens deformed at the different temperatures were characterized by different microstructural techniques: optical microscopy (OM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). An increase in the deformation temperature from 20 to 200 °C resulted in the reduced effectiveness of the TRIP effect, due to the increasing mechanical stability of the γ phase. The gradual transformation of retained austenite into martensite expressed by a progressive increase in the work hardening exponent (n) led to a beneficial balance of strength, uniform elongation and total elongation. The best product of UTS × TEl = 17,805 MPa% showed the sample deformed at 20 °C with a peak n value amounting to 0.3.},

ABSTRACT = {In this work, friction stir lap welding (FSLW) and ultrasonic-assisted friction stir lap welding (UAFSLW) was applied to 6-mm-thick 7075-T6 alloy sheets using three welding tools with the same process parameters. The joint formation, microstructural characteristics, and mechanical properties of the resulting lap joints were then investigated. The results showed that ultrasonic vibration significantly promoted the flow of metal at the interface, enlarged the size of the stirred zone (SZ), and reduced the angle between the hook defect and the interface. During lap shear testing, the FSLW and UAFSLW joints fractured in a similar manner. The fracture modes included tensile fracture, shear fracture, and a mixture of both. Cold lap and hook defects may have served as crack-initiation zones within the joint. Under configuration A (i.e., upper sheet on the retreating side (RS)), all joints failed in the shear-fracture mode. The effective lap width (ELW) of the joint welded using tool T2 was the greatest. This resulted in a higher shear fracture strength. The maximum shear fracture strength of the UAFSLW joint was 663.1 N/mm. Under configuration B (i.e., upper sheet on the advancing side (AS)), the shear fracture strength was greatly affected by the fracture mode. The highest shear fracture strength of the UAFSLW joint, 543.7 N/mm, was welded by tool T3. Thus, under otherwise identical conditions, UAFSLW joints can withstand a greater fracture shear strength than FSLW joints, as ultrasonic vibration helps to mix the material at the interface, thus, enlarging the SZ and diminishing the cold lap defects.},

ABSTRACT = {The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has disrupted modern societies and their economies. The resurgence in COVID-19 cases as part of the second wave is observed across Europe and the Americas. The scientific response has enabled a complete structural characterization of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome—novel Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Among the most relevant proteins required by the novel coronavirus to facilitate the cell entry mechanism is the spike protein. This protein possesses a receptor-binding domain (RBD) that binds the cellular angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and then triggers the fusion of viral and host cell membranes. In this regard, a comprehensive characterization of the structural stability of the spike protein is a crucial step to find new therapeutics to interrupt the process of recognition. On the other hand, it has been suggested that the participation of more than one RBD is a possible mechanism to enhance cell entry. Here, we discuss the protein structural stability based on the computational determination of the dynamic contact map and the energetic difference of the spike protein conformations via the mapping of the hydration free energy by the Poisson–Boltzmann method. We expect our result to foster the discussion of the number of RBD involved during recognition and the repurposing of new drugs to disable the recognition by discovering new hotspots for drug targets apart from the flexible loop in the RBD that binds the ACE2.},

ABSTRACT = {Stainless steels are increasingly used in construction today, especially in harsh environments, in which steel corrosion commonly occurs. Cold-formed stainless steel structures are currently increasing in popularity because of its efficiency in load-bearing capacity and its appealing architectural appearance. Cold-rolling and press-braking are the cold-working processes used in the forming of stainless steel sections. Press braking can produce large cross-sections from thin to thick-walled sections compared to cold-rolling. Cold-forming in press-braked sections significantly affect member behaviour and joints; therefore, they have attained great attention from many researchers to initiate investigations on those effects. This paper examines the behaviour of residual stress distribution of stainless steel press-braked sections by implementing three-dimensional finite element (3D-FE) technique. The study proposed a full finite element procedure to predict the residual stresses starting from coiling-uncoiling to press-braking. This work considered material anisotropy to examine its effect on the residual stress distribution. The technique adopted was compared with different finite element techniques in the literature. This study also provided a parametric study for three corner radius-to-thickness ratios looking at the through-thickness residual stress distribution of four stainless steels (i.e., ferritic, austenitic, duplex, lean duplex) in which have their own chemical composition. In conclusion, the comparison showed that the adopted technique provides a detailed prediction of residual stress distribution. The influence of geometrical aspects is more pronounced than the material properties. Neglecting the material anisotropy shows higher shifting in the neutral axis. The parametric study showed that all stainless steel types have the same stress through-thickness distribution. Moreover, R/t ratios’ effect is insignificant in all transverse residual stress distributions, but a slight change to R/t ratios can affect the longitudinal residual stress distribution.},

Optimization of sintering condition has densified the sintered samples while embedded beta willemite (β-Zn2SiO4) and alpha willemite (α-Zn2SiO4) were proven in X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) has shown the distribution of willemite crystals in rhombohedral shape crystals and successfully form closely-packed grains due to intense crystallization. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of all sintered ZBS glasses presented various emission peaks at 425, 463, 487, 531, and 643 nm corresponded to violet, blue, green, and red emission, respectively. The correlation between the densification, phase transformation, microstructure, and photoluminescence of Zn2SiO4 glass-ceramic phosphor is discussed in detail.},

ABSTRACT = {This article presents research results into the application of an artificial neural network (ANN) to determine coal’s sorption parameters, such as the maximal sorption capacity and effective diffusion coefficient. Determining these parameters is currently time-consuming, and requires specialized and expensive equipment. The work was conducted with the use of feed-forward back-propagation networks (FNNs); it was aimed at estimating the values of the aforementioned parameters from information obtained through technical and densitometric analyses, as well as knowledge of the petrographic composition of the examined coal samples. Analyses showed significant compatibility between the values of the analyzed sorption parameters obtained with regressive neural models and the values of parameters determined with the gravimetric method using a sorption analyzer (prediction error for the best match was 6.1% and 0.2% for the effective diffusion coefficient and maximal sorption capacity, respectively). The established determination coefficients (0.982, 0.999) and the values of standard deviation ratios (below 0.1 in each case) confirmed very high prediction capacities of the adopted neural models. The research showed the great potential of the proposed method to describe the sorption properties of coal as a material that is a natural sorbent for methane and carbon dioxide.},

ABSTRACT = {Experimental series of alloys for (Sm,Zr)(Co,Cu,Fe)Z permanent magnets are presented in the concentration ranges that provide wide variations of (4f)/(4d)/(3d) ratios of comprising elements. Optical metallographic analysis, observation of the surface domain structure upon magnetization reversal (Kerr effect), electron microprobe analysis, and measuring the major hysteresis loops of samples at different stages of heat treatment are used to study processes related to the development of the highly coercive state of these samples. It was found that the volume fractions of two main structural components A and B, which comprise 90% of the total sample volume, rigorously control the coercivity at all stages of thermal aging. At the same time, structural components A and B themselves in samples being in the high-coercivity state differ qualitatively and quantitatively in the chemical composition, domain structure and its development in external magnetic fields and, therefore, are characterized by different morphologies of the phases comprising the structural components. Two stages of phase transformations in the sample structure are observed. During isothermal annealing, the cellular structure develops within the B component, whereas, during stepwise (slow) cooling or quenching from the isothermal aging temperature to 400 °C, a phase structure evolves within both the cell boundaries in B and the structural component A. The degree of completion of the phase transformations within micro- and nano-volumes of the components determines the ultimate hysteretic characteristics of the material.},

ABSTRACT = {Continuous pressure put on researchers all over the world these days to design materials of improved properties create opportunities to study new methods of production in conjunction with entirely new and innovative materials such as alloys or composites. The authors in the current research manufactured aluminium reinforced with glass fibre (GF) using metallurgical synthesis, which is an unconventional and not sufficiently studied method of production. The composites with 1, 2 and 5 wt.% of glass fibre were produced with additional material obtained using consolidation of aluminium powder in extrusion process as reference material with 5 wt.% of glass fibre. All the materials were subjected to series of tests in order to determine their microstructure, density, electrical properties, hardness and susceptibility to plastic working in the compression test. It was found that glass fibre during metallurgical synthesis of aluminium composite partially melted and thus did not reinforce the material as well as during extrusion, which has been observed not only in the scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis but also in the analysis of macroscopic physical and mechanical properties. Based on the analysed samples, it may be stated that electrical conductivity of the samples obtained via metallurgical synthesis is higher than might be estimated on the basis of the rule of mixtures and glass fibre content and concerning the sample with 5 wt.% of GF is higher (32.1 MS/m) than of the reference material obtained in extrusion process (30.6 MS/m). Similar situation has been observed in terms of hardness of the tested samples where a minor increase in hardness was noticeable as the amount of glass fibre increased in the composites obtained by metallurgical synthesis. It is believed to be related to the melting of glass fibre, which reduced the volume fraction of GF containing mainly silicon oxides and their diffusion into the aluminium matrix, thus causing solid solution strengthening.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper aims to analyze the effect of deformation on the phase transformation kinetics of low-carbon structural steel. The steel used for the investigation was subjected to two different dilatometric analyses using a DIL 805A/D device. The first analysis was to determine the phase transformation kinetics without deformation of austenite before cooling. Then, the analysis under deformation conditions was conducted to investigate the deformation effect on the transformation kinetics. Microscopic studies by light microscopy were performed. The essential part of the research was hardness analysis for different cooling rates and the creation of continuous-cooling-transformation (CCT) and deformation continuous-cooling-transformation (DCCT) diagrams. It was found that the deformation of the samples before cooling increases a diffusion rate in the austenite resulting in the corresponding increase of ferritic, pearlitic, and bainitic start temperatures, as well as shifting the austenite transformation product regions to a longer time. The increase of the transformation area and a decrease in grain size are observed for the deformed samples.},

ABSTRACT = {In situ high-temperature Raman spectra of polycrystalline KBi(MoO4)2 were recorded from room temperature to 1073 K. Thermal stability of the monoclinic KBi(MoO4)2 was examined by temperature-dependent XRD. The monoclinic phase transformed into the scheelite tetragonal structure at 833 K, and then to the monoclinic phase at 773 K. Quantum chemistry ab initio calculation was performed to simulate the Raman spectra of the structure of KBi(MoO4)2 high-temperature melt. The experimental Raman band at 1023 K was deconvoluted into seven Gaussian peaks, and the calculated results were in good agreement with the experimental data. Therefore, the vibrational modes of Raman peaks of molten KBi(MoO4)2 were assigned. It was confirmed that the isolated structure of [Bi(MoO4)2]− monomer, consisting of Mo6+ centers and Bi3+ sub-centers connected by edge-sharing, mainly exists in the melt of KBi(MoO4)2.},

ABSTRACT = {The effect of gallium on the oxide film structure and overall oxidation resistance of low melting point Sn–Bi–Zn alloys was investigated under air atmosphere using thermogravimetric analyses. The liquid alloys studied had a Ga content of 1–7 wt.%. The results showed that the growth rates of the surface scale formed on the Sn–Bi–Zn–Ga alloys conformed to the parabolic law. The oxidation resistance of Sn–Bi–Zn alloys was improved by Ga addition and the activation energies increased from 12.05 kJ∙mol−1 to 22.20 kJ∙mol−1. The structure and elemental distribution of the oxide film surface and cross-section were found to become more complicated and denser with Ga addition. Further, the results of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction show that Ga elements accumulate on the surface of the liquid metal to form oxides, which significantly slowed the oxidation of the surface of the liquid alloy.},

ABSTRACT = {Previous studies have shown that components with an unequal-walled concrete-filled rectangular hollow section (CFRHS) can achieve a greater resistance under bending than those with equal-walled CFRHS. However, the study on the compressive behavior of the CFRHS column is limited. Therefore, this paper investigates the performance of compressed CFRHS columns with unequal flange thickness, based on experimental and numerical approaches. In the test, the effects of slenderness and eccentricity on the compressive capacity of the CFRHS columns with unequal shell thickness are discussed. Numerical models based on the finite element method are established, to evaluate the resistance and failure pattern of each specimen in the test. Parametric studies are carried out based on the validated model, to investigate the effect of eccentricity, wall thickness, and steel and concrete material properties on the load-bearing capacity of the compressed CFRHS column. In addition, the analytical expressions of the resistance of CFRHS columns with unequal wall thickness are derived, and the prediction values are validated through comparing with the test results. It is found that eccentric compressed columns with unequal-walled CFRHS have a similar load-bearing capacity and better ductility when compared with the equal-walled CFRHS.},

ABSTRACT = {A novel structure aluminosilicate molecular sieve, named BUCT-3, was prepared by dynamic hydrothermal synthesis, and the critical factor to obtain the new structure is using an active silicon and aluminum source, aluminosilica perhydrate hydrogel. Meanwhile, only high content of O-O bonds can ensure the pure phase of BUCT-3. Through the characterization of x-ray powder diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and so on, some structure and morphology information of BUCT-3 molecular sieves as well as the special silicon and aluminum source was obtained. It’s worth noticing that the O-O bonds of reactants can be reserved in the products, and thus, help us to get a new structure with cell parameters a = 8.9645 Å, b = 15.2727 Å, c = 11.3907 Å, α = 90°, β = 93.858°, γ = 90°. The crystal system is monoclinic. Though the thermostability of BUCT-3 is not satisfactory, its potential application derived from O-O bonds cannot be neglected.},

ABSTRACT = {We report on the comprehensive experimental and theoretical studies of magnetic and electronic structural properties of the Gd0.4Tb0.6Co2 compound crystallization in the cubic Laves phase (C15). We present new results and compare them to those reported earlier. The magnetic study was completed with electronic structure investigations. Based on magnetic isotherms, magnetic entropy change (ΔSM) was determined for many values of the magnetic field change (Δμ0H), which varied from 0.1 to 7 T. In each case, the ΔSM had a maximum around room temperature. The analysis of Arrott plots supplemented by a study of temperature dependency of Landau coefficients revealed that the compound undergoes a magnetic phase transition of the second type. From the M(T) dependency, the exchange integrals between rare-earth R-R (JRR), R-Co (JRCo), and Co-Co (JCoCo) atoms were evaluated within the mean-field theory approach. The electronic structure was determined using the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) method as well as by calculations using the density functional theory (DFT) based Full Potential Linearized Augmented Plane Waves (FP-LAPW) method. The comparison of results of ab initio calculations with the experimental data indicates that near TC the XPS spectrum collects excitations of electrons from Co3d states with different values of exchange splitting. The values of the magnetic moment on Co atoms determined from magnetic measurements, estimated from the XPS spectra, and results from ab initio calculations are quantitatively consistent.},

ABSTRACT = {A novel approach has been developed for quantitative evaluation of the susceptibility of steels and alloys to hydrogen embrittlement. The approach uses a combination of hydrogen thermal desorption spectroscopy (TDS) analysis with recent advances in machine learning technology to develop a regression artificial neural network (ANN) model predicting hydrogen-induced degradation of mechanical properties of steels. We describe the thermal desorption data processing, artificial neural network architecture development, and the learning process beneficial for the accuracy of the developed artificial neural network model. A data augmentation procedure was proposed to increase the diversity of the input data and improve the generalization of the model. The study of the relationship between thermal desorption spectroscopy data and the mechanical properties of steel evidences a strong correlation of their corresponding parameters. A prototype software application based on the developed model is introduced and is openly available. The developed prototype based on TDS analysis coupled with ANN is shown to be a valuable engineering tool for steel characterization and quantitative prediction of the degradation of steel properties caused by hydrogen.},

ABSTRACT = {The properties of copper in its solid state are strongly affected by the crystallization conditions of the liquid material. ETP grade copper (Electrolytic Tough Pitch Copper) contains oxygen, which causes Cu2O oxide to crystallize in the interdendritic spaces during solidification process which due to the shape of continuous casting mould and the feed of liquid copper during the crystallization process in strand casting might cause a high risk of macrosegregation of oxygen in the copper structure. In the current paper the implied interactions of the dendritic structure of the copper strand in terms of homogeneity at the cross-section of its electrical, mechanical and plastic properties determined based on the samples taken parallelly and perpendicularly to the surface of the dendritic boundaries were analysed. The obtained results were confronted with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the fractures formed during uniaxial tensile test. It has been observed that when the crystallites were arranged perpendicularly to the tensile direction the yield strength (YS) was lower and the fractures were brittle. On the other hand, when the crystallites were arranged parallelly to the tensile direction the fractures were plastic and elongated necking was observed along with the higher YS and total elongation values. The differences in values vary in terms of the applied direction of the tensile force. A characteristic positioning of the Cu2O oxide particles inside the fracture depending on the crystallite alignment and the direction of the applied tensile force has been observed.},

ABSTRACT = {The following article is the presentation attempt of cellulose hybrid chemical modification approach as a useful tool in improving the mechanical properties of plant fiber-filled polymer materials. The treatment process is a prolonged method of the cellulose maleinization and consists of two steps: 1. solvent exchange (altering fiber structure); 2. maleic anhydride (MA) chemical grafting (surface modification). Thanks to the incorporated treatment method, the created ethylene–norbornene copolymer composite specimen exhibited an improved performance, tensile strength at the level of (38.8 ± 0.8) MPa and (510 ± 20)% elongation at break, which is higher than for neat polymer matrix and could not be achieved in the case of regular MA treatment. Moreover, both the Payne effect and filler efficiency factor indicate a possibility of the fiber reinforcing nature that is not a common result. Additionally, the polymer matrix employed in this research is widely known for its excellent resistance to aqueous and polar organic media, good biocompatibility, and the ability to reproduce fine structures which makes it an interesting material regarding healthcare applications. Therefore, plant fiber-based polymer materials described in this research might be potentially applied in this area, e.g., medical devices, drug delivery, wearables, pharmaceutical blisters, and trays.},

Specimens were loaded by tension parallel to the grain and load–deformation diagrams were recorded. Fifty-six specimens with three different distances between the fastener and the loaded end, at different moisture contents, were tested. The results were statistically evaluated using regression analysis, complemented with load–deformation curves, and compared with calculations according to the valid standard for design of timber structures. A decrease in the evaluated load-carrying capacity with increasing moisture content was confirmed experimentally. A slight increase in the evaluated load-carrying capacity with increasing fastener distance from the loaded end was found.},

ABSTRACT = {In Cu-Cr alloys, the strengthening effects of Cr are severely limited due to the relatively low Cr solid solubility in Cu matrix. In addition, apart from the dissolved Cr, it should be noted that high proportion of Cr in Cu matrix work as the second phase dispersion strengthening. Therefore, it is of great significance to extend the Cr solid solubility and decrease the size of the undissolved Cr phase to nano-structure. In this work, the nano-sized Cu-5 wt.% Cr solid solution was achieved through high energy ball milling (HEBM) only for 12 h. The Cr solubility of ~1.15 at.% was quantitatively calculated based on XRD patterns, which means supersaturated solid solution was realized. Except for the dissolved Cr, the undissolved Cr phase was with nano-sized work as the second phase. Upon milling of the Cu-Cr powders with coarse grains, the crystallite sizes and grain sizes are found to decrease with the milling time, and remain almost unchanged at a steady-state with continued milling. In addition, it was found that the stored energy induced by dislocation density increment and grain size refinement would be high enough to overcome the thermodynamic barrier for the formation of solid solution.},

ABSTRACT = {The transient nature of the internal pore structure of particulate wall flow filters, caused by the continuous deposition of particulate matter, makes studying their flow and filtration characteristics challenging. In this article we present a new methodology and first experimental demonstration of time resolved in-situ synchrotron micro X-ray computed tomography (micro-CT) to study aerosol filtration. We directly imaged in 4D (3D plus time) pore scale deposits of TiO2 nanoparticles (nominal mean primary diameter of 25 nm) with a pixel resolution of 1.6 μm. We obtained 3D tomograms at a rate of ∼1 per minute. The combined spatial and temporal resolution allows us to observe pore blocking and filling phenomena as they occur in the filter’s pore space. We quantified the reduction in filter porosity over time, from an initial porosity of 0.60 to a final porosity of 0.56 after 20 min. Furthermore, the penetration depth of particulate deposits and filtration rate was quantified. This novel image-based method offers valuable and statistically relevant insights into how the pore structure and function evolves during particulate filtration. Our data set will allow validation of simulations of automotive wall flow filters. Evolutions of this experimental design have potential for the study of a wide range of dry aerosol filters and could be directly applied to catalysed automotive wall flow filters.},

ABSTRACT = {Two different mesoscale models based on dislocation reactions are developed and applied to predict both the flow stress and the microstructure evolution during the hot deformation of titanium alloys. Three distinct populations of dislocations, named mobile, immobile, and wall dislocations, describe the microstructure, together with the crystal misorientation and the densities of boundaries. A simple model consisting of production and recovery terms for the evolution of dislocations is compared with a comprehensive model that describes the reactions between different type of dislocations. Constitutive equations connect the microstructure evolution with the flow stresses. Both models consider the formation of a high angle grain boundary by continuous dynamic recrystallization due to progressive lattice rotation. The wall dislocation density evolution is calculated as a result of the subgrain size and boundary misorientation distribution evolutions. The developed models are applied to two near-β titanium alloys, Ti-5553 and Ti-17, and validated for use in hot compression experiments. The differences in the predictability between the developed models are discussed for the flow stress, dislocation densities and microstructure evolutions. Only the comprehensive model can predict the different reactions and their contributions to the evolution of mobile and immobile dislocation densities. The comprehensive model also allows for correlating the elastic strain rate with the softening and hardening kinetics. Despite those differences, the selection of the model used has a small influence on the overall prediction of the subgrain size and the fraction of high angle grain boundaries.},

ABSTRACT = {Strength and stiffness are the key parameters characterising the bond performance of fibres in concrete. However, a straightforward procedure for estimating the bond parameters of a synthetic macro-fibre does not exist. This study employs pull-out tests to investigate the bond behaviour of synthetic macro-fibres. Two types of macro-fibres available in the market were investigated. A gripping system was developed to protect the fibres from local damage. The experimental campaign consisted of two stages. At the first stage, 32 concrete specimens were manufactured for performing 96 pull-out tests (three fibre samples were embedded in each cube perpendicular to the top surface and two sides). Two types of macro-fibres with either 10 or 20 mm embedment length were tested. The obtained load–displacement diagrams from pull-out tests demonstrate that the bond performance (characterised by the strength and deformation modulus) of the “top” fibres is almost 20% weaker than fibres positioned to the side surfaces. At the second stage, one type of macro-fibre was chosen for further experimentation of the feasibility of improving the bond performance through the use of colloidal silica or steel micro-fibres. This investigation stage employed an additional 36 concrete specimens. The use of steel micro-fibres was found to be an efficient alternative. The success of this solution requires a suitable proportioning of the concrete.},

ABSTRACT = {Environment-friendly medium-density fiberboards (MDFs) prepared using sodium lignosulfonate/chitosan adhesives (L/C) show potential in environment-friendly wood-based panel application. However, the synthesis mechanism of this adhesive and the relationships between synthesis mechanism and bonding performance were not discussed in depth. Herein, the synthesis mechanism of L/C was explored in detail based on characterizations of L/C with different mass ratios of sodium lignosulfonate to chitosan by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, and X-ray diffraction. For L/C with different mass ratios of sodium lignosulfonate to chitosan, the corresponding bonding performance was also determined based on characterizations of mechanical and dimensional performance of MDFs. Results showed a 3D network structure of L/C formed through the hydrogen linkages among hydroxyl groups in sodium lignosulfonate and hydroxyl and amino groups in chitosan, amide linkages resulted from reaction between carbonyl groups in sodium lignosulfonate and amino groups in chitosan, and sulfonamide linkages originated from reaction between sulfonic groups in sodium lignosulfonate and amino groups in chitosan. The mechanical performance of MDF was closely related to the 3D network and amino groups of L/C, while the dimensional performance of MDF was negatively affected by sodium lignosulfonate. The MDFs with 1:3 and 1:2 mass ratios of sodium lignosulfonate to chitosan showed superior mechanical properties and comparable dimensional performance with a commercial panel.},

ABSTRACT = {This publication presents an assessment of the influence of a surface treatment such as shot-peening on the fatigue life of a compressor blade exposed to resonant vibrations. As part of the work, a geometric model of the blade was developed, and a numerical modal and fatigue analysis were performed. The fatigue analysis was based on the Manson–Coffin–Basquin and Ramberg–Osgood models. Additionally, the location of the highest equivalent stresses was established. Based on the results of the strength analysis, two points were identified where a fatigue crack may potentially occur. As part of the work, the influence of different values of residual stresses on the results of the fatigue life was determined. The obtained results were compared to the literature values of fatigue life for this blade. A secondary objective of the study was to determine the size of the grains at various points of the blade, as well as the thickness of the layer plasticized as a result of peening. The relationship between the location of the highest values of the equivalent stresses and the thickness of the plasticized layer was determined. An explanation of the effect of shot-peening on the increase in the fatigue life of the blade was proposed.},

This system can shorten the construction duration and decrease the floor height and structural weight, owing to features such as a low thickness and light weight. However, studies on the vibration characteristics of this new floor system have not been performed yet. As the general thickness of the iFLASH system ranges from 25 to 30 mm, it must have a sufficient floor vibration performance in order to be utilized. To evaluate the floor vibration performance of the iFLASH system, an experiment was performed in two buildings where the system was applied. This paper presents the results of the dynamic characteristics and serviceability testing as basic data for the vibration characteristics of the iFLASH system.},

ABSTRACT = {In this work, we demonstrate the application of differential reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) to monitor the growth of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) using chemical vapor deposition (CVD). The growth process, optical properties, and structure evolution of MoS2 were recorded by in-situ DRS. Indeed, blue shifts of the characteristic peak B were discussed with the decrease of temperature. We also obtained the imaginary part of the MoS2 dielectric constant according to reflectance spectra. This method provides an approach for studying the change of two-dimensional (2D) materials’ dielectric constant with temperature. More importantly, our work emphasizes that the DRS technique is a non-destructive and effective method for in-situ monitoring the growth of 2D materials, which is helpful in guiding the preparation of 2D materials.},

ABSTRACT = {The kinetics of ferritic transformation and the corresponding microstructural evolution in 0.17C-3.1Mn-1.6Al-0.04Nb-0.22Mo-0.22Si medium-Mn steel during isothermal annealing was investigated in dilatometric studies. The material was subjected to thermal and thermo-mechanical treatments aimed at obtaining, by the austenite → ferrite transformation, a sufficient fraction of ferrite to stabilize the retained austenite by C and eventual Mn partitioning. The samples were isothermally held for 5 h in a temperature range from 600 to 750 °C to simulate simplified temperature conditions of an industrial coiling process following hot rolling. Some of the samples were plastically deformed at a temperature of 900 °C before isothermal holding in order to study the effect of hot deformation on the kinetics of phase transformations. After the dilatometric investigations the material was subjected to light and scanning electron microscopy to reveal relationships between the holding temperature, deformation and microstructure evolution. Hardness tests were performed to assess the mechanical behavior. A significant effect of manganese in slowing down diffusional transformations during the cooling of steel was found. The influence of austenite deformation on the kinetics of austenite to ferrite transformation was noted. The plastically deformed samples showed an accelerated start of ferritic transformation and the extension of its range. During dilatometric tests, low-range dynamic ferritic transformation was recorded, which was also confirmed by the microscopic tests.},

ABSTRACT = {The interface defeat and dwell can effectively improve the ballistic performance of ceramic armors under high velocity impact of long rod projectiles. Confinement conditions along both axial and radial directions of ceramic armors can affect these behaviors. With the aim of giving an insight into the effect of cover plate thickness and connection mode of cover plates with confining tubes on these behaviors, numerical simulations were performed in which the confined silicon carbide (SiC) targets with cover plates were impacted by tungsten rods. The pressure on the surfaces of SiC targets with fixed cover plates are compared to that with free cover plates, showing that the plates fixed with the confining tubes can produce higher pressure by way of wedging. With the increase in cover plate thickness, the dwell duration of the tungsten rods on the ceramic interface gradually grows. In addition, the upper and lower limits of transition impact velocities for the SiC targets with cover plates in different connection modes (i.e., free or fixed) were obtained and analyzed. The results show that the increase rate of the transition velocity region for the cover plate with the fixed-mode is relatively stable and lower than with the free-mode. On this basis, the fixed cover plate contributes higher ballistic performances to the SiC target than the free cover plate. It is also noteworthy that the size of transition velocity region does not enlarge linearly with the increase in cover plate thickness due to the slow growth of the upper limit. Accordingly, thickness thresholds exist, which are 5 mm and 6 mm for the fixed and free cover plates, respectively. Considering the ballistic performance and economy, the cover plate with the thickness ranging from 3 mm to 5 mm, i.e., 1.5~2.5 times of the tungsten rod diameter, is ideal for the structural dimensions in this paper.},

Based on the Laue patterns and geometrical parameters of airfoils, the number of low-angle boundaries occurring at the upper part of the blades airfoil after heat treatment was calculated. This number for the analyzed group of blades ranged from 5 to 9.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper presents an attempt to generalize the description of the course of specimen temperature changes during the tensile test and to connect the value of the thermoelasto-plastic limit stress with the value of a clear (physical) or proof strength (offset yield strength) on the example of tests of the following aluminum alloy sheets used in Poland for airplane structures: 2024-T3 and D16 in three grades: D16ATV, D16CzATV, and D16UTV. A thermographic camera was used for specimen surface temperature measurement during the tensile test. The Portevine–Le Chatelier effect (the so-called PLC effect) was observed for tests of specimens cut from sheet plates, which was strongly reflected in the temperature fluctuations. The course of temperature change during tensile tests was divided into four characteristic stages related to the occurrence of a clear or offset yield strength. It was found that if there is a clear yield strength, the value of the thermoelasto-plastic limit stress was greater than this yield strength. If there was an offset yield strength, the value of the thermoelasto-plastic limit stress was lower than this yield strength. The differences in the aforementioned values of individual yield strengths did not exceed several percent. Thus, it can be concluded that the thermoelasto-plastic limit stress determined on the basis of the course of specimen temperature changes during the tensile test is well correlated with the value of the yield strength of the material.},

ABSTRACT = {The effect of shear deformation introduced by differential speed rolling (DSR) on the microstructure, texture and mechanical properties of Mg-6Sn alloy was investigated. Mg-6Sn sheets were obtained by DSR at speed ratio between upper and lower rolls of R = 1, 1.25, 2 and 3 (R = 1 refers to symmetric rolling). The microstructural and textural changes were investigated by electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) and XRD, while the mechanical performance was evaluated based on tensile tests and calculated Lankford parameters. DSR resulted in the pronounced grain refinement of Mg-6Sn sheets and spreading of basal texture as compared to conventionally rolled one. The average grain size and basal texture intensity gradually decreased with increasing speed ratio. The basal poles splitting to transverse direction (TD) or rolling direction (RD) was observed for all Mg-6Sn sheets. For the as-rolled sheets, YS and UTS increased with increasing speed ratio, but a significant anisotropy of strength and ductility between RD and TD has been observed. After annealing at 300 °C, Mg-6Sn sheets became more homogeneous, and the elongation to failure was increased with higher speed ratios. Moreover, the annealed Mg-6Sn sheets were characterized by a very low normal anisotropy (0.91–1.16), which is normally not achieved for the most common Mg-Al-Zn alloys.},

Therefore, sophisticated microscopy approaches are sought to characterize performance and defects at the nanoscale. Here, we demonstrate, for the first time, the simultaneous assessment of composition, structure, and performance in four-fold multi-modality. Using scanning X-ray microscopy of a Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) solar cell, we measured the elemental distribution of the key absorber elements, the electrical and optical response, and the phase shift of the coherent X-rays with nanoscale resolution. We found structural features in the absorber layer—interpreted as voids—that correlate with poor electrical performance and point towards defects that limit the overall solar cell efficiency.},

ABSTRACT = {Indoor air quality can be adversely affected by emissions from building materials, consequently having a negative impact on human health and well-being. In this study, more than 30 natural building materials (earth dry boards and plasters, bio-based insulation materials, and boards made of wood, flax, reed, straw, etc.) used for interior works were investigated as to their emissions of (semi-)volatile organic compounds ((S)VOC), formaldehyde, and radon. The study focused on the emissions from complete wall build-ups as they can be used for internal partition walls and the internal insulation of external walls. Test chambers were designed, allowing the compounds to release only from the surface of the material facing indoors under testing parameters that were chosen to simulate model room conditions. The emission test results were evaluated using the AgBB evaluation scheme, a procedure for the health-related evaluation of construction products and currently applied for the approval of specific groups of building materials in Germany. Seventeen out of 19 sample build-ups tested in this study would have passed this scheme since they generally proved to be low-emitting and although the combined emissions of multiple materials were tested, 50% of the measurements could be terminated before half of the total testing time.},

ABSTRACT = {Thermal management has become one of the crucial factors in designing electronic equipment and therefore creating composites with high thermal conductivity is necessary. In this work, a new insight on hybrid filler strategy is proposed to enhance the thermal conductivity in Thermoplastic polyurethanes (TPU). Firstly, spherical aluminium oxide/hexagonal boron nitride (ABN) functional hybrid fillers are synthesized by the spray drying process. Then, ABN/TPU thermally conductive composite material is produced by melt mixing and hot pressing. Then, ABN/TPU thermally conductive composite material is produced by melt mixing and hot pressing. Our results demonstrate that the incorporation of spherical hybrid ABN filler assists in the formation of a three-dimensional continuous heat conduction structure that enhances the thermal conductivity of the neat thermoplastic TPU matrix. Hence, we present a valuable method for preparing the thermal interface materials (TIMs) with high thermal conductivity, and this method can also be applied to large-scale manufacturing.},

ABSTRACT = {Nonlinear ultrasound is often employed to assess microdamage or nonlinear elastic properties of a material, and the nonlinear parameter is commonly used to quantify damage sate and material properties. Among the various factors that influence the measurement of nonlinear parameters, maintaining a constant contact pressure between the receiver and specimen is important for repeatability of the measurement. The use of an air-coupled transducer may be considered to replace the contact receiver. In this paper, a method of measuring the relative and absolute nonlinear parameters of materials is described using an air-coupled transducer as a receiver. The diffraction and attenuation corrections are newly derived from an acoustic model for a two-layer medium and the nonlinear parameter formula with all corrections is defined. Then, we show that the ratio of the relative nonlinear parameter of the target sample to the reference sample is equal to that of the absolute nonlinear parameter, and this equivalence is confirmed by measurements on three systems of aluminum samples. The proposed method allows the absolute measurement of the nonlinear parameter ratio or the nonlinear parameter without calibration of the air-coupled receiver and removes restrictions on the selection of reference samples.},

ABSTRACT = {Inorganically-bound core materials are used in foundries in high quantities. However, there is no validated mechanical failure criterion, which allows performing finite-element calculations on the core geometries, yet. With finite-element simulations, the cores could be optimised for various production processes from robotic core handling to the decoring process after the casting. To identify a failure criterion, we propose testing methods, that enable us to investigate the fracture behaviour of inorganically-bound core materials. These novel testing methods induce multiple bi-axial stress states into the specimens and are developed for cohesive frictional materials in general and for sand cores in particular. This allows validating failure criteria in principal stress space. We found that a Mohr-Coulomb model describes the fracture of inorganic core materials in a plane stress state quite accurately and adapted it to a failure criterion, which combines the Mohr-Coulomb model with the Weakest-Link theory in one consistent mechanical material model. This novel material model has been successfully utilised to predict the fracture force of a Brazilian test. This prediction is based on the stress fields of a finite element method (FEM) calculation.},

ABSTRACT = {Formaldehyde is considered as carcinogenic and is emitted from particleboards and plywood used in toy manufacturing. Currently, the flask method is frequently used in Europe for market surveillance purposes to assess formaldehyde release from toys, but its concordance to levels measured in emission test chambers is poor. Surveillance laboratories are unable to afford laborious and expensive emission chamber testing to comply with a new amendment of the European Toy Directive; they need an alternative method that can provide reliable results. Therefore, the application of miniaturised emission test chambers was tested. Comparisons between a 1 m3 emission test chamber and 44 mL microchambers with two particleboards over 28 days and between a 24 L desiccator chamber and the microchambers with three puzzle samples over 10 days resulted in a correlation coefficient r2 of 0.834 for formaldehyde at steady state. The correlation between the results obtained in microchambers vs. flask showed a high variability over 10 samples (r2: 0.145), thereby demonstrating the error-proneness of the flask method in comparison to methods carried out under ambient parameters. An exposure assessment was also performed for three toy puzzles: indoor formaldehyde concentrations caused by puzzles were not negligible (up to 8 µg/m3), especially when more conservative exposure scenarios were considered.},

Coupling the time-temperature equivalence principle, multi-phase finite element approach, Laplace transformation and Prony series fitting technology, the character of the stress relaxation behaviors at three scales subject to variation in temperature is investigated, and the equivalent time-dependent thermal expansion coefficients (TTEC), the equivalent time-dependent thermal relaxation modulus (TTRM) under micro-scale and meso-scale were predicted. Furthermore, the impacts of temperature, structural parameters and relaxation time on the time-dependent thermo-viscoelastic properties of 3D braided four-directional composites were studied.},

Two perfect absorption peaks were obtained at 6.94 and 10.68 μm with simple single-layer metal-graphene metamaterials; the peaks show absorption values higher than 99%. The mechanism of absorption was analyzed theoretically. The independent tunability of the metamaterial absorber (MA) was realized by varying the Fermi level of graphene under a set of resonators. Furthermore, multi-band and wide-band absorption were observed by the proposed structure upon increasing the number of resonators and resizing them in the unit cell. The obtained results demonstrate the multipurpose performance of this type of absorber and indicate its potential application in diverse applications, such as solar energy harvesting and thermal absorbing.},

ABSTRACT = {Zeta potential is frequently used to examine the colloidal stability of particles and macromolecules in liquids. Recently, it has been suggested that zeta potential can also play an important role for grouping and read-across of nanoforms in a regulatory context. Although the measurement of zeta potential is well established, only little information is reported on key metrological principles such as validation and measurement uncertainties. This contribution presents the results of an in-house validation of the commonly used electrophoretic light scattering (ELS) and the relatively new particle tracking analysis (PTA) methods. The performance characteristics were assessed by analyzing silica and polystyrene reference materials. The ELS and PTA methods are robust and have particle mass working ranges of 0.003 mg/kg to 30 g/kg and 0.03 mg/kg to 1.5 mg/kg, respectively. Despite different measurement principles, both methods exhibit similar uncertainties for repeatability (2%), intermediate precision (3%) and trueness (4%). These results confirm that the developed methods can accurately measure the zeta potential of silica and polystyrene particles and can be transferred to other laboratories that analyze similar types of samples. If direct implementation is impossible, the elaborated methodologies may serve as a guide to help laboratories validating their own methods.},

ABSTRACT = {In order to determine the potential environmental impact of construction products, it is necessary to evaluate their influence on organisms exposed to them or their eluates under environmental conditions. The behavior of the white worm Enchytraeus albidus is a useful tool for assessing the potential environmental impact of construction products in contact with water and soil. This study investigates the environmental effects of eluates from two construction products, a reactive waterproofing product, and an injection resin, on the reproduction and avoidance behavior of E. albidus. The eluates were prepared according to existing guidelines. The soil used for the tests was moistened with the eluates of the construction products. The reproduction results of the worms were collected after six weeks of exposure. Offsprings were counted under the microscope and statistically analyzed. Results from the avoidance behavior were collected after 48 h of exposure, and results were compared with the reproduction results. The eluates from both construction products induced significant changes in the reproduction behavior of E. albidus. Undiluted or only slightly diluted eluates of the injection resin drastically reduced the reproduction of the worms, whereas the leaches of the reactive waterproofing product only had a minor effect. The avoidance results for the injection resin indicates that its presence in the habitat is clearly detrimental to the survival of E. albidus, while the avoidance results for the waterproofing resin showed an initial avoidance of the eluates, but no harmful effects were observed. The avoidance test is a way of rapid toxicity screening of environmental samples when time is a critical parameter to measure possible environmental effects. This study shows that ecotoxicological tests using Enchytraeids are a valuable and important tool for understanding the mode of action of eluates from construction products in the environment.},

ABSTRACT = {Tools and machine surfaces are subjected to various types of damage caused by many different factors. Due to this, the protecting coatings characterized by the best properties for a given treatment or environment are used. AlCrN coatings with different compositions, synthesized by different methods, are often of interest to scientists. The aim of the presented work was the deposition and investigation of two sets of coatings: (1) formed in nitrogen pressure from 0.8 Pa to 5 Pa and (2) formed at arc current from 50 A to 100 A. We study relationships between the above technological parameters and discuss their properties. Coatings formed at nitrogen pressure (pN2) up to 3 Pa crystallize both in hexagonal AlN structure and the cubic CrN structure. For pN2 > 3 Pa, they crystallize in the CrN cubic structure. Crystallite size increases with nitrogen pressure. The coatings formed at different arc currents have a cubic CrN structure and the crystallite size is independent of the current. The adhesion of the coatings is very good, independent of nitrogen pressure and arc current.},

ABSTRACT = {In this work, the deformation behaviour of a twin-roll cast (TRC) Mg-6.8Y-2.5Zn-0.4Zr alloy during plane strain compression was characterised by high-temperature testing. Based on the experimental data, the values of strain-rate sensitivity, the efficiency of power dissipation and the instability parameter were investigated under the conditions of various hot deformation parameters. In contrast to conventionally cast material, no lamellae of the LPSO (long period stacking ordered) phase were precipitated in the magnesium matrix after TRC. The precipitation of fine lamellar LPSO phases only occurred during cooling to forming temperature after the heat treatment. Dynamic recrystallization (DRX) hardly occurred during deformation at temperatures between 350 °C and 400 °C. This can be attributed to the precipitation of the lamellar LSPO phases, which contribute to retardation of the DRX process. At higher deformation temperatures and strain rates DRX is pronounced and the twin-induced (TRDX) as well as continuous dynamic recrystallization could be identified as the dominant softening mechanisms. The processing maps were established by superimposing the instability map over the power dissipation map, this being associated with microstructural evolution analysis in the hot deformation processes. Two instability zones could be recognised for the twin-roll cast and heat-treated Mg-6.8Y-2.5Zn-0.4Zr alloy: (1) 350 °C to 460 °C and 0.01 s−1 to 0.3 s−1 and (2) 485 °C to 525 °C and 2.5 s−1 to 10 s−1, where deformation is not favourable.},

ABSTRACT = {The structural and strength analysis of the materials used to construct an important engine element such as the turbine is of great significance, at both the design stage and during tests and training relating to emergency situations. This paper presents the results of a study on the chemical composition, morphology, and phased structure of the metallic construction material used to produce the blades of the high- and low-pressure turbines of the RD-33 jet engine, which is the propulsion unit of the MiG-29 aircraft. On the basis of an analysis of the chemical composition and phased structure, the data obtained from tests of the blade material allowed the grade of the alloy used to construct the tested elements of the jet engine turbine to be determined. The structural stability of the material was found to be lower in comparison with the engine operating conditions, which was shown by a clear decrease in the resistance properties of the blade material. The results obtained may be used as a basis for analyzing the life span of an object or a selection of material replacements, which may enable the production of the analyzed engine element.},

ABSTRACT = {Impulse Friction Stir Welding (IFSW) was utilized to join 6082–T6 alloy plates at various impulse frequencies. A distinctive feature of IFSW is the generation of mechanical impulses that enhances the forging action of the tool, and thereby, alters the weld microstructure. The microstructural evolution in the Stir Zone (SZ) with special focus on the strengthening precipitation behavior, and overall mechanical properties of the IFSW joints have been investigated. It was demonstrated that the strengthening β″ precipitates reprecipitated in the SZ of the IFSW joints during natural aging. In contrast, no precipitates were found in the SZ of the Friction Stir Welding (FSW) weld. Partial reversion of β″ after IFSW is supposed to occur due to more developed subgrain network and higher dislocation density introduced by impulses that accelerated precipitation kinetics. Dynamic recrystallisation was facilitated by impulses resulting in a fine, homogeneous structure. There was no significant difference between the microhardness in the SZ, tensile and yield strength of the FSW and IFSW joints. However, the application of impulses demonstrated the smoothing of the hardness reduction in the transition region at the advancing side. The shift of the fracture location from the Heat-Affected Zone (HAZ) by FSW to the SZ as well as higher elongation of the joints by IFSW of lower frequencies could be related to the grain refinement and the change of the grain orientation.},

ABSTRACT = {Interface strength, damage and fracture properties between ceramic films and metallic substrates affect the service reliability of related parts. The films’ thickness, grain size and residual stress affect the interface properties and fracture behavior, thus related studies attract great attention. In this paper, the interface damage evolution and fracture behavior between ceramic films and metallic substrates were simulated by developing a three dimensional finite element model of alumina films on Ni substrates with cohesive elements in the interfaces. The interface fracture energy as a key parameter in the simulation was firstly determined based on its thermodynamic definition. The simulation results show the Mises stress distribution and damage evolution of the film/substrate structures during uniaxial tensile loading. Specially, when grain size of the films is in nanoscale, the interface strength increases obviously, agreeing with the previous experimental results. The effects of residual stress on interface properties was further simulated. The interface strength was found to decrease with increasing radial residual force and the axial residual pressure increases the interface strength. When the thickness of the films increases, the interface strength keeps a constant but the speed of interface damage becomes faster, that is, the thicker films show catastrophic fracture. The underlying mechanism of damage speed was analyzed. Understanding these size effects and the effects of residual stress is helpful to guide the design of related parts.},

ABSTRACT = {Governing cohesive laws in mixed mode I+II loading of Pinus pinaster Ait. are directly identified by coupling the mixed mode bending test with full-field displacements measured at the crack tip by Digital Image Correlation (DIC). A sequence of mixed mode ratios is studied. The proposed data reduction relies on: (i) the compliance-based beam method for evaluating strain energy release rate; (ii) the local measurement of displacements to compute the crack tip opening displacement; and (iii) an uncoupled approach for the reconstruction of the cohesive laws and its mode I and mode II components. Quantitative parameters are extracted from the set of cohesive laws components in function of the global phase angle. Linear functions were adjusted to reflect the observed trends and the pure modes (I and II) fracture parameters were estimated by extrapolation. Results show that the obtained assessments agree with previous experimental measurements addressing pure modes (I and II) loadings on this wood species, which reveals the appropriateness of the proposed methodology to evaluate the cohesive law under mixed mode loading and its components.},

ABSTRACT = {Silicon oxynitrides (SiOxNy) have many advantageous properties for modern ceramic applications that justify a development of their new and efficient preparation methods. In the paper, we show the possibility of preparing amorphous SiOxNy-based materials from selected liquid organosilicon compounds, methyltrimethoxysilane CH3Si(OCH3)3 and methyltriethoxysilane CH3Si(OC2H5)3, by a convenient spray pyrolysis method. The precursor mist is transported with an inert gas or a mixture of reactive gases through a preheated tube reactor to undergo complex decomposition changes, and the resulting powders are collected in the exhaust filter. The powders are produced in the tube at temperatures of 1200, 1400, and 1600 °C under various gas atmosphere conditions. In the first option, argon Ar gas is used for mist transportation and ammonia NH3 gas serves as a reactive medium, while in the second option nitrogen N2 is exclusively applied. Powder X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) results confirm the highly amorphous nature of all products except those made at 1600 °C in nitrogen. SEM examination shows the spheroidal particle morphology of powders, which is typical for this method. Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy reveals the presence of Si–N and Si–O bonds in the powders prepared under Ar/NH3, whereas those produced under N2 additionally contain Si–C bonds. Raman spectroscopy measurements also support some turbostratic free carbon C in the products prepared under nitrogen. The directly determined O- and N-contents provide additional data linking the process conditions with specific powder composition, especially from the point of view of oxygen replacement in the Si–O moieties formed upon initial precursor decomposition reactions by nitrogen (from NH3 or N2) or carbon (from the carbonization of the organic groups).},

ABSTRACT = {Low-alloyed zirconium alloys are widely used in nuclear applications due to their low neutron absorption cross-section. These alloys, however, suffer from limited strength. Well-established guidelines for the development of Ti alloys were applied to design new two-phase ternary Zr alloys with improved mechanical properties. Zr-4Sn-4Nb and Zr-8Sn-4Nb alloys have been manufactured by vacuum arc melting, thermo-mechanically processed by annealing, forging, and aging to various microstructural conditions and thoroughly characterized. Detailed Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis showed that the microstructural response of the alloys is rather similar to alpha + beta Ti alloys. Duplex microstructure containing primary alpha phase particles surrounded by lamellar alpha + beta microstructure can be achieved by thermal processing. Mechanical properties strongly depend on the previous treatment. Ultimate tensile strength exceeding 700 MPa was achieved exceeding the strength of commercial Zr alloys for nuclear applications by more than 50%. Such an improvement in strength more than compensates for the increased neutron absorption cross-section. This study aims to exploit the potential of alpha + beta Zr alloys for nuclear applications.},

ABSTRACT = {Adhesive bonding are becoming increasingly important in civil and mechanical engineering, in the field of mobile applications such as aircraft or automotive. Adhesive joints offer many advantages such as low weight, uniform stress distribution, vibration damping properties or the possibility of joining different materials. The paper presents the results of numerical modeling and the use of neural networks in the analysis of dual adhesive single-lap joints subjected to a uniaxial tensile test. The dual adhesive joint was created through the use of adhesives with various parameters in terms of stiffness and strength. In the axis of the overlap, there was a point bonded joint characterized by greater stiffness and strength, and on the outside, there was a bonded joint limited by the edges of the overlap and characterized by lower stiffness and strength. It is an innovative solution for joining technology and the influence of such parameters as the thickness of one of the adherends, the radius of the point bonded joint and the material parameters of both adhesive layers were analyzed. The joint is characterized by a two-stage degradation process, i.e., after the damage of the rigid adhesive, the flexible adhesive ensures the integrity of the entire joint. For numerical modeling, the Finite Element Method (FEM) and cohesive elements was used, which served as input data to an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The applied approach allowed the impact of individual parameters on the maximum force, initiation energy, and fracture energy to be studied.},

ABSTRACT = {A new type of composite voided slab, the TUBEDECK (TD), which utilizes the structural function of profiled steel decks, has recently been proposed. Previous studies have confirmed that the flexural strength of TD slabs can be calculated based on the full composite contribution of the steel deck, but for long-span flexural members, the deflection serviceability requirement is often dominant. Herein, we derived a novel deflection prediction approach using the results of flexural tests on slab specimens, focusing on TD slabs. First, deflection prediction based on modifications of the current code was proposed. Results revealed that TD slabs exhibited smaller long-term deflections and at least 10% longer maximum span lengths than solid slabs, indicating their greater efficiency. Second, a novel rational method was derived for predicting deflections without computing the effective moment of inertia. The ultimate deflections predicted by the proposed method correlated closely with the deflection under maximum bending moments. To calculate immediate deflections, variation functions for the concrete strain at the extreme compression fiber and neutral axis depth were assumed with predictions in good agreement with experiments. The proposed procedure has important implications in highlighting a new perspective on the deflection prediction of reinforced concrete and composite flexural members.},

ABSTRACT = {Controlling low frequency noise in an interior sound field is always a challenge in engineering, because it is hard to accurately localize the sound source. Spherical acoustic holography can reconstruct the 3D distributions of acoustic quantities in the interior sound field, and identify low-frequency sound sources, but the ultimate goal of controlling the interior noise is to improve the sound quality in the interior sound field. It is essential to know the contributions of sound sources to the sound quality objective parameters. This paper presents the mapping methodology from sound pressure to sound quality objective parameters, where sound quality objective parameters are calculated from sound pressure at each specific point. The 3D distributions of the loudness and sharpness are obtained by calculating each point in the entire interior sound field. The reconstruction errors of those quantities varying with reconstruction distance, sound frequency, and intersection angle are analyzed in numerical simulation for one- and two-monopole source sound fields. Verification experiments have been conducted in an anechoic chamber. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the sound source localization results based on 3D distributions of sound quality objective parameters are different from those based on sound pressure.},

ABSTRACT = {The stress-based finite element method is proposed to solve the static bending problem for the Euler–Bernoulli and Timoshenko models of an elastic beam. Two types of elements—with five and six degrees of freedom—are proposed. The elaborated elements reproduce the exact solution in the case of the piece-wise constant distributed loading. The proposed elements do not exhibit the shear locking phenomenon for the Timoshenko model. The influence of an elastic foundation of the Winkler type is also taken into consideration. The foundation response is approximated by the piece-wise constant and piece-wise linear functions in the cases of the five-degrees-of-freedom and six-degrees-of-freedom elements, respectively. An a posteriori estimation of the approximate solution error is found using the hypercircle method with the addition of the standard displacement-based finite element solution.},

ABSTRACT = {FRP (Fiber Reinforced Polymer) Bar reinforced coral concrete beam is a new type of structural member that has been used more and more widely in marine engineering in recent years. In order to study and predict the flexural performance of CFRP reinforced coral concrete beams, the flexural rigidity, crack morphology and failure mode of concrete were studied in detail. The results show that under the condition of similar reinforcement ratio, the flexural rigidity of CFRP reinforced coral concrete beam is significantly lower than that of ordinary reinforced concrete beam. Increasing the cross-section reinforcement ratio within a certain range can increase the bending stiffness of the test beam or reduce the deflection, but the strength utilization rate of CFRP reinforcement is greatly reduced. The short-term bending stiffness of the CFRP reinforced coral concrete beam calculated by the existing standard formula is obviously higher. This paper proposes a modified formula for introducing the strain inhomogeneity coefficient (ψ) of CFRP bars and considers the relative slip between CFRP bars and coral concrete to predict the short-term flexural stiffness of coral concrete beams reinforced by CFRP bars. The formula was verified with the test results, and it was proved that the formula has a good consistency with the test results.},

ABSTRACT = {Polycrystalline cubic boron nitride (PcBN) are super-hard materials with high hardness and excellent abrasive resistance, widely used in cutting tools for precision machining of automotive and aerospace parts; however, their brittle properties make them prone to premature failure. Coatings are often applied to PcBN to extend their range of applicability and durability. Conventional coating methods are limited to the thickness range of a few hundred nanometres, poor adhesion to the substrate, and limited stability under ambient conditions. To further the properties of PcBN composites, in this paper, we explore the use of ultrasonic bonding to apply thick coatings (30–80 μm) on PcBN cutting tools. For the first time, a multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) powder is preplaced on a PcBN substrate to allow an unconventional coating technique to take place. The effects of ultrasonic bonding parameters on the change of mechanical properties of the coated tools are investigated through scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), micro-hardness analyses, and white light interferometry. The structure of the carbon nanotubes is investigated through transmission electron microscopy (pre coating) and cross-section of the bonded MWCNTs is studied via focused ion beam milling and SEM to evaluate the bonding between the multi-walled nanotubes. Optimum processing windows (i.e., bonding speed, energy, and pressure) are discovered for coating MWCNTs on PcBN. Focus ion beam milling analyses revealed a relationship between consolidation parameters and porosity of MW(pCNT) bonds. The proposed method paves the way for the novel design of functional coatings with attunable properties (i.e., thickness and hardness) and therefore improved productivity in the machining of aerospace and automotive parts.},

ABSTRACT = {Various seismic analysis methods are being used to predict the response of structures to earthquakes. Although nonlinear dynamic analysis (NDA) is considered an ideal method to represent the most realistic behavior of a structure among these various methods, correct results can be derived only when the analysis model is carefully developed by a knowledgeable person. It is particularly important to properly implement the behavior characteristics depending on the reversed cyclic load in the NDA of a building made of reinforced concrete (RC) moment frames. This study evaluated the hysteresis model suitable for NDA of existing RC moment frames, and 45 analysis models were reviewed, in which the pivot, concrete, and Takeda hysteresis models were applied differently to beams and columns. The pivot model was evaluated as the most reliable hysteresis model for each structural member by comparing and analyzing not only the responses of the entire frame but also the responses of column and beam members focusing on energy dissipation. However, this model can have practical limitations in that the parameters associated with the reinforcement detailing and applied loads need to be defined in detail. The analysis model applying Takeda to the beam, which predicted the average response at a reliable level compared to the reference model, was identified as a practical alternative when it is difficult to apply the pivot model to all frame members.},
