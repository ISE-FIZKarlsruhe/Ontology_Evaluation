ABSTRACT = {Fatigue failure of carbon fiber-reinforced plastics (CFRPs) under cyclic loadings has attracted the attention of researchers recently. In this study, the entropy-based failure criterion is proposed to investigate the fatigue lifetime of unidirectional CFRPs subjected to multiple-amplitude cyclic loadings. Due to the heterogeneity of CFRPs, a micro-finite element model considering matrix resin and fibers independently is developed, and the entropy-based damage criterion is implemented into a user-subroutine of Abaqus to model the progressive damage of matrix resin. The fatigue lifetime of CFRPs under typical loading sequences consisting of two stages, such as varying from low to high (L-H) or from high to low (H-L) loading sequence, is estimated with the proposed failure criterion. Numerical results show that the initial damage occurs near the area between two fibers, and a transverse crack propagates progressively under the cyclic loading. The difference in predicted lifetime to final failure in L-H and H-L stress levels is 6.3%. Thus, the effect of loading sequence on the fatigue lifetime can be revealed via the proposed entropy-based damage criterion. Comparisons with the conventional linear cumulative damage (LCD) and kinetic crack growth (KCG) theories are also conducted to demonstrate the validity of the proposed method. The entropy-based failure criterion is a promising method to predict the residual strength and fatigue lifetime of CFRP components.},

ABSTRACT = {Biomass liquefaction is a well-known and extensively described process. Hydrothermal processes are well understood and can be used in the fuel industry. The use of organic solvents can result in full-fledged products for use in the synthesis of polyurethanes. The plastics industry, including polyurethanes, is targeting new, more environmentally friendly solutions. One of these is the replacement of petrochemical polyols with compounds obtained from renewable sources. It is common in biomass liquefaction to use sulfuric acid (VI) as a catalyst. The purpose of the present study was to test the effectiveness of a heterogeneous catalyst such as Nafion ion-exchange resin on the cellulose liquefaction process. The results obtained were compared with the bio-polyols obtained in a conventional way, using a homogeneous catalyst (sulfuric acid (VI)). Depending on the catalyst used and the temperature of the process, bio-polyols characterized, among other things, by a hydroxyl number in the range of 740–400 mgKOH/g were obtained. The research provides new information on the possibility of using heterogeneous catalysts in cellulose liquefaction.},

ABSTRACT = {Additive manufacturing offers significant design freedom and the ability to selectively influence material properties. However, conventional processes like laser powder bed fusion for metals may result in internal defects, such as pores, which profoundly affect the mechanical characteristics of the components. The extent of this influence varies depending on the specific defect type, its size, and morphology. Furthermore, a single component may exhibit various defect types due to the manufacturing process. To investigate these occurrences with regard to other target variables, this study presents a random forest tree model capable of classifying defects in binary images derived from micrographs. Our approach demonstrates a classification accuracy of approximately 95% when distinguishing between keyhole and lack of fusion defects, as well as process pores. In contrast, unsupervised models yielded prediction accuracies below 60%. The model’s accuracy in differentiating between lack of fusion and keyhole defects varies based on the manufacturing process’s parameters, primarily due to the irregular shapes of keyhole defects. We provide the model alongside this paper, which can be utilized on a standard computer without the need for in situ monitoring systems during the additive manufacturing process.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper presents a new solution for shaping the rivet progression of a beverage end. The classic method uses three operations to press the cylindrical rivet using 0.208 mm and 0.203 mm thick sheets. The increasing demand for aluminium alloys is prompting measures to make more efficient use of this raw material. One possible solution is to produce packaging from ever thinner sheets. This requires the design of new tooling and the preparation of an appropriate technological process. A method has been developed to stamp a hexagonal-shaped rivet from 0.200 mm thick sheet metal, increasing the number of stamping operations to four. The proposed method was verified through a numerical analysis using the PAM STAMP 2022.0 software package. It was found that for appropriately shaped tools, sheet thicknesses of the stamped component could be achieved that were not less than those for the currently used technology, thus eliminating any possible break in the material structure. Suitable tools and experimental stamping tests were carried out for the developed process. In the simulations, the material Al5182_iso_Xmm was adopted from the programme database, while the experiments were performed on a laboratory press using AW-5182-H48 sheets with a thickness of 0.200 mm. The purpose of the study was to determine the validity for the proposed method of forming the rivet of the beverage end.},

ABSTRACT = {With the acceleration of the construction of sponge cities in China, porous asphalt pavement (PA) is has been widely used. High-viscosity asphalt (HVA) is the core material in building PA because it has good rheology properties, which can provide good raveling and rutting resistance. However, due to the open-graded structure of PA, HVA was more susceptible to rapid aging, which significantly affects the durability of PA. To investigate the thermal aging effect on the rheological properties of self-modified HVA (SHVA), five types of asphalts were aged using a rolling thin film oven (RTFO) and pressure aging vessel (PAV). Then, rheological tests were adopted, such as temperature sweep test (TS), repeated creep and recovery test (RCR), and bending beam rheometer test (BBR). The results indicate that during the aging process, the oxidation-induced hardening effect of neat asphalt and the degradation-induced softening effect of the modifier changes the rheology properties of HVA significantly. As the aging progresses, the contribution of the modifiers of HVA to anti-aging performance is greatly reduced. At high temperatures, HVA demonstrates better anti-aging performance than conventional styrene–butadiene–styrene (SBS)-modified asphalt (Guo Chuang, GC). The change of the high-temperature rheological indices of the two HVA types (SHVA and TAFPACK-super HVA (TPS)) showed a smaller activation energy index (EAI), a more considerable viscous component of binder creep stiffness (Gv), and more minor accumulated stain (racc), indicating a more significant anti-short-term and long-term aging performance, which is beneficial to the high-temperature performance of asphalts. However, the changes in low-temperature rheological properties do not align with those in high-temperature rheological properties after long-term aging. The BBR test results reveal that TPS exhibits worse low-temperature performance than GC and SHVA. During the thermal aging process, the contribution rate of the modifiers in SHVA against RTFO and PAV aging is higher than that of the modifiers in TPS, which contributes to the superior anti-aging property. Overall, SHVA demonstrates the best anti-aging performance among the five asphalts tested.},

ABSTRACT = {The article describes a specific method of using innovative transverse systems of flat bar frames as structures forcing elastic shape transformations of nominally flat folded sheets into the forms of ruled shell roof coverings. An innovative method for parametric shaping these forms and arrangement of frames constituting structural systems of sheds with folded thin-walled roof coverings, taking account of the specificity of designing elastically transformed roof sheeting, was proposed. The proposed method for defining the loads of the considered frames supporting lower shelves of the folds of transformed roof sheeting, as loads distributed uniformly along the length of the upper chord of a roof frame girder, is also an innovative approach. The above unconventional premises result in the innovative topic of the research presented in terms of checking the impact of changing the shape of subsequent flat frames (intended for the construction of sheds roofed with the transformed sheeting) on the geometric and mechanical properties of the members of these frames. For the defined loads and the proposed parameterization of the frame forms, an innovative set of conditions was developed to optimize their performance, and then a theoretical analysis of the observed dependencies was carried out. This analysis was performed in an unconventional, novel way using section modules of the cross-sections of all members. The performed computer simulations confirmed the significance of changes in the inclination of girders and columns on the geometric and mechanical properties of the members. The obtained results are the basis and justification for simulations and tests in the scope of further modification of the form, loads, work, and methods of using various configurations of flat frames in constructions.},

ABSTRACT = {Ag8SnS6 (ATS) has been reported to have a band gap of 1.33 eV and is expected to be a suitable material for the light-absorbing layers of compound thin-film solar cells. However, studies on solar cells that use ATS are currently lacking. The objective of this study is to obtain high-quality ATS thin films for the realization of compound thin-film solar cells using vacuum deposition and sulfide annealing. First, glass/SnS/Ag stacked precursors are prepared by vacuum deposition. Subsequently, they are converted to the ATS phase via sulfide annealing, and various process conditions, namely, annealing time, annealing temperature, and number of steps, are studied. By setting the heat treatment temperature at 550 °C and the heat treatment time at 60 min, a high-quality ATS thin film could be obtained. Multi-step heat treatment also produces thin films with nearly no segregation or voids.},

ABSTRACT = {Standard Digital Volume Correlation (DVC) approaches enable quantitative analyses of specimen deformation to be performed by measuring displacement fields between discrete states. Such frameworks are thus limited by the number of scans (due to acquisition duration). Considering only one projection per loading step, Projection-based Digital Volume Correlation (P-DVC) allows 4D (i.e., space and time) full-field measurements to be carried out over entire loading histories. The sought displacement field is decomposed over a basis of separated variables, namely, temporal and spatial modes. In the present work, the spatial modes are constructed via scan-wise DVC, and only the temporal amplitudes are sought via P-DVC. The proposed method is applied to a glass fiber mat reinforced polymer specimen containing a machined notch, subjected to in situ cyclic tension and imaged via X-ray Computed Tomography. The P-DVC enhanced DVC method employed herein enables for the quantification of damage growth over the entire loading history up to failure.},

ABSTRACT = {Recent developments in incremental sheet forming have resulted in the creation of novel manufacturing processes that are highly adaptable and could bring significant economic benefits for advanced technologies and low-volume production. In this manuscript, the following variables were examined: the variation in the deformation forces for a part with a pyramidal trunk shape; the variation in the deformations and thinning of the Al 3003 material during the incremental forming process; and the variation in the accuracy of the incrementally formed part and the quality of the surfaces (surface roughness). The components of the forces in the incremental forming have increasing values from the beginning of the process to the maximum value due to the hardening process. The TiN-coated tool ensures lower values of the forming components. Due to the kinematics of the forming process, deviations, especially in shape, from the part in the drawing are observed, which are shown by the radius of curvature of the side wall of the part, the appearance of a radius of connection between the wall and the bottom of the part, as well as dimensional deviations that are expressed by the variation in the forming depth. Concerning the smoothness of the surfaces, it was observed that the best roughness results were obtained in the case of the TiN-coated tool.},

ABSTRACT = {Permeable pavements can decrease the volume of stormwater, thereby mitigating the risk of flooding and reducing the urban heat island effect. This study investigated the influence of incorporating granulated blast-furnace slag (GBFS), hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC), and polypropylene plastic textile fiber (PPTF) on the mechanical properties and water permeability of pervious concrete. Orthogonal tests were employed to conduct the analysis. The findings indicate that the pervious concrete with GBFS, HPMC, and PPTF (termed GBFS-HPMC/fiber pervious concrete) exhibited the highest cubic compressive strength, ultimate tensile strength, and flexural strength. These values were 25.22 MPa, 3.36 MPa, and 5.39 MPa, respectively. The standard deviations for cubic compressive strength, split tensile strength, flexural strength, water permeability coefficient, and porosity, as calculated using SPSS, were 1.57, 0.1, 1.17, 0.35, and 0.4, respectively. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) were used to analyze the microstructure and compositional combinations of the pervious concrete. The analyses revealed that the calcium-silicate-hydrate (C-S-H) gel, produced by GBFS hydration, enhanced the bonding within the interfacial transition zone (ITZ) and between the fibers and aggregates. Additionally, the anchoring and supporting effects of the PPTF in the matrix contributed to stabilizing the overall matrix structure. Lastly, a gray correlation analysis was applied to optimize the admixture. The findings indicate that following the optimization, the cubic compressive strength increased by 7.2%, splitting tensile strength by 2.1%, and flexural strength by 2.5%. In summary, the mechanical properties of pervious concrete improved after optimizing the admixture.},

ABSTRACT = {In this study, our objective is to investigate the anisotropic deformation behavior and the indentation size effect (ISE) of monocrystalline barium fluoride (BaF2) using nanoindentation experiments with a diamond Berkovich indenter. BaF2 is known for its anisotropy, which results in significant variations in its mechanical properties. This anisotropy poses challenges in achieving high processing quality in ultra-precision machining. Through our experiments, we observed numerous pop-in events in the load–displacement curves, indicating the occurrence of plastic deformation in BaF2 crystals, specifically in the (100), (110), and (111) orientations; these pop-in events were observed as the indentation depth increased to 56.9 nm, 58.2 nm, and 57.8 nm, respectively. The hardness–displacement and elastic modulus–displacement curves were obtained from the tests exhibiting the ISE. The nanoindentation hardness of BaF2 is found to be highly dependent on its crystallographic orientation. Similarly, for BaF2 in the (100) orientation, the range is from 2.43 ± 0.74 and 1.24 ± 0.12 GPa. For BaF2 in the (110) orientation, the values range from 2.15 ± 0.66 to 1.18 ± 0.15 GPa. For BaF2 in the (111) orientation, the values range from 2.12 ± 0.53 GPa to 1.19 ± 0.12 GPa. These results highlight the significant influence of crystallographic orientation on the mechanical properties of BaF2. To better understand the ISE, we employed several models including Meyer’s law, the Nix–Gao model, the proportional specimen resistance (PSR) model, and the modified PSR (mPSR) model, and compared them with our experimental results. Among these models, the mPSR model demonstrated the best level of correlation (R2>0.9999) with the experimental measurements, providing a reliable description of the ISE observed in BaF2. Our reports provide valuable insights into the anisotropic mechanical characteristics of BaF2 materials and serve as a theoretical guide for the ultra-precision machining of BaF2.},

ABSTRACT = {Hastelloy N alloy is an excellent oxidation and corrosion-resistant material, which is selected as the shell material for the main vessel of molten salt reactors (MSRs). In this work, we conducted double-sided gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW) on 4 mm thick Hastelloy N alloy plates to examine the microstructure and mechanical properties of the welded joints. The S−N curve was obtained by fatigue test. The experimental results show that fatigue cracks initiate along the weld toe and propagate inward in a fan-shaped pattern. The hardness is highest in the heat-affected zone (HAZ). The fracture mode observed was trans-granular. The plastic zone in the initial stages of crack propagation remained relatively minimal. However, it gradually expanded during subsequent stages of the process. It is noteworthy that the crack propagation process often involves the development of secondary cracks, accompanied by profound plasticity-induced closure effects. The results of our investigation demonstrate that the welded joint exhibits excellent fatigue performance.},

ABSTRACT = {This study was completed in effort to characterize the notch sensitivity of additively manufactured (AM) Inconel 718 produced by laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF). Three different root radii on V-notched test specimens and smooth specimens were evaluated under tensile conditions for specimens built in vertical and horizontal orientations. Both the total axial strain and localized notch diametral strain were measured. Finite element analysis (FEA) was completed on each specimen geometry to confirm the actual strain measurements near the notch. Test results showed the tensile strength of the notched specimens were larger than the tensile strength values of the smooth specimens. These tensile results equate to a notch-sensitivity ratio (NSR) greater than one, indicating that the L-PBF Inconel 718 material is a notch-strengthened material. It is suspected that the notch strengthening is a result of increased triaxial stress produced near the notch tip causing added material constraints, resulting in higher strength values for the notched specimens. Fractography analysis was completed on the various fracture surfaces and identified a dominate ductile failure mode within all of the specimens; however, the amount of ductility reduced with smaller notch root radii. While this study provides the initial notch responses of the L-PBF Inconel 718, further research must be completed in regard to the impact of notches on more complex loading behaviors, such as fatigue and stress-rupture conditions.},

ABSTRACT = {In shield tunneling projects, the selection of an accurate model to calculate the mechanical response of segment structure plays a crucial role in the design and cost of the project. The shell–spring and beam–spring models are two widely used methods for this purpose. However, it is still not clear how accurate and different these models are in calculation results under surcharge load. Therefore, to accurately calculate the internal forces and deformation of the segment structure and clarify the difference between the two models’ results, the shell–spring and beam–spring models were established based on a subway shield tunnel project in Zhengzhou city. The reliability of the models was verified by comparing and analyzing the differences in deformation results between the models and field measurements. Furthermore, the safety of the segment structure was evaluated according to the ultimate bearing capacity of the normal section. The results declare that: (1) In the shell–spring model, the internal force gradually reduces from the edges towards the center of the segment width, and the shield segment exhibits a prominent non-plane strain state. (2) The internal force of the beam–spring model is larger than that of the shell–spring model. The axial force difference between the two models is relatively small; meanwhile, there is a larger disparity in the bending moment. However, with an increase in surcharge loading, the discrepancy in internal forces between the two models gradually decreases. (3) The calculation results of the shell–spring model are close to the field-measured values and the shield tunnel model test values, which verifies the accuracy and reliability of the shell–spring model. Therefore, it is more reasonable to use the shell–spring model to calculate the mechanical response of the segment structure. (4) With an increase in surcharge loading, the safety of the shield tunnel decreases gradually. Therefore, surcharge loading above the shield tunnel should be reasonably controlled to meet the requirements of the normal use of the shield segment. This manuscript aims to provide a reference for the future design and optimization of the shield tunnels’ lining structure.},

ABSTRACT = {In the wake of economic and population growth, increased wastewater production poses a challenge related to sewage sludge treatment, which is problematic given its high moisture content, amount, and hazardous characteristics. This study focuses on the hydrothermal carbonization of sewage sludge to produce carbonous material–hydrochar, which may be an alternative to fossil fuels. The effect of process parameters, namely, temperature (180, 240, 300 °C) and duration time (30, 90, 180 min), on hydrochar properties (proximate and ultimate analysis, heating values) and process performance were studied. Obtained results indicate and confirm that hydrothermal carbonization, especially temperature increase, improves the fuel properties of carbonized sewage sludge. The highest low heating value was obtained for hydrochar derived at 300 °C in 180 min (~23 MJ × kg−1). The highest energy gain was noted for hydrochar derived at 240 °C in 180 min (~23%). As well as relatively high mass and energy yield in comparison to other hydrochars, these parameters are considered the most favorable for sewage sludge hydrothermal carbonization. However, high energy consumption (over 1300 kJ × g−1) suggests that more research on the process’s economical efficacy is required.},

ABSTRACT = {Thermal fatigue cracks occurring in pipes in nuclear power plants pose a high degree of risk. Thermal fatigue cracks are generated when the thermal fatigue load caused by local temperature gradients is repeatedly applied. The flaws are mainly found in welds, owing to the effects of stress concentration caused by the material properties and geometric shapes of welds. Thermal fatigue pipes are classified as targets of risk-informed in-service inspection, for which ultrasonic testing, a volumetric non-destructive testing method, is applied. With the advancement of ultrasonic testing techniques, various studies have been conducted recently to apply the phased array ultrasonic testing (PAUT) method to the inspection of thermal fatigue cracks occurring on pipes. A quantitative reliability analysis of the PAUT method must be performed to apply the PAUT method to on-site thermal fatigue crack inspection. In this study, to evaluate the quantitative reliability of the PAUT method for thermal fatigue cracks, we fabricated crack specimens with the thermal fatigue mechanism applied to the pipe welds. We performed a round-robin test to collect PAUT data and determine the validity of the detection performance (probability of detection; POD) and the error in the sizing accuracy (root-mean-square error; RMSE) evaluation. The analysis results of the POD and sizing performance of the length and depth of thermal fatigue cracks were comparatively evaluated with the acceptance criteria of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers Code to confirm the effectiveness of applying the PAUT method.},

ABSTRACT = {This work presents how significantly the proper selection of the magnetization method can improve almost all parameters of the magnetic method and affect the effectiveness of the evaluation of reinforced concrete (RC) structures. Three magnetization methods are considered in this paper: opposite pole magnetization (typical solution), same pole magnetization, and (as a reference point) no magnetization. The experiments are carried out in a three-dimensional (XYZ) space. Measurements along each of the axes are discussed in a separate section. The results show that the appropriate selection of the magnetization method can affect noise reduction, signal strength, and the separation of measurements carried out on different samples. This paper also discusses the situations when the magnetization may change the shape, cause deformations of waveforms, affect the area testing, and be used to significantly increase the efficiency of simultaneous evaluation of three basic parameters of RC structure. Experiments and simulations have proven that properly applied magnetization may strongly affect the evaluation’s effectiveness, making the magnetic method one of the most promising techniques in testing RC constructions.},

ABSTRACT = {This study investigates the internal architecture of Asian hornet nests (AHNs) using advanced imaging techniques, such as CT scanning and X-ray radiography, to understand their construction and function. The primary objective and significance of this study centre on drawing inspiration from the creative way Asian hornets construct their nests, with a particular focus on the architecture, design, functionality, and building materials of these nests. The architectural principles governing the construction of these nests, such as the arrangement of hexagonal cells, pedicels for load bearing, and adhesive materials, serve as a source of inspiration for innovative and sustainable design practices. The pedicels in Asian hornet nests play a crucial role in transferring load and ensuring stability. Additionally, AHNs’ adhesion to tree branches is essential for preventing collapse, and the pedicels provide necessary structural support. The knowledge gained from studying AHNs’ internal architecture could be applied directly to the architecture and civil engineering fields to improve structure stability and durability. The microstructure analysis of the paper-like material that hornets produce to build their nests indicates a complex and heterogeneous structure, composed of various plant fragments and fibres. This unique composition creates intricate grooves and pores, which are essential for regulating temperature and humidity levels within the outer envelope of the nest. The study of Asian hornet nests’ internal structure demonstrated that nature’s engineering principles inspire the design of durable and resilient structures in the construction industry. Civil engineers can incorporate similar principles into their designs to enhance the structural integrity and performance of buildings, bridges, and other infrastructure.},

ABSTRACT = {Biofilms, mainly comprised of bacteria, form on materials’ surfaces due to bacterial activity. They are generally composed of water, extracellular polymeric substances (polysaccharides, proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids), and bacteria. Some bacteria that form biofilms cause periodontal disease, corrosion of the metal materials that make up drains, and slippage. Inside of a biofilm is an environment conducive to the growth and propagation of bacteria. Problems with biofilms include the inability of disinfectants and antibiotics to act on them. Therefore, we have investigated the potential application of alternating electromagnetic fields for biofilm control. We obtained exciting results using various materials’ specimens and frequency conditions. Through these studies, we gradually understood that the combination of the type of bacteria, the kind of material, and the application of an electromagnetic field with various low frequencies (4 kHz–12 kHz) changes the circumstances of the onset of the biofilm suppression effect. In this study, relatively high frequencies (20 and 30 kHz) were applied to biofilms caused by Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epidermidis), and quantitative evaluation was performed using staining methods. The sample surfaces were analyzed by Raman spectroscopy using a Laser Raman spectrometer to confirm the presence of biofilms on the surface.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper investigated evolutions of α-Al sub-grains’ morphology and crystalline orientation in the fusion zone during laser welding of 2A12 aluminum alloys. Based on this, a new method for assessing the weldability of materials was proposed. In laser deep-penetration welding, in addition to the conventional columnar and equiaxed dendrites, there also exhibited a corrugated structure with several ‘fine-coarse-fine’ transformations. In such regions, an abnormal α-Al coarsening phenomenon was encountered, with a more dispersed crystalline orientation arrangement and a decreased maximum pole density value. Particularly, structural alterations appeared more frequently in the weld bottom than the top. The above results indicated that the laser-induced keyhole presented a continually fluctuating state. Under such a condition, the solid–liquid transformation exhibited an unstable solidification front, a fluctuant undercooling, and a variational solidification rate. Meanwhile, the welding quality of this material is in a critical state to generate pores. Therefore, the appearance and relevant number of corrugated regions can be considered as a new way for judging the weldability, which will help to narrow the processing window with better welding stability.},

ABSTRACT = {Controllable bonded prestress represents an innovative advancement stemming from retard-bonded prestress systems, distinguished by its intrinsic controllability in bonding. The controllable bonded binder can be artificially heated and cured rapidly through DC heating after the completion of prestressed tension, allowing for enhanced control over the process. FLUENT simulates controllable bonded prestressed structure’s temperature field, yielding a 1.73% max error validated against measured data. Based on the theory of heat transfer, the maximum error of the calculated temperature field of the controllable bonded test beam under DC heating using the Stehfest numerical algorithm is 1.28%, which exhibits a strong alignment with both simulated and measured results. The parameter analysis identifies current, binder thickness, and steel-strand diameter as key temperature distribution influencers. The relationship between the current and heating time follows a quadratic inverse pattern. Increasing the heating current can significantly reduce the duration of heating. Under identical heating conditions, the temperature of the controllable binder is directly proportional to its thickness. A higher thickness results in a higher temperature. Additionally, larger diameters of steel-stranded wire lead to a lower heating efficiency.},

ABSTRACT = {Although nondestructive ultrasonic technologies have been applied in laboratory and field tests in the field of heritage conservation, few studies have quantified the relationship among the real microstructures, micromechanical properties, and macroscopic acoustic responses of earthen-site soils. This paper develops a micromechanics-based multiscale model for quantitatively exploring the ultrasonic propagation characteristics of elastic waves in untreated and consolidated earthen-site soils. Scanning electron microscope images and image processing technology are integrated into the finite-element simulation. The effects of microstructure and wave features on the acoustic characteristics of soils are quantitatively investigated under pulsive loading. The simulation results of untreated and consolidated soils are efficiently compared to ultrasonic test data. It is demonstrated that the integration of microstructure image processing and multiscale modeling can predict the ultrasonic pulse velocity well, which improves the accuracy of laboratory testing and field monitoring and better serves the evaluation and implementation of engineering practice in the field of heritage conservation.},

ABSTRACT = {This study investigates a sustainable alternative for composites and adhesives in high-performance industries like civil and automotive. This study pioneers the development and application of a new methodology to characterize a bio-based, zero-thickness adhesive. This method facilitates precise measurements of the adhesive’s strength and fracture properties under zero-thickness conditions. The research also encompasses the characterization of densified pine wood, an innovative wood product distinguished by enhanced mechanical properties, which is subsequently compared to natural pine wood. We conducted a comprehensive characterization of wood’s strength properties, utilizing dogbone-shaped samples in the fiber direction, and block specimens in the transverse direction. Butt joints were employed for adhesive testing. Mode I fracture properties were determined via compact tension (CT) and double cantilever beam (DCB) tests for wood and adhesive, respectively, while mode II response was assessed through end-loaded split (ELS) tests. The densification procedure, encompassing chemical and mechanical processes, was a focal point of the study. Initially, wood was subjected to acid boiling to remove the wood matrix, followed by the application of pressure to enhance density. As a result, wood density increased by approximately 100 percent, accompanied by substantial improvements in strength and fracture energy along the fiber direction by about 120 percent. However, it is worth noting that due to the delignification nature of the densification method, properties in the transverse direction, mainly reliant on the lignin matrix, exhibited compromises. Also introduced was an innovative technique to evaluate the bio-based adhesive, applied as a zero-thickness layer. The results from this method reveal promising mechanical properties, highlighting the bio-based adhesive’s potential as an eco-friendly substitute for synthetic adhesives in the wood industry.},

ABSTRACT = {The Moche civilization in Peru developed marvelous metallurgy, primarily using alloys of gold, copper and silver, with the most famous of them called Tumbaga, which resembles pure gold after a depletion process on its surface. However, they also created objects with more standard single-layer alloys or gilding. To distinguish between these techniques in a non-destructive manner is essential. Here, we analyzed a thigh protector, composed of two parts, one seemingly in silver and the other seemingly in gold. The sample was analyzed using X-ray fluorescence measurements integrated with Monte Carlo simulation. The results show that the silver part is formed of a silver-based alloy covered in a corrosion layer, while the gold part is made of Tumbaga. Moreover, for the first time, the gold profiles of different Tumbaga gold objects, from the same burial, were compared, allowing us to obtain information about the standardization of their manufacture.},

ABSTRACT = {The damage due to embrittlement of the sintering furnace belt and its replacement after a certain time of use represents a problem for the manufacturers of sintered parts. Finding out the reason for the damage could help to increase the duration of its operation. This research aimed to investigate the causes of embrittlement, considering both the temperatures and atmosphere of the sintering furnace to which the furnace belt is exposed during its operation. The furnace belt was made of AISI 314 stainless steel. Optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, combined with energy-dispersive X-ray analysis, X-ray diffraction and the Vickers hardness tests were used to analyze the microstructural, structural, compositional and hardness changes of the belt used for 45 weeks. Cr and Mn carbides, the oxides of Fe, Cr, Mn and Si were found to form at the edge of the furnace belt. The grains grew after 45 weeks of use, approximately 10 times, due to thermal cycles in an endothermic gas atmosphere to which the belt was exposed. Also, the hardness increased from 226 to 338 HV0.05, due to the formation of carbide and oxide-type compounds. All these results represent a starting point in optimizing the lifetime of the sintering furnace belt.},

ABSTRACT = {Composite materials are used in a substantial number of products. Environmental concerns highlight the need for the inclusion of recovered waste in their formulation, thus reducing their carbon footprint. These solutions raise the need to confirm the mechanical characteristics of these materials, avoiding unwanted failures. In this work, the authors present an experimental study on the drilling effects on fibrous–particulate hybrid composites made of glass/carbon fabrics and three different micro-inclusions: silica particles, recycled carbon fibre powder and cement. The mechanical features of the plates are confirmed by thrust force monitoring during drilling and by flexural testing. The range of results confirm the mechanical outcomes due to machining. The plates with monolithic carbon fabric or with carbon fabric plies in the outer plies returned higher mechanical characteristics. The plates with micro-inclusions had enhanced the flexural strength by 23% and 10%, in 40% and 60% fabric plates, respectively. The results demonstrate that the use of alternative formulations with micro-inclusions from recovered waste can contribute both to the reduction of the mechanical degradation of drilled hybrid composites and to environmental purposes by avoiding the increase in landfill waste.},

ABSTRACT = {Composites are materials that are widely used in industry, including yachting, railway and aviation. The properties of these materials can be modified by changing the type of reinforcement, the type of matrix, as well as the use of additives in the form of fillers and nanofillers that improve their mechanical or specific parameters. Due to the fact that these materials are often used for important structures, computational models using FEM tools may not be sufficient to determine the actual strength parameters, and what is more, to check them during operation. When designing structures made of composite materials, it is necessary to use high safety factors due to their behavior under several different types of loads, which is still difficult to determine precisely. This situation makes these structures much heavier and characterized by much higher strength properties than those that would actually be needed. In this article, the Kolmogorov-Sinai (K-S) metric entropy was used to determine the transition from the elastic to the viscoelastic state in GFRP (glass fiber reinforced polymer) composite materials without and with the addition of nanoaluminum, during a static tensile test. Additionally, the acoustic emission method was used during the research. This signal was further processed, and graphs were made of the number of events and the amplitude as a function of time. The obtained values were plotted on tensile graphs. The influence of the nano-filler on these parameters was also analyzed. The presented results show that it is possible to determine additional parameters affecting the strength of the structure for any composite materials.},

ABSTRACT = {With the development of the pressure vessel industry, high-energy wire welding has a great future. However, this means higher demands on the weldability of pressure vessel steels. Controlling inclusions via oxidative metallurgy is a reliable method of improving the weldability of pressure vessel steels. Hence, in this paper, experimental steels with different Mg element mass fractions were prepared using vacuum metallurgy. Simulated welding for high-heat input welding was carried out using the Gleeble-2000 welding thermal simulation test machine. The inclusions in the welding heat-affected zone (HAZ) in the experimental steels were observed using an optical microscope (OM) and scanning electron microscope (SEM). The compositions of the inclusions were analyzed using an energy-dispersive spectrometer (EDS). The research results indicated that the addition of Mg could increase the number density of the inclusions in the welding HAZ. With the addition of Mg from 0 to 5 wt.%, the total number density of the inclusions increased from 133 to 687 pieces/mm2, and the number density of the inclusions with a size of 0–5 μm2 increased from 122 to 579 pieces/mm2. The inclusions in the experimental steel welding HAZ with Mg elements were mainly elliptical composite inclusions composed of (Mg-Zr-O) + MnS. Moreover, MnS precipitated on the surface of the Mg-containing inclusions in the welding HAZ. Intragranular acicular ferrite (IAF) nucleation was primarily induced via the minimum lattice mismatch mechanism, supplemented with stress-strain energy and inert interface energy mechanisms.},

ABSTRACT = {Biofilm infections sometimes occur on biomaterials inserted into the body because biomaterials can block the attack of immune cells such as macrophages, promoting biofilm formation by invading bacteria. Owing to their use in antifouling applications, including biofilm formation, siloxane-based polymer coatings are considered a promising method to prevent biofilm formation on the surface of biomaterials. In this study, we explored the antibiofilm property and biocompatibility of siloxane-based polymer coatings. Biofilm formation and cytotoxicity tests were performed using Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus epidermidis to quantify the biofilms while U937 cells were used to measure the time course of viable cell concentration and viability, respectively. In both the biofilm formation and cytotoxicity tests, stainless steel SUS316L plates and titanium plates coated with the siloxane-based polymer and sterilized in an autoclave were used as the biomaterials. The amount of biofilm formed on the polymer-coated titanium plate was substantially higher than that on a noncoated titanium plate in the case of S. epidermidis. The viable cell concentration and viability of U937 cultured on the polymer-coated titanium plate were lower than those of U937 cultured on the noncoated titanium plate. The same trend was observed between polymer-coated and noncoated SUS316L plates. These results indicate that the siloxane-based polymer coatings need additional treatment to achieve a satisfactory antibiofilm property and that they are sensitive to autoclave treatment, resulting in cytotoxicity.},

ABSTRACT = {Shot peening is a surface treatment process that improves the fatigue life of a material and suppresses cracks by generating residual stress on the surface. The injected small shots create a compressive residual stress layer on the material’s surface. Maximum compressive residual stress occurs at a certain depth, and tensile residual stress gradually occurs as the depth increases. This process is primarily used for nickel-based superalloy steel materials in certain environments, such as the aerospace industry and nuclear power fields. To prevent such a severe accident due to the high-temperature and high-pressure environment, evaluating the residual stress of shot-peened materials is essential in evaluating the soundness of the material. Representative methods for evaluating residual stress include perforation strain gauge analysis, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and ultrasonic testing. Among them, ultrasonic testing is a representative, non-destructive evaluation method, and residual stress can be estimated using a Rayleigh wave. Therefore, in this study, the maximum compressive residual stress value of the peened Inconel 718 specimen was predicted using a prediction convolutional neural network (CNN) based on the relationship between Rayleigh wave dispersion and stress distribution on the specimen. By analyzing the residual stress distribution in the depth direction generated in the model from various studies in the literature, 173 residual stress distributions were generated using the Gaussian function and factorial design approach. The distribution generated using the relationship was converted into 173 Rayleigh wave dispersion data to be used as a database for the CNN model. The CNN model was learned through this database, and performance was verified using validation data. The adopted Rayleigh wave dispersion and convolutional neural network procedures demonstrate the ability to predict the maximum compressive residual stress in the peened specimen.},

ABSTRACT = {The precise control and understanding of heat flow in heterostructures is pivotal for advancements in thermoelectric energy conversion, thermal barrier coatings, and efficient heat management in electronic and optoelectronic devices. In this study, we employ high-angular-resolution time-resolved X-ray diffraction to structurally measure thermal resistance in a laser-excited AlGaAs/GaAs semiconductor heterostructure. Our methodology offers femtometer-scale spatial sensitivity and nanosecond time resolution, enabling us to directly observe heat transport across a buried interface. We corroborate established Thermal Boundary Resistance (TBR) values for AlGaAs/GaAs heterostructures and demonstrate that TBR arises from material property discrepancies on either side of a nearly flawless atomic interface. This work not only sheds light on the fundamental mechanisms governing heat flow across buried interfaces but also presents a robust experimental framework that can be extended to other heterostructure systems, paving the way for optimized thermal management in next-generation devices.},

Structural, magnetic, and electrical studies have shown that a reduction in CuCr2Se4 single crystals to the nanosize leads to (1) a weakening of ferromagnetic interactions, both long and short range, (2) a lack of saturation of magnetization at 5 K and 70 kOe, (3) a change in the nature of electrical conductivity from metallic to semiconductor, and (4) a reduction in the thermoelectric power factor S2σ by an order of magnitude of 400 K. The above results were considered in terms of the parameters of the band model, derived from the high-temperature expansion of magnetic susceptibility and from the diffusive component of thermoelectric power. Theoretical calculations showed a significant weakening of both the superexchange and double exchange mechanisms, a reduction in the [Cr3+,Cr4+] band width from 0.76 to 0.19 eV, and comparable values of the Fermi energy and the activation energy (0.46 eV) in the intrinsic region of electrical conductivity. The main advantage of high-energy ball milling is the ability to modify the physicochemical properties of already existing compounds for desired applications.},

ABSTRACT = {By applying the physical vapour deposition method, hollow ceramic microspheres were coated with titanium, and subsequently, they were sintered using the spark plasma sintering technique to create a porous ceramic material that is lightweight and devoid of a matrix. The sintering process was carried out at temperatures ranging from 1050 to 1200 °C, with a holding time of 2 min. The samples were subjected to conventional thermal analyses (differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetry, dilatometry), oxidation resistance tests, and thermal diffusivity measurements. Phase analysis of the samples was performed using the XRD and the microstructure of the prepared specimens was examined using electron microscopy. The titanium coating on the microspheres increased the compressive strength and density of the resulting ceramic material as the sintering temperature increased. The morphology of the samples was carefully examined, and phase transitions were also identified during the analysis of the samples.},

ABSTRACT = {Porous carbon materials have been widely used to remove pollutants from the liquid-phase streams. However, their limited pore properties could be a major problem. In this work, the effects of post-washing methods (i.e., water washing and acid washing) on the textural characteristics of the resulting biochar and activated carbon products from pineapple peel biomass were investigated in the carbonization and CO2 activation processes. The experiments were set at an elevated temperature (i.e., 800 °C) holding for 30 min. It was found that the enhancement in pore property reached about a 50% increase rate, increasing from 569.56 m2/g for the crude activated carbon to the maximal BET surface area of 843.09 m2/g for the resulting activated carbon by water washing. The resulting activated carbon materials featured the microporous structures but also were characteristic of the mesoporous solids. By contrast, the enhancement in the increase rate by about 150% was found in the resulting biochar products. However, there seemed to be no significant variations in pore property with post-washing methods. Using the energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and the Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analyses, it showed some oxygen-containing functional groups or complexes, potentially posing the hydrophilic characters on the surface of the resulting carbon materials.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper presents the mechanical behavior of thermally sprayed coatings produced using an arc wire coating material. The produced coatings were cut and subjected to strength resistance tests in static and in dynamic loading. The compressive behavior for the strain rates between 0.001 1/s and 2612 1/s was examined. The strain rate sensitivity of the material was recognized in the material during dynamic loading using the SHPB technique. Microstructural observations were made, and properties such as changes in porosity and the microhardness of the coatings tested were examined. A significant reduction in coating porosity was demonstrated after static loading (90%) and dynamic loading (86%). The result of porosity reduction is the strengthening of the coatings through an increase in the microhardness of these coatings after loading in the static test (160 HV 0.3/8) and the dynamic test (278 HV 0.3/8). As a result of the tests, the coatings retain their cohesion and remain consistent. At the same time, they can absorb a significant amount of mechanical energy due to plastic deformation and porosity reduction. The presented results concern a completely new coating material created from a core wire.},

ABSTRACT = {Sewage and water networks are crucial infrastructures of modern urban society. The uninterrupted functionality of these networks is paramount, necessitating regular maintenance and rehabilitation. In densely populated urban areas, trenchless methods, particularly those employing cured-in-place pipe technology, have emerged as the most cost-efficient approach for network rehabilitation. Common diagnostic methods for assessing pipe conditions, whether original or retrofitted with-cured-in-place pipes, typically include camera examination or laser scans, and are limited in material characterization. This study introduces three innovative methods for characterizing critical aspects of pipe conditions. The impact-echo method, ground-penetrating radar, and impedance spectroscopy address the challenges posed by polymer liners and offer enhanced accuracy in defect detection. These methods enable the characterization of delamination, identification of caverns behind cured-in-place pipes, and evaluation of overall pipe health. A machine learning algorithm using deep learning on images acquired from impact-echo signals using continuous wavelet transformation is presented to characterize defects. The aim is to compare traditional machine learning and deep learning methods to characterize selected pipe defects. The measurement conducted with ground-penetrating radar is depicted, employing a heuristic algorithm to estimate caverns behind the tested polymer composites. This study also presents results obtained through impedance spectroscopy, employed to characterize the delamination of polymer liners caused by uneven curing. A comparative analysis of these methods is conducted, assessing the accuracy by comparing the known positions of defects with their predicted characteristics based on laboratory measurements.},

ABSTRACT = {DyMnO3 is a p-type semiconductor oxide with two crystal systems, orthorhombic and hexagonal. This material highlights its ferroelectric and ferromagnetic properties, which have been the subject of numerous studies. Nevertheless, its photocatalytic activity has been less explored. In this work, the photocatalytic activity of DyMnO3 is evaluated through the photodegradation of MG dye. For the synthesis of this oxide, a novel and effective method was used: polymer-decomposition. The synthesized powders contain an orthorhombic phase, with a range of absorbances from 300 to 500 nm and a band gap energy of 2.4 eV. It is also highlighted that, when using this synthesis method, some of the main diffraction lines related to the orthorhombic phase appear at 100 °C. Regarding its photocatalytic activity, it was evaluated under visible light (λ = 405 nm), reaching a photodegradation of approximately 88% in a period of 30 min. Photocurrent tests reveal a charge carrier separation (e−,h+) at a 405 nm wavelength. The main reactive oxygen species (ROS) involved in the photodegradation process were radicals, OH•, and photo-holes (h+). These results stand out because it is the first time that the photodegradation capability of this oxide in the visible spectrum has been evaluated.},

ABSTRACT = {Composites consisting of iron aluminide and iron silicide phases were studied in this work. Powders of iron aluminide and iron silicide were prepared by mechanical alloying separately. Subsequently, they were blended in three different proportions and sintered by the SPS method under various conditions. After sintering, the composites are composed of FeAl and amounts of other silicides (Fe5Si3 and Fe3Si). Ternary Fe–Al–Si phases were not determined, even though their presence was predicted by DFT calculations. This disagreement was explained by steric factors, i.e., by differences in the space lattice of the present phases. Hardness and tribological properties were measured on composites with various weight ratios of iron aluminide and iron silicide. The results show that sintered silicides with the matrix composed of iron aluminide reach comparable hardness to tool steels. The composites with higher mass ratios of iron aluminide than silicide have higher hardness and better tribological properties.},

ABSTRACT = {A standardized preparation process is proposed in this study for achieving optimal strength and vegetative properties in vegetated concrete, using Yunnan red soil as a growth substrate for plants. The porosity of vegetated concrete is a crucial factor influencing plant growth, while compressive strength is a significant mechanical property. To assess the strength and porosity of vegetated concrete, different design porosities (22%, 24%, 26%, 28%) and cement-to-aggregate ratios (4, 5, 6, 7) were utilized in the preparation of vegetated concrete samples. The shell-making and static-pressure-molding methods were optimized for specimen preparation. Analyzing the stress–strain full curve characteristics of vegetation-type concrete under different influencing factors, an in-depth investigation into its failure mechanism was conducted. It was determined that the design porosity and cement content significantly impact the concrete’s performance, particularly in terms of 30-day compressive strength and effective porosity. Furthermore, an increase in the fly ash ratio led to an increase in porosity and a decrease in compressive strength, providing a certain guidance for optimizing concrete performance. Comparative analysis through vegetation experiments revealed that black rye grass exhibited favorable growth adaptability compared to other grass species.},

ABSTRACT = {Ti–(50−x)Ni–xFe alloys exhibit a thermally induced B2–R martensitic transformation (MT) when x is between 1.5% and 5.7%, whereas this transformation is suppressed when x is 6 at% and higher. We studied the reason for this suppression by applying compressive stress in the [110]B2 direction to single-crystalline Ti–44Ni–6Fe and Ti–42Ni–8Fe (at%) alloys. Under stress, these alloys exhibit a B2–R MT with a large temperature hysteresis of ≥50 K. The B2–R MT in these alloys is probably thermally arrested, and a small entropy change is a possible reason for this arrest. The Young’s modulus E[110] of these alloys significantly decreases with decreasing temperature, and the B2–R MT under stress occurs at a temperature where E[110] is approximately 50 GPa. Presumably, lattice softening assists the B2–R MT.},

ABSTRACT = {High-density polyethylene (HDPE) pipes are becoming increasingly popular, being used in various fields, such as construction, marine, petroleum, water transfer, process water, methane gas collection, oil and gas gathering, gas distribution systems, mining, acid and wet gas lines, offshore oil and gas and in nuclear power plants. Higher-order guided Lamb wave (UGW) modes can be used to detect various defects in complex structures. We will apply this methodology to one of the types of plastic—the structure of high-density polyethylene (HDPE). However, the excitation of UGW modes faces numerous challenges, especially when there is a need to identify which mode is excited. It is essential to note that, in the higher frequency range, multiple different higher-order modes can usually be excited. This can make it difficult to determine which modes have actually been excited. The objective of this research was to successfully excite and receive various higher-order UGW modes in high-density polyethylene structures using both ultrasonic single-element transducers and a phased array. Theoretical calculations were performed using a variety of methods: semi-analytical finite element (SAFE) method, 2D spatial–temporal spectrum analysis and finite element modeling (FEM). The results obtained from both measurements and simulations clearly demonstrate the possibility of efficiently exciting and receiving different Lamb wave modes possessing different phase velocities.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper presents the results of inspecting tensile stress-loaded GFRP (glass fiber-reinforced polymer) samples using the Magnetic Recording Method (MRM). The MRM can be utilized solely to examine ferromagnetic materials. The modification was proposed in order to examine nonmagnetic composites. Ferromagnetic strips made of low-carbon steel DC01 were bonded to the surface using an adhesive composed of epoxy resin with the addition of triethylenetetramine. The modified method’s feasibility was tested on six samples made of GFRP. The research procedure consisted of three steps. In the first step, a metal strip is glued at the top surface of each sample, and an array of 100 cylindrical permanent magnets is used to record a sinusoidal magnetic pattern on the strip. The initial residual magnetization is measured in the second step, and the samples are subjected to static stress. In the third step, the residual magnetization is measured one more time. Ultimately, the measurement results from the second and third steps are compared. Generally, the applied stress causes changes in the amplitude and frequency of the sinusoidal magnetization pattern. In the case of GFRP, the frequency changes have not been used for evaluation due to minimal variations. The statistical parameters (mean, median, max, and mode) of the RMS (root mean square) value of the sinusoidal pattern were calculated and analyzed. The analysis demonstrates that the modified method is suitable for providing unequivocal and exact information on the load applied to a nonmagnetic composite material. For the presented results, the applied load can be assessed unambiguously for the samples elongated up to 0.6%.},

ABSTRACT = {Thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) composites with eutectic gallium (Ga) and indium (In) (eGaIn) fillings of 0 wt%–75 wt% were prepared using the electrostatic spinning method. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy were used to characterize the eGaIn NDs/TPU composites. To evaluate their X-ray shielding properties, Phy-X/PSD and WinXCom were employed to calculate the mass attenuation coefficients, linear attenuation coefficients, half-value layers, tenth value layers, mean free paths, and adequate atomic numbers of the eGaIn NDs/TPU composites. The SEM results indicated that the eGaIn nanodroplets were evenly distributed throughout the TPU fibers, and the flowable eGaIn was well-suited for interfacial compatibility with the TPU. A comparison of the eGaIn NDs/TPU composites with different content levels showed that the composite with 75 wt% eGaIn had the highest μm at all the evaluated energies, indicating a superior ability to attenuate X-rays. This non-toxic, lightweight, and flexible composite is a potential material for shielding against medical diagnostic X-rays.},

ABSTRACT = {In welded maraging steels, mechanical properties, particularly ductility and toughness, are often compromised in the heat-affected zone (HAZ). This study focuses on 300-grade maraging steel bars, solution annealed at 1123 K for 1.5 h (5.4 ks) and welded using gas tungsten arc welding, followed by a post-weld heat treatment at 753 K for 13.33 h (48 ks). In situ observations during three-point bending tests on HAZ samples featuring coarsened prior austenite grain sizes were conducted to examine damage behavior and the crack path near the crack tip. The main crack initiated at the peak applied load during the bending test and, upon further loading, exhibited significant deflection and extension accompanied by numerous microcracks and localized crack branching. Distinctive damage features, such as transgranular cracking across block regions, intense intergranular cracking along packet boundaries with a pronounced shear component, and crowding of microcracks ahead of the crack tip, were observed in the HAZ sample during the in situ test. The interaction between the main crack tip and microcracks and its influence on the local crack propagation driving force was discussed using fracture mechanics. Experimental results, including tensile fracture surface observations and in situ images, along with analysis of the stress anti-shielding effect by microcracks, suggest that the HAZ sample exhibits embrittlement fracture behavior with lower ductility and toughness compared to the base metal sample.},

Using fracture tests and time series analysis of AE signals, parameters such as b-value, improved b-value (Ib-value), and energy b-value (be-value) were examined to understand crack initiation, growth, and structural failure. The stress–strain curve revealed distinct responses during tensile and step loading, and time series analysis highlighted variations in amplitude, AE energy, and Kaiser and Felicity effects. Under tensile loading, the Ib-value exhibited a linear decrease, while step loading introduced complexities, including the Felicity effect. The be-value, incorporating energy considerations, fluctuated, providing insights into micro-cracks and macro-cracks. Statistical analysis demonstrated a consistent decrease in the be-value, emphasizing its potential for long-term monitoring. This study provides a comprehensive technique for assessing composite material fracture behavior, enhancing understanding for critical applications in hydrogen storage vessels and pressure pipes as well as advancing reliability and safety in industrial sectors.},

ABSTRACT = {Experiments were conducted to reveal the nanostructure evolution in additively manufactured (AMed) 316L stainless steel due to severe plastic deformation (SPD). SPD-processing was carried out using the high-pressure torsion (HPT) technique. HPT was performed on four different states of 316L: the as-built material and specimens heat-treated at 400, 800 and 1100 °C after AM-processing. The motivation for the extension of this research to the annealed states is that heat treatment is a usual step after 3D printing in order to reduce the internal stresses formed during AM-processing. The nanostructure was studied by X-ray line profile analysis (XLPA), which was completed by crystallographic texture measurements. It was found that the as-built 316L sample contained a considerable density of dislocations (1015 m−2), which decreased to about half the original density due to the heat treatments at 800 and 1100 °C. The hardness varied accordingly during annealing. Despite this difference caused by annealing, HPT processing led to a similar evolution of the microstructure by increasing the strain for the samples with and without annealing. The saturation values of the crystallite size, dislocation density and twin fault probability were about 20 nm, 3 × 1016 m−2 and 3%, respectively, while the maximum achievable hardness was ~6000 MPa. The initial <100> and <110> textures for the as-built and the annealed samples were changed to <111> due to HPT processing.},

The aim of this study was to investigate the physico-mechanical performance of composites based on AAFA binders and the effect of different types of aggregates on these properties. The experimental results indicate variations in flexural and compressive strength, which are influenced both by the nature and particle size distribution of aggregates and the binder-to-aggregate ratio. The analysis of the samples highlighted changes in porosity, both in distribution and pore size, depending on the nature of the aggregates. This supports the evolution of physico-mechanical performance indicators.},

ABSTRACT = {Hydrosphere pollution by organic pollutants of different nature (persistent dyes, phenols, herbicides, antibiotics, etc.) is one of the urgent ecological problems facing humankind these days. The task of water purification from such pollutants can be effectively solved with the help of modern photocatalytic technologies. This article is devoted to the study of photocatalytic properties of composite catalysts based on ZnO modified with plasmonic Ag nanoparticles. All materials were obtained by laser synthesis in liquid and differed by their silver content and preparation conditions, such as additional laser irradiation and/or annealing of produced powders. The prepared ZnO-Ag powders were investigated by electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and UV-Vis spectroscopy. Photocatalytic tests were carried out with well- known test molecules in water (persistent dye rhodamine B, phenol and common antibiotic tetracycline) using LED light sources with wavelengths of 375 and 410 nm. The introduction of small concentrations (up to 1%) of plasmonic Ag nanoparticles is shown to increase the efficiency of the ZnO photocatalyst by expanding its spectral range. Both the preparation conditions and material composition were optimized to obtain composite photocatalysts with the highest efficiency. Finally, the operation mechanisms of the material with different distribution of silver are discussed.},

ABSTRACT = {Valorization of high-volume mine tailings could be achieved by the development of new geopolymers with a low CO2 footprint. Materials rich in aluminum and silicon with appropriate solubility in an alkaline medium can be used to obtain a geopolymer. This paper presents a study of copper mine tailings from Bulgaria as precursors for geopolymers. Particle size distribution, chemical and mineralogical composition, as well as alkaline reactivity, acidity and electroconductivity of aqueous slurry are studied. The heavy metal content and their mobility are studied by leaching tests. Sequential extraction was applied to determine the geochemical phase distribution of heavy metals. The studied samples were characterized by high alkalinity, which could favor the geopolymerization process. The water-soluble sulphates were less than 4%. The Si/Al ratio in mine tailing was found to be 3. The alkaline reactivity depended more so on the time of extraction than on the concentration of NaOH solution. The main part of the heavy metals was found in the residual fraction; hence, in high alkaline medium during the geopolymerization process, they will stay fixed. Thus, the obtained geopolymers could be expected to exert low environmental impact. The presented results revealed that studied copper mine tailing is a suitable precursor for geopolymerization.},

ABSTRACT = {The main strengthening mechanism for Inconel 718 (IN718), a Ni-based superalloy, is precipitation hardening by γ′ and γ″ particles. It is thus essential, for good alloy performance, that precipitates with the desired chemical composition have adequate size and dispersion. The distribution of the γ′ and γ″ phases and their chemical composition were investigated in the nickel-based Inconel 718 superalloy by taking advantage of the new capabilities of scanning transmission electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry using a windowless multiple detector, a high-brightness Schottky electron gun, and a spherical aberration corrector in the illumination probe optics. A small routine was developed to deconvolute the respective compositions of γ′ and γ″ nanoprecipitates embedded in the γ matrix. Keeping the electron probe current low enough—a few hundred pA—prevented excessive irradiation damage during the acquisition of element maps and brought their spatial resolution down to the atomic column level to track their element compositions. The present results agree with and complement atomic probe tomography observations and Thermo-Calc predictions from the literature. The presence of an Al enrichment at the γ′/γ″ interface—which may control the γ″ phase coarsening—is observed in the last row of Al-Nb-Ti columns along this interface. In addition, a few columns with similar composition changes are found randomly distributed in the γ′ phase.},

ABSTRACT = {In this study, we demonstrated the effective separation of charge carriers within the IGZO/IZO heterostructure by incorporating IZO. We have chosen IGZO for its high mobility and excellent on–off switching behavior in the front channel of our oxide–oxide heterostructure. Similarly, for an additional oxide layer, we have selected IZO due to its outstanding electrical properties. The optimized optoelectronic characteristics of the IGZO/IZO phototransistors were identified by adjusting the ratio of In:Zn in the IZO layer. As a result, the most remarkable traits were observed at the ratio of In:Zn = 8:2. Compared to the IGZO single-layer phototransistor, the IGZO/IZO(8:2) phototransistor showed improved photoresponse characteristics, with photosensitivity and photoresponsivity values of 1.00 × 107 and 89.1 AW−1, respectively, under visible light wavelength illumination. Moreover, the electrical characteristics of the IGZO/IZO(8:2) transistor, such as field effect mobility (μsat) and current on/off ratio (Ion/Ioff), were highly enhanced compared to the IGZO transistor. The μsat and Ion/Ioff were increased by about 2.1 times and 2.3 times, respectively, compared to the IGZO transistor. This work provides an approach for fabricating visible-light phototransistors with elevated optoelectronic properties and low power consumption based on an oxide–oxide heterostructure. The phototransistor with improved performance can be applied to applications such as color-selective visible-light image sensors and biometric sensors interacting with human–machine interfaces.},

ABSTRACT = {In this study, as a novel approach to thin-film solar cells based on tin sulfide, an environmentally friendly material, we attempted to fabricate (Ge, Sn)S thin films for application in multi-junction solar cells. A (Ge0.42 Sn0.58)S thin film was prepared via co-evaporation. The (Ge0.42 Sn0.58)S thin film formed a (Ge, Sn)S solid solution, as confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectroscopy analyses. The open circuit voltage (Voc), short circuit current density (Jsc), fill factor (FF), and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of (Ge0.42 Sn0.58)S thin-film solar cells were 0.29 V, 6.92 mA/cm2, 0.34, and 0.67%, respectively; moreover, the device showed a band gap of 1.42–1.52 eV. We showed that solar cells can be realized even in a composition range with a relatively higher Ge concentration than the (Ge, Sn)S solar cells reported to date. This result enhances the feasibility of multi-junction SnS-system thin-film solar cells.},

ABSTRACT = {Unsymmetrical disulfides, in which different organic groups are bonded to disulfide bonds, have been synthesized by cross-coupling reactions using thiols as substrates. However, due to the low-binding energy of unsymmetrical disulfides, its disproportionation occurs based on the side reactions with nucleophilic thiols, resulting in the impurity of symmetric disulfides. In this study, we developed a solvent-free synthesis method for unsymmetrical disulfides using thiosulfonates, thiols, and a base. This synthetic method enabled us to obtain highly pure diaryl-substituted unsymmetrical disulfides with particularly low-binding energy without control over the nucleophilicity and elimination properties of the substrate. Furthermore, it was observed that the disproportionation of unsymmetrical disulfides occurred in the solvent. This means that solvent-free condition is one of the factors to obtain unsymmetrical disulfides. As a new application of unsymmetrical disulfides, we applied unsymmetrical disulfides to cathode active materials of lithium batteries based on the reversible multi-electron redox activity of S–S bonds. The batteries using unsymmetrical disulfide cathode-active materials with a carbon nanotube exhibited initial capacities of 127 and 158 Ah/kg, equal to 42 and 53% of their theoretical ones. We demonstrated that unsymmetrical disulfides could be used as cathode-active materials for rechargeable batteries.},

For instance, in porous periodic nacre-like microstructures, microscopic and macroscopic instabilities may occur for a given uniaxial loading process and, as a consequence, wave attenuation properties may evolve as a function of the microstructural evolution, designating it as metamaterials. The numerical outcomes provide new opportunities to design bioinspired, soft composite metamaterials characterized by high deformability and enhanced elastic wave attenuation capabilities given by the insertion of voids and lead cores.},

ABSTRACT = {Common walkingstick (Diapheromera femorata) aqueous extract (CWSAE) can induce the synthesis of useful bionanomaterials. CWSAE is rich in water-soluble organic compounds such as proteins and polypeptides that function as reducing/stabilizing agents for nanoparticle formation from Ag+ ion precursors. The synthesized AgNPs exhibited a moderately uniform size, with the majority falling within the range of 20–80 nm. These AgNPs were UV-treated and tested as antibacterial agents to inhibit the growth of four pathogenic bacteria (Burkholderia cenocepacia K-56, Klebsiella pneumoniae ST258, Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1, and Staphylococcus aureus USA300), as well as one common bacterium (Escherichia coli BW25113). The disk diffusion test demonstrated that the UV-treated AgNPs significantly and selectively inhibited the growth of Staphylococcus aureus USA300 and P. aeruginosa, while showing a small effect on the other two species. This suggests the potential application of green-chemically synthesized AgNPs as selective antibacterial agents. Furthermore, we studied the effects of short-term (1–2 min) and long-term (5–30 min) UV treatment on the selective cytotoxicity of the AgNPs and found that the cytotoxicity of the AgNPs could depend on the duration of UV exposure against certain bacteria.},

ABSTRACT = {The stress distribution in prestressed filament wound components plays a crucial role in determining the quality of these components during their operational lifespan. This article proposes a physical model to analyze the stress and deformation of prestressed wound composite components with arch-shaped sections. Drawing upon the principles of beam theory, we delve into the analysis of prestressed wound components with metal liners featuring arch-shaped sections. Our investigation revealed a noteworthy phenomenon termed the “additional bending moment effect” within prestressed wound components with arch-shaped sections. Furthermore, this study establishes a relationship between this additional bending moment and the external pressure. In addition, a 3D finite element (FE) model for prestressed wound components with arch-shaped sections incorporating metal liners was developed. The model’s accuracy was validated through a comparison with prestressed wound experiments, showcasing an error margin of less than 2%. In comparison with prestressed wound components with circular cross-sections under identical load and dimensional parameters, it was observed that prestressed wound components with arch-shaped sections exhibit stress distributions in the arc segments akin to their circular counterparts, with differences not exceeding 5%. Notably, when the ratio of the straight segment length to the inner diameter of the arc segment inner is less than 4, the deformation on the symmetric plane of the arc segment in an arch-shaped component can be effectively considered as the summation of deformations in equivalent-sized arc and straight segments under identical loading conditions. This yields an equivalent physical model and a streamlined analysis and design methodology for describing the deformation characteristics of prestressed wound components with arch-shaped sections.},

ABSTRACT = {The convolution of two physical entities, denoted as f and g, delineates the manner in which one entity undergoes modification in response to the other. This transformative process is mathematically represented by the expression f ⨂ g, symbolizing the convolution of the two entities in a resultant function h. Frequently, it becomes imperative to comprehend the magnitude of the induced modifications. From the derived function h, a crucial step involves the separation of the two original signals, a process commonly referred to as deconvolution. Various techniques have been proposed to facilitate the calculation of the deconvolution, with one notable approach originating in 1931 by van Cittert. The algorithm, based on an iterative method, has been scrutinized over time, notably by Bracewell and, more recently, by Jansson. This work represents the current state-of-the-art, focusing specifically on the analysis of Auger spectra obtained through XPS. Emphasis is placed on delineating the procedural aspects of the analysis, and the algorithm utilized in the open-source software RxpsG is comprehensively described.},

ABSTRACT = {Neutrons interact with the magnetic moment of the atomic shell of an atom, as is common for X-rays, but mainly they interact directly with the nucleus. Therefore, the atomic number and the related number of electrons does not play a role in the strength of an interaction. Instead, hydrogen that is nearly invisible for X-rays has a higher attenuation for neutrons than most of the metals, e.g., zirconium, and thus would be visible through dark contrast in neutron images. Consequently, neutron imaging is a precise, non-destructive method to quantify the amount of hydrogen in materials with low attenuation. Because nuclear fuel cladding tubes of light water reactors are made of zirconium (98%), the hydrogen amount and distribution in metallic claddings can be investigated. Even hydrogen concentrations smaller than 10 wt.ppm can be determined locally with a spatial resolution of less than 10 μm (with a high-resolution neutron microscope). All in all, neutron imaging is a very fast and precise method for several applications. This article explains the basics of neutron imaging and provides samples of investigation possibilities, e.g., for hydrogen in zirconium alloy cladding tubes or in situ investigations of hydrogen diffusion in metals.},

Cold-crucible induction using the levitation synthesis technique, conducted under an argon-controlled atmosphere, was employed to fabricate the TNZTSF alloy. After synthesis, the alloy underwent cold deformation by rolling, reaching a total deformation degree (total applied thickness reduction) of 60%. Subsequently, a solution treatment was conducted at 850 °C, with varying treatment durations ranging from 2 to 30 min in 2 min increments. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) techniques were utilized for the structural analysis, while the mechanical properties were assessed using both tensile and hardness testing. The findings indicate that (i) in both the cold-deformed-by-rolling and solution-treated states, the TNZTSF alloy exhibits a microstructure consisting of a single β-Ti phase; (ii) in the solution-treated state, the microstructure reveals a rise in the average grain size and a decline in the internal average microstrain as the duration of the solution treatment increases; and (iii) owing to the β-phase stability, a favorable mix of elevated strength and considerable ductility properties can be achieved.},

ABSTRACT = {This study aims to investigate in situ the three-dimensional (3D) morphology and distribution of primary carbides (PCs) in electro-slag remelting (ESR) forged 30Cr3Ni3Mo2V steel. A facile non-aqueous electrolytic etching method was applied to prepare 3D PCs on the matrix. The morphology, composition, and element concentrations of PCs were characterized using a combination of optical microscopy (OM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), and electron back-scattered diffusion (EBSD). The precipitation, type, and composition of PCs in the same steel were also simulated using Thermo-Calc software Version 2015a. The results indicate that PC is rich in Nb, which is a potential heterogeneous nucleating agent. Both the size and number of PCs increase from the edge to the center of the ingot. The large-sized PCs present three dominant types of morphology, which vary in different regions, i.e., a bulky type dominates in the edge region, a lamellar type dominates in the middle region, and a stripy type dominates in the core region. The results of EBSD analysis show that the orientation of PCs with different morphologies is different and that more nanosized V-rich type carbides are precipitated on the matrix. The thermodynamic calculations show that MC precipitates from the liquid phase when the solid phase fraction is greater than 0.985 and that the MC-type carbides are rich in Nb, which agrees well with the experimental results.},

ABSTRACT = {This study aims to establish a correlation between the fragmentation process and the growth mechanisms of a coating deposited on a fluoropolymer. Deposition was carried out using dielectric barrier discharge at atmospheric pressure, employing an oxygen-containing organic precursor in a nitrogen environment. The findings reveal that the impact of precursor concentration on the formation of specific functionalities is more significant than the influence of treatment time. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results obtained indicate a reduction in the N/O ratio on the coating’s surface as the precursor concentration in the discharge increases. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis, conducted in the spectral range of 1500 cm−1 to 1800 cm−1, confirmed the connection between the chemical properties of plasma-deposited thin films and the concentration of organic precursors in the discharge. Furthermore, the emergence of nitrile moieties (C≡N) in the FTIR spectrum at 2160 cm−1 was noted under specific experimental conditions.},

ABSTRACT = {Graphite IG-110 is a synthetic polycrystalline material used as a neutron moderator in reactors. Graphite is inherently brittle and is known to exhibit a further increase in brittleness due to radiation damage at room temperature. To understand the irradiation effects on pre-existing defects and their overall influence on external load, micropillar compression tests were performed using in situ nanoindentation in the Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) for both pristine and ion-irradiated samples. While pristine specimens showed brittle and subsequent catastrophic failure, the 2.8 MeV Au2+ ion (fluence of 4.378 × 1014 cm−2) irradiated specimens sustained extensive plasticity at room temperature without failure. In situ TEM characterization showed nucleation of nanoscale kink band structures at numerous sites, where the localized plasticity appeared to close the defects and cracks while allowing large average strain. We propose that compressive mechanical stress due to dimensional change during ion irradiation transforms buckled basal layers in graphite into kink bands. The externally applied load during the micropillar tests proliferates the nucleation and motion of kink bands to accommodate the large plastic strain. The inherent non-uniformity of graphite microstructure promotes such strain localization, making kink bands the predominant mechanism behind unprecedented toughness in an otherwise brittle material.},

ABSTRACT = {The interactions between plasma and liquids cause complex physical and chemical reactions at the gas–liquid contact surface, producing numerous chemically active particles that can rapidly reduce noble metal ions. This study uses atmospheric-pressure surface dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma to treat ethanol aqueous solutions containing noble metal precursors, and stable gold, platinum, and palladium colloids are obtained within a few minutes. To evaluate the mechanism of the reduction of noble metal precursors by atmospheric-pressure surface DBD plasma, the corresponding metal colloids are prepared first by activating an ethanol aqueous solution with plasma and then adding noble metal precursors. It is found that the long-lived active species hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) plays a dominant role in the synthesis process, which has distinct effects on different metal ions. When HAuCl4 and H2PdCl4 are used as precursors, H2O2 acts as a reducing agent, and AuCl4− and PdCl42− ions can be reduced to metallic Au and Pd. However, when AgNO3 is the precursor, H2O2 acts as an oxidising agent, and Ag+ ions cannot be reduced to obtain metal colloids because metallic Ag can be dissolved in H2O2 under acidic conditions. A similar phenomenon was also observed for the preparation of Pd colloid-PA with a plasma-activated ethanol aqueous solution using Pd(NO3)2 as a Pd precursor.},

ABSTRACT = {The effect of structure on the vibration response was explored for four piano soundboards with different but commonly adopted structures. The vibration response was obtained using the free-vibration method, and the values of the dynamic modulus of elasticity and dynamic shear modulus obtained using the free-vibration frequency method (EF and GF) were compared with the dynamic modulus of elasticity obtained using the Euler beam method (EE) and dynamic shear modulus obtained using the free-plate torsional vibration method (GT), respectively. It was found that the soundboards with different structures had different vibration modes and that excitation at different locations highlighted different vibration modes. For all the soundboards analyzed, the EE and GT were higher than EF and GF by 2.2% and 24.3%, respectively. However, the trends of the results of these methods were the same. The four piano soundboards with different structures possessed varying dynamic moduli of elasticity and dynamic shear moduli. These rules are consistent with the grain directions of the soundboards and the anisotropy of the wood (the direction of the units of the soundboards). The results show that the vibration mode of the piano soundboard is complex. The dynamic elastic modulus of the soundboard can be calculated using the Euler beam method. The results provide a reference for studies on the vibration response, material selection, production technology, and testing of piano soundboards.},

ABSTRACT = {This research delves into the characterization of the ultrasonic transmission coefficient pertaining to various types of bonding defects in Fiber-Reinforced Polymer (FRP)-bonded structures. Initially, an ultrasonic transmission coefficient calculation model for FRP-bonded structures in a water immersion environment is established. This model is used to analyze the variation in the ultrasonic transmission coefficient under different defect types, namely intact bonding, interfacial slip, and debonding defects. Subsequently, a frequency domain finite element analysis model of FRP-bonded structures with different defect types is constructed. The simulation validates the accuracy of the theoretical analysis results and concurrently analyzes the variation in the transmission signal when the defects alter. Lastly, an experimental platform for water immersion ultrasonic transmission measurement is set up. The transmission signals under different defect types are extracted through experiments and evaluated in conjunction with theoretical calculations to assess the types of bonding defects.},

ABSTRACT = {Fiber-Reinforced Polymer (FRP) composites have emerged as a promising alternative to conventional steel reinforcements in concrete structures owing to their benefits of corrosion resistance, higher strength-to-weight ratio, reduced maintenance cost, extended service life, and superior durability. However, there has been limited research on non-destructive testing (NDT) methods applicable for identifying damage in FRP-reinforced concrete (FRP-RC) elements. This knowledge gap has often limited its application in the construction industry. Engineers and owners often lack confidence in utilizing this relatively new construction material due to the challenge of assessing its condition. Thus, the main objective of this study is to determine the applicability of two of the most common NDT methods: the Ground-Penetrating Radar (GPR) and Phased Array Ultrasonic (PAU) methods for the detection of damage in FRP-RC elements. Three slab specimens with variations in FRP type (glass-, carbon- and basalt-FRP, i.e., GFRP, CFRP, and BFRP, respectively), bar diameter, bar depths, and defect types were investigated to determine the limitations and detection capabilities of these two NDT methods. The results show that GPR could detect damage in GFRP bars and CFRP strands, but PAU was limited to damage detection in CFRP strands. The findings of this study show the applicability of conventional NDT methods to FRP-RC and at the same time identify the areas with a need for further research.},

This idea came from the necessity of a study that can improve common camouflage techniques to yield a product that is cheap, light, and easy to manufacture and assemble. The author investigated the possibility of exploiting a rotation to achieve transparency and color changing. One of the most important examples of a kirigami structure is a geometry based on rotating squares, which is a one-degree-of-freedom mechanism. In this study, light polarization and birefringence were exploited to obtain transparency and color-changing properties using two polarizers and common cellophane tape. These elements were assembled with a rotating-square structure that allowed the rotation of a polarizer placed on the structure with respect to a fixed polarizer equipped with cellophane layers.},

ABSTRACT = {Thermogravimetry coupled with thermal analysis and quadrupole mass spectroscopy TGA/DTA-QMS were primarily used to assess the oxidation susceptibility of a pool of nanocrystalline powders of the semiconductor kesterite Cu2ZnSnS4 for prospective photovoltaic applications, which were prepared via the mechanochemically assisted synthesis route from two different precursor systems. Each system, as confirmed by XRD patterns, yielded first the cubic polytype of kesterite with defunct semiconductor properties, which, after thermal annealing at 500 °C under neutral gas atmosphere, was converted to the tetragonal semiconductor polytype. The TGA/DTA-QMS determinations up to 1000 °C were carried out under a neutral argon Ar atmosphere and under a dry, oxygen-containing gas mixture of O2:Ar = 1:4 (vol.). The mass spectroscopy data confirmed that under each of the gas atmospheres, a distinctly different, multistep evolution of such oxygen-bearing gaseous compounds as sulfur oxides SO2/SO3, carbon dioxide CO2, and water vapor H2O was taking place. The TGA/DTA changes in correlation with the nature of evolving gases helped in the elucidation of the plausible chemistry linked to kesterite oxidation, both in the stage of nanopowder synthesis/storage at ambient air conditions and during forced oxidation up to 1000 °C in the dry, oxygen-containing gas mixture.},

ABSTRACT = {This study examined the thermal dehydration characteristics of CaSO4∙2H2O in a constant-volume rotary vessel. The experiment used CaSO4∙2H2O particles obtained from the crushed waste gypsum board. The particle size ranged from 850 to 2000 μm, and the experiment was carried out at varying rotation speeds of 1, 10, and 35 rpm, with the vessel temperature heated to 180 °C. Temperature and pressure inside the vessel were measured simultaneously using the thermocouple and the pressure sensor. The XRPD measurement analyzed the transition of CaSO4∙2H2O after the heating of particles. The result showed that the temperature growth rate was similar for high rotation speeds of 10 and 35 rpm, while periodic temperature changes occurred at the low rotation speed of 1 rpm. A distinguishing flow pattern was observed at the low rotation speed, and the particles inside the vessel collapsed periodically downward. This particle behavior was related to the temperature distribution of the rotation speed of 1 rpm. Additionally, the pressure in the vessel increased rapidly at higher rotation speeds. This trend indicates the desorption of the crystal water of CaSO4∙2H2O due to the increasing temperature in the case of high rotation speed. Also, the XRPD measurement results showed the appearance of CaSO4∙0.5H2O under the higher rotation speed conditions, and the mass fraction of CaSO4∙0.5H2O increased with the rotation speed. Overall, the present study suggests that rotation speed plays a crucial role in determining the heat conduction and heat transfer of particles in a constant-volume rotary vessel.},

ABSTRACT = {Titanium alloys have high specific strength and corrosion resistance, which have promising applications in industry. However, the machinability of titanium alloys is limited due to their crystal lattice and physical properties. Thus, in recent years, the superplastic forming of titanium alloys has been intensively developing, in particular, forming at low temperatures and/or high strain rates. In this work, a tensile test of low-cost Ti-2Fe-0.1B alloys was carried out at a temperature of 550~750 °C and a strain rate of 1 × 10−3 s−1~1 × 10−2 s−1. The results showed that the alloy exhibited good superplasticity even at a high strain rate (1 × 10−2 s−1) and a low deformation temperature of 550 °C; the elongation of the alloy in this state reached 137.5%. The high strain rate sensitivity coefficient m (0.3) and the maximum elongation (452%) were obtained at a strain rate of 1 × 10−3 s−1 and a temperature of 750 °C. Characteristics of the microstructure showed that during superplastic deformation, the recrystallization and grain boundary sliding of the alloy phases were accelerated, which could be ascribed to the effect of the element Fe. At the same time, the TiB phase located around the primary elongated α grains could also induce dynamic recrystallization and dynamic globularization during deformation.},

ABSTRACT = {Diffusion bonding technology is widely used in the connection of precision components, yet accurately and reliably detecting contact-type defects on the bond interface still remains a significant problem. Nonlinear ultrasonic methods have been proven to be sensitive to contact-type defects; however, the use of continuous wave or tone burst wave excitation limits its wider application. In this paper, dual-probe nonlinear ultrasonic testing with pulse wave excitation is proposed to detect contact-type defects in diffusion-bonded joints. A titanium alloy diffusion-bonded specimen with artificial defects was fabricated, and the corresponding detection device was designed based on the existing ultrasonic C-scan testing system. A C-scan imaging program based on nonlinear parameters was developed by extracting the fundamental and second harmonic waves of the reflection echo on the bond interface. The results demonstrated that the proposed detection scheme can obtain the nonlinear parameters of diffusion-bonded interfaces, and the nonlinear ultrasonic C-scan image of the bond interface is also obtained. The nonlinear parameter in the contact-type defects areas calculated from the bond interface echo is about 10 times (20 dB) higher than that in macro defects areas, whose gap is about 10 μm. The results indicate that the nonlinear ultrasonic methods seem to be more sensitive to contact-type defects and have a great potential to complement the insufficient detection capability of linear ultrasound for diffusion-bonded joints.},

ABSTRACT = {Thermally induced pores (TIPs) are generally the source of fatigue crack initiation in the powder metallurgy (PM) Ni-based FGH96 superalloy. The effect of TIPs on fatigue crack initiation on the surface of the FGH96 superalloy was detected using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The cause of fatigue crack deflection was studied using electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) analysis. The results indicated that there are two states of TIPs including isolated TIPs and clustered TIPs located at the grain boundary. The investigation of crack initiation and propagation around TIPs was conducted in detail through the comprehensive integration of experimental findings and computational results. For cracks initiated by isolated TIPs, the maximum equivalent size and the ratio of the vertical–parallel axis to the loading direction of the TIPs reveal a linear relationship, and both of them determine crack initiation. Regarding clustered TIPs, the constituent pores of the clustered TIPs will compete to initiate cracks based on the experimental results, and the largest pore will be more likely to initiate cracking. Moreover, the results showed that fatigue crack propagation can be hindered by hard-orientation grains and twins with a low Schmid factor (SF). Large-angle crack deflection due to twins with a low SF can significantly increase crack length and resistance to crack propagation.},

ABSTRACT = {This study investigates how deviation angles close to the [001] orientation affect the tensile properties and deformation behavior of a nickel-based single-crystal superalloy at room temperature. The research focuses on samples with deviation angles of 3°, 8°, and 13° from the [001] orientation and examines their strength and ductility. We employed scanning electron microscopy (SEM), electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to explore the deformation micro-mechanisms at varying angles. Findings reveal that strength decreases and ductility increases as the deviation angle widens within the [001] vicinity. The study emphasizes that <110> octahedral slip-driven crystal slip and rotation are crucial for understanding tensile deformation. The deformation differences in samples at varying angles are attributed to the differential engagement of mechanisms. Specifically, at lower angles, reduced ductility and increased strength are due to short lattice rotation paths and work hardening causing superlattice stacking faults (SSFs) to slip in two directions on the {111} plane within the γ′ phase. As the angles increase, the lattice rotation paths extend, and Shockley partial dislocations (a/6<112>) accumulate in γ channels. This process, involving SSFs moving in a single direction within the γ′ phase, results in higher ductility and reduced strength.},

ABSTRACT = {The purpose of this study is to use acoustic emission (AE) technology to explore the changes in the interface and mechanical properties of GF/VER composite materials after being treated with NaOH and to analyze the optimal modification conditions and damage propagation process. The results showed that the GF surface became rougher, and the number of reactive groups increased after treating the GF with a NaOH solution. This treatment enhanced the interfacial adhesion between the GF and VER, which increased the interfacial shear strength by 25.31% for monofilament draw specimens and 27.48% for fiber bundle draw specimens compared to those before the GF was modified. When the modification conditions were a NaOH solution concentration of 2 mol/L and a treatment time of 48 h, the flexural strength of the GF/VER composites reached a peak value of 346.72 MPa, which was enhanced by 20.96% compared with before the GF was modified. The process of damage fracture can be classified into six types: matrix cracking, interface debonding, fiber pullout, fiber relaxation, matrix delamination, and fiber breakage, and the frequency ranges of these failure mechanisms are 0~100 kHz, 100~250 kHz, 250~380 kHz, 380~450 kHz, 450~600 kHz, and 600 kHz and above, respectively. This paper elucidates the fracture process of GF/VER composites in three-point bending. It establishes the relationship between the AE signal and the interfacial and force properties of GF/VER composites, realizing the classification of the damage process and characterizing the mechanism. The frequency ranges of damage types and failure mechanisms found in this study offer important guidance for the design and improvement of composite materials. These results are of great significance for enhancing the interfacial properties of composites, assessing the damage and fracture behaviors, and implementing health monitoring.},

ABSTRACT = {In addressing the global need for sustainable energy conversion, this study presents a breakthrough in thermoelectric materials research by optimizing the Bi2O2Se1–xTex system in the Bi2O2Se/Bi2O2Te pseudobinary series. Leveraging the principles of innovative transport mechanisms and defect engineering, we introduce tellurium (Te) doping into Bi2O2Se to enhance its thermoelectric properties synergistically. With the help of various advanced characterization tools such as XRD, SEM, TEM, XPS, FTIR, TGA, LFA, and DSC, combined with relevant resistance and density measurement techniques, we conducted an in-depth exploration of the complex interactions between various factors within thermoelectric materials. We recognize that the balance and synergy of these factors in the thermoelectric conversion process are crucial to achieving efficient energy conversion. Through systematic research, we are committed to revealing the mechanisms of these interactions and providing a solid scientific foundation for the optimal design and performance enhancement of thermoelectric materials. Finally, the advantage coefficient (ZT) of the thermoelectric material has been significantly improved. The crystallographic analysis confirms the formation of a continuous series of mixed crystals with varying Te concentrations, adhering to Vegard’s law and exhibiting significant improvements in electrical and thermal conductivities. The Bi2O2Se1–xTex crystals, particularly the Bi2O2Se0.6Te0.4 composition, demonstrate a peak ZT of 0.86 at 373 K. This achievement aligns with recent advancements in defect-enabled mechanisms and band convergence and sets a new standard for high-performance thermoelectrics. The study’s findings contribute significantly to the ongoing quest for efficient thermal-to-electrical energy conversion, offering a promising avenue for future sustainable energy technologies.},

ABSTRACT = {The generation of mechanical characteristics in workpiece subsurface layers as a result of the cutting process has a predominant influence on the performance properties of machined parts. The effect of the end milling process on the mechanical characteristics of the machined subsurface layers was evaluated using nondestructive methods: instrumented nanoindentation and sclerometry (scratching). In this paper, the influence of one of the common processes of materials processing by cutting—the process of end tool milling—on the generation of mechanical characteristics of workpiece machined subsurface layers is studied. The effect of the end milling process on the character of mechanical property formation was evaluated through the coincidence of the cutting process energy characteristics with the mechanical characteristics of the machined subsurface layers. The total cutting power and cutting work in the tertiary cutting zone area were used as energy characteristics of the end milling process. The modes of the end milling process are considered as the main parameters affecting these energy characteristics. The mechanical characteristics of the workpiece machined subsurface layers were the microhardness of the subsurface layers and the total work of indenter penetration, determined by instrumental nanoindentation, and the maximum depth of indenter penetration, determined by sclerometry. Titanium alloy Ti10V2Fe3Al (Ti-1023) was used as the machining material. Based on the evaluation of the coincidence of the cutting process energy characteristics with the specified mechanical characteristics of the machined subsurface layers, the milling mode effect of the studied titanium alloy, in particular the cutter feed and cutting speed, on the generated mechanical characteristics was established.},

ABSTRACT = {In recent years, antimony sulfide (Sb2S3) has been investigated as a photovoltaic absorber material due to its suitable absorber coefficient, direct band gap, extinction coefficient, earth-abundant, and environmentally friendly constituents. Therefore, this work proposes Sb2S3 film preparation by an effective two-step process using a new graphite box design and sulfur distribution, which has a high repeatability level and can be scalable. First, an Sb thin film was deposited using the RF-Sputtering technique, and after that, the samples were annealed with elemental sulfur into a graphite box, varying the sulfurization time from 20 to 50 min. The structural, optical, morphological, and chemical characteristics of the resulting thin films were analyzed. Results reveal the method’s effectivity and the best properties were obtained for the sample sulfurized during 40 min. This Sb2S3 thin film presents an orthorhombic crystalline structure, elongated grains, a band gap of 1.69 eV, a crystallite size of 15.25 Å, and a nearly stoichiometric composition. In addition, the formation of a p-n junction was achieved by depositing silver back contact on the Glass/FTO/CdS/Sb2S3 structure. Therefore, the graphite box design has been demonstrated to be functional to obtain Sb2S3 by a two-step process.},

ABSTRACT = {Multifunctional nanocomposites from an equimolar As4S4/Fe3O4 cut section have been successfully fabricated from coarse-grained bulky counterparts, employing two-step mechanochemical processing in a high-energy mill operational in dry- and wet-milling modes (in an aqueous solution of Poloxamer 407 acting as a surfactant). As was inferred from the X-ray diffraction analysis, these surfactant-free and surfactant-capped nanocomposites are β-As4S4-bearing nanocrystalline–amorphous substances supplemented by an iso-compositional amorphous phase (a-AsS), both principal constituents (monoclinic β-As4S4 and cubic Fe3O4) being core–shell structured and enriched after wet milling by contamination products (such as nanocrystalline–amorphous zirconia), suppressing their nanocrystalline behavior. The fluorescence and magnetic properties of these nanocomposites are intricate, being tuned by the sizes of the nanoparticles and their interfaces, dependent on storage after nanocomposite fabrication. A specific core–shell arrangement consisted of inner and outer shell interfaces around quantum-confined nm-sized β-As4S4 crystallites hosting a-AsS, and the capping agent is responsible for the blue-cyan fluorescence in as-fabricated Poloxamer capped nanocomposites peaking at ~417 nm and ~442 nm, while fluorescence quenching in one-year-aged nanocomposites is explained in terms of their destroyed core–shell architectures. The magnetic co-functionalization of these nanocomposites is defined by size-extended heterogeneous shells around homogeneous nanocrystalline Fe3O4 cores, composed by an admixture of amorphous phase (a-AsS), nanocrystalline–amorphous zirconia as products of contamination in the wet-milling mode, and surfactant.},

ABSTRACT = {The presence of alkaline earth cations, in particular, Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions in brine, causes undesired effects in solutions containing anionic surfactants because of precipitate formation. In the present study, an anionic surfactant, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), was investigated, focusing on the determination of various properties (surface tension, critical micelle concentration, micelle size, turbidity) in the presence of alcohols and, in particular, the inhibition of the precipitation of SDS with calcium ions. The calcium ions were added to the surfactant in increasing concentrations (3.0–10.0 g/L), and short-carbon-chain alcohols (methanol, ethanol, n-propanol and n-butanol) were used to shift the onset of precipitate formation. The critical micelle concentration (CMC) of SDS in the presence of alcohols was also determined. It was established that among these alcohols, methanol and ethanol did not exert significant effects on the solubility of the Ca(DS)2 precipitate, while n-propanol and n-butanol were found to be much more efficient inhibitors. In addition, all the alcohols in the applied concentration range (up to 20 V/V%) were found to decrease the critical micelle concentration of SDS.},

ABSTRACT = {There are some important advantages presented by metal specimens coated with WIP-C1 (Ni/CrC)-type materials. However, given the coating methods and the stress under dynamic loads, there are issues that need to be taken into account, particularly in terms of the behavior at the interface between the two materials. Using standardized cylindrical 1018 steel specimens uniformly coated with WIP-C1 (Ni/CrC) by cold spraying, this study investigated the fatigue behavior of the specimen as a whole, focusing on the interface areas of the two materials. The fatigue life diagram is given, to a large extent, by the behavior of the base material. As a result, in this work, we have focused not so much on the fatigue behavior of the assembly as on the integrity of the coating material and the defects, failures, etc., that may occur at the interface after a certain number of cycles. The applied load was cyclic fatigue through alternating–symmetric cycles. Scanning optical microscopy was used to observe plastic deformations and crack propagation during the breakage process. It was found that both the base material zone and the cover material zone presented good performance when the maximum stresses were at low values. A fatigue durability curve was also plotted, showing a conventional appearance for a metallic material, slightly influenced by the destruction of the base material interface. At higher maximum stress and, consequently, to large strains, a series of destructions at the interface of the two materials, of different types, were observed and will be highlighted in the paper.},

ABSTRACT = {Cu2Sn1-xGexS3 (CTGS) is a compound composed of relatively abundant elements in the crust of the earth. The band gap of CTGS can be tuned by substituting elements at the Sn and Ge sites, making it an attractive material for low-environmental-impact solar cells. In this study, CTGS thin films were fabricated with a controlled [Ge]/([Ge] + [Sn]) composition ratio (x) by combining the co-evaporation method and sulfurization in an infrared furnace. Furthermore, the effect of Na on the CTGS and changes in the solar cell properties were investigated by stacking and sulfurizing NaF on the precursor fabricated using the co-evaporation method. As a result, CTGS with varying x was successfully fabricated by varying the deposition time of the Cu2GeS3 layer using co-evaporation. Additionally, CTGS prepared by doping with Na showed enlarged CTGS crystals compared to Na-free CTGS. The fabricated CTGS solar cells achieved a power conversion efficiency of more than 4.5% after doping with Na.},

ABSTRACT = {The corrosion behavior of a hybrid laminate consisting of laser-structured aluminum EN AW-6082 ∪ carbon fiber-reinforced polymer was investigated. Specimens were corroded in aqueous NaCl electrolyte (0.1 mol/L) over a period of up to 31 days and characterized continuously by means of scanning electron and light microscopy, supplemented by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Comparative linear sweep voltammetry was employed on the first and seventh day of the corrosion experiment. The influence of different laser morphologies and production process parameters on corrosion behavior was compared. The corrosion reaction mainly arises from the aluminum component and shows distinct differences in long-term corrosion morphology between pure EN AW-6082 and the hybrid laminate. Compared to short-term investigations, a strong influence of galvanic corrosion on the interface is assumed. No distinct influences of different laser structuring and process parameters on the corrosion behavior were detected. Weight measurements suggest a continuous loss of mass attributed to the detachment of corrosion products.},

ABSTRACT = {In the present study, the stability and failure phenomena of thin-walled constructions subjected to axial compression, featuring a central cut-out, and constructed from composite materials were explored. These constructions were fabricated from a carbon–epoxy composite using the autoclave method. The research encompassed experimental assessments on actual specimens alongside numerical analyses employing the finite element approach within the ABAQUS® software. The investigation spanned the entire load spectrum up to the point of structural failure, incorporating both practical trials and simulation analysis. During the practical assessments, the study monitored the post-buckling response and captured acoustic emissions to thoroughly evaluate the composite’s failure mechanisms. Additionally, the ARAMIS system’s non-invasive three-dimensional scanning was employed to assess deformations. Theoretical simulations utilized a step-by-step failure analysis, initiating with failure onset as per Hashin’s theory and proceeding to failure progression based on an energy criterion. The simulation outcomes, particularly concerning the critical and post-critical phases, were juxtaposed with empirical data to identify the composite’s vulnerability zones. The comparison underscored a significant concordance between the simulation predictions and the empirical findings.},

ABSTRACT = {Carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) composites are popular materials in the aerospace and automotive industries because of their low weight, high strength, and corrosion resistance. However, wrinkles or geometric distortions in the composite layers significantly reduce their mechanical performance and structural integrity. This paper presents a method for non-destructively extracting the three-dimensional geometry, lamina by lamina, of a laminated composite. A method is introduced for fabricating consistent out-of-plane wrinkled CFRP laminate panels, simulating the in-service wrinkle observed in industries that utilize thick structure composites such as the vertical lift or wind power industries. The individual lamina geometries are extracted from the fabricated coupon with an embedded wrinkle from captured ultrasonic waveforms generated from single-element conventional ultrasonic (UT) scan data. From the extracted waveforms, a method is presented to characterize the wrinkle features within each individual lamina, specifically the spatially varying wrinkle height and intensity for the wrinkle. Parts were fabricated with visibly undetectable wrinkles using a wet layup process and a hot press for curing. Scans were performed in a conventional immersion tank scanning system, and the scan data were analyzed for wrinkle detection and characterization. Extraction of the layers was performed based on tracking the voltage peaks from A-scans in the time domain. Spatial Gaussian averaging was performed to smooth the A-scans, from which the surfaces were extracted for each individual lamina. The extracted winkle surface aligned with the anticipated wrinkle geometry, and a single parameter for quantification of the wrinkle intensity for each lamina is presented.},

ABSTRACT = {The synergistic effects of boron (B) and rare earth (RE) elements on the microstructure and stress rupture properties were investigated in a Ni-based superalloy. The stress rupture lifetime at 650 °C/873 MPa significantly increased with the addition of B as a single element. Furthermore, the stress rupture lifetime reached its peak (303 h), with a certain amount of B and RE added together in test alloys. Although the grain size and morphology of the γ′ phase varied a little with the change in B and RE addition, they were not considered to be the main reasons for stress rupture performance. The enhancement in stress rupture lifetime was mostly attributed to the segregation of the B and RE elements, which increased the binding force of the grain boundary and improved its strength and plasticity. In addition, the enrichment of B and RE inhabited the precipitation of carbides along grain boundaries. Furthermore, nano-scale RE precipitates containing sulfur (S) and phosphorus (P) were observed to be distributed along the grain boundaries. The purification of grain boundaries by B and RE elements was favorable to further improve the stress rupture properties.},

ABSTRACT = {Amorphous thin films can be applied to increase the anti-corrosion ability of critical components. Atomized FeCrNiMoCSiB powders were hot-pressed into a disc target for R. F. magnetron sputtering on a 316L substrate to upgrade its corrosion resistance. The XRD spectrum confirmed that the film deposited by R. F. magnetron sputtering was amorphous. The corrosion resistance of the amorphous film was evaluated in a 1 M HCl solution with potentiodynamic polarization tests, and the results were contrasted with those of a high-velocity oxy-fuel (HVOF) coating and 316L, IN 600, and C 276 alloys. The results indicated that the film hardness and elastic modulus, as measured using a nanoindenter, were 11.1 and 182 GPa, respectively. The principal stresses in two normal directions of the amorphous film were about 60 MPa and in tension. The corrosion resistance of the amorphous film was much greater than that of the other samples, which showed a broad passivation region, even in a 1 M HCl solution. Although the amorphous film showed high corrosion resistance, the original pinholes in the film were weak sites to initiate corrosion pits. After polarization tests, large, deep trenches were seen in the corroded 316L substrate; numerous fine patches in the IN 600 alloy and grain boundary corrosion in the C276 alloy were observed.},

ABSTRACT = {Lead-free K0.5Bi0.5TiO3 (KBT) ceramics with high density (~5.36 g/cm3, 90% of X-ray density) and compositional purity (up to 90%) were synthesized using a solid-state reaction method. Strongly condensed KBT ceramics revealed homogenous local microstructures. TG/DSC (Thermogravimetry-differential scanning calorimetry) techniques characterized the thermal and structural stability of KBT. High mass stability (>0.4%) has proven no KBT thermal decomposition or other phase precipitation up to 1000 °C except for the co-existing K2Ti6O13 impurity. A strong influence of crystallites size and sintering conditions on improved dielectric and non-linear optical properties was reported. A significant increase (more than twice) in dielectric permittivity (εR), substantial for potential applications, was found in the KBT-24h specimen with extensive milling time. Moreover, it was observed that the second harmonic generation (λSHG = 532 nm) was activated at remarkably low fundamental beam intensity. Finally, spectroscopic experiments (Fourier transform Raman and far-infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR)) were supported by DFT (Density functional theory) calculations with a 2 × 2 × 2 supercell (P42mc symmetry and C4v point group). Moreover, the energy band gap was calculated (Eg = 2.46 eV), and a strong hybridization of the O-2p and Ti-3d orbitals at Eg explained the nature of band-gap transition (Γ → Γ).},

ABSTRACT = {In this article, the practical issues connected with guided wave measurement are studied: (1) the influence of gluing of PZT plate actuators (NAC2013) on generated elastic wave propagation, (2) the repeatability of PZT transducers attachment, and (3) the assessment of the possibility of comparing the results of Laser Doppler Vibrometry (LDV) measurement performed on different 2D samples. The consideration of these questions is crucial in the context of the assessment of the possibility of the application of the guided wave phenomenon to structural health-monitoring systems, e.g., in civil engineering. In the examination, laboratory tests on the web of steel I-section specimens were conducted. The size and shape of the specimens were developed in such a way that they were similar to the elements typically used in civil engineering structures. It was proved that the highest amplitude of the generated wave was obtained when the exciters were glued using wax. The repeatability and durability of this connection type were the weakest. Due to this reason, it was not suitable for practical use outside the laboratory. The permanent glue application gave a stable connection between the exciter and the specimen, but the generated signal had the lowest amplitude. In the paper, the new procedure dedicated to objective analysis and comparison of the elastic waves propagating on the surface of different specimens was proposed. In this procedure, the genetic algorithms help with the determination of a new coordinate system, in which the assessment of the quality of wave propagation in different directions is possible.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper reports for the first time on a new layered magnetic heterometallic erbium telluride EuErCuTe3. Single crystals of the compound were obtained from the elements at 1120 K using CsI as a flux. The crystal structure of EuErCuTe3 was solved in the space group Cmcm (a = 4.3086(3) Å, b = 14.3093(9) Å, and c = 11.1957(7) Å) with the KZrCuS3 structure type. In the orthorhombic structure of erbium telluride, distorted octahedra ([ErTe6]9−) form two-dimensional layers (Er(Te1)2/2e(Te2)4/2k−)∞2, while distorted tetrahedra ([CuTe4]7−) form one-dimensionally connected substructures (Cu(Te1)2/2e(Te2)2/1t5−∞1) along the [100] direction. The distorted octahedra and tetrahedra form parallel two-dimensional layers (CuErTe32−∞2) between which Eu2+ ions are located in a trigonal-prismatic coordination environment (EuTe610−). The trigonal prisms are connected by faces, forming chains (Eu(Te1)2/2(Te2)4/22−∞1) along the [100] direction. Regularities in the variations in structural parameters were established in the series of erbium chalcogenides (EuErCuCh3 with Ch = S, Se, and Te) and tellurides (EuLnCuTe3 with Ln = Gd, Er, and Lu). Ab-initio calculations of the crystal structure, phonon spectrum, and elastic properties of the compound EuErCuTe3 were performed. The types and wavenumbers of fundamental modes were determined, and the involvement of ions in the IR and Raman modes was assessed. The experimental Raman spectra were interpreted. The telluride EuErCuTe3 at temperatures below 4.2 K was ferrimagnetic, as were the sulfide and selenide derivatives (EuErCuCh3 with Ch = S and Se). Its experimental magnetic characteristics were close to the calculated ones. The decrease in the magnetic phase transition temperature in the series of the erbium chalcogenides was discovered.},

ABSTRACT = {The reduction of friction-induced noise is a crucial research area for enhancing vehicle comfort, and this paper proposes a method based on circular pit texture to achieve this goal. We conducted a long-term sliding friction test using a pin-on-disc friction and a wear test bench to verify the validity of this method. To compare the friction noise of different surfaces, texture units with varying line densities were machined on the surface of friction disk samples. The resulting friction-wear and noise characteristics of the samples were analyzed in conjunction with the microscopic morphology of the worn surfaces. The results indicate that surfaces with textures can delay the onset of squeal noise, and the pattern of its development differs from that of smooth surfaces. The noise reduction effect is most evident due to the proper distribution of textures that can form furrow-like wear marks at the wear interface. The finite element results demonstrate that this morphology can improve pressure distribution at the leading point and reduce the tendency of system instability.},

ABSTRACT = {The existence of lead-zinc tailings threatens the social and ecological environment. The recycling of lead–zinc tailings is important for the all-round green transformation of economic society. In this study, the possibility of fabricating sintered ordinary bricks with lead–zinc tailings was studied based on orthogonal experimentation, and the phase composition and micromorphology of sintered products were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscope (SEM). With lead–zinc tailings as the main material, and clay and fly ash as additives, the effect of clay content, forming pressure, sintering temperature, and holding time on physical properties of sintered bricks was analyzed. The results show that clay content and sintering temperature have a major effect on compressive strength, while sintering temperature and holding time play an important role in water absorption. During sintering, mica, chlorite, and other components in lead–zinc tailings are decomposed to form albite, hematite, maghemite, and anhydrite, which play a role in the strength of bricks. The optimal process parameters were found to be a ratio of lead–zinc tailings:clay:fly ash = 6:3:1, forming pressure of 20 MPa, firing temperature of 1080 °C, and holding time of 60 min. The corresponding compressive strength and water absorption were 34.94 MPa and 16.02%, which meets the Chinese sintered ordinary bricks standard (GB/T 5101-2017).},

ABSTRACT = {Various methods exist for multiscale characterization of surface topographies, each offering unique insights and applications. The study focuses on fractal-based approaches, distinguishing themselves by leveraging fractals to analyze surface complexity. Specifically, the Richardson Patchwork method, used in the ASME B46.1 and ISO 25178 standards, is compared to the Sdr parameter derived from ISO 25178-2, with a low-pass Gaussian filter for multiscale characterization. The comparison is performed from the relative area calculated on topographies of TA6V samples grit blasted with different pressures and blasting materials (media). The surfaces obtained by grit blasting have fractal-like characteristics over the scales studied, enabling the analysis of area development at multiple levels based on pressure and media. The relative area is similar for both methods, regardless of the complexity of the topographies. The relevance scale for each calculation method that significantly represents the effect of grit blasting pressure on the increased value of the relative area is a tiling of 7657.64 µm² of triangle area for the Patchwork method and a 124.6 µm cut-off for the low-pass Gaussian filter of the Sdr method. These results could facilitate a standard, friendly, new fractal method for multiscale characterization of the relative area.},

ABSTRACT = {The use of CNC equipment that integrates several machining operations eliminates downtime due to changes in setup and clamping of workpieces in more than one machining device. A review of CNC equipment and tools known from the literature and from manufacturers’ offerings indicates that new technical solutions are being developed to integrate two or more technological operations. However, these examples have numerous limitations and are mostly not suitable for machining surfaces with complex shapes. An example of such solutions is the use of a dual-tool grinding head, which integrates the process of rough grinding with a ceramic grinding wheel and finish grinding with a flexible grinding wheel. Unfortunately, it has the disadvantage of being limited by the angular shape of the ceramic grinding wheel, making it unable to adapt to the complex geometries of the shaped surfaces being ground. The need to overcome this limitation became the motivation for the research work described in this article. By means of experimental research, it was verified what effect the radial outline on the periphery of a ceramic grinding wheel realized by rough grinding would have on the surface roughness parameters obtained in the process of grinding shaped surfaces. For this purpose, grinding processes using a ceramic wheel with a conical and radial outline were compared. The result of the study was a summary of the surface roughness parameters Sa, St, Sq, Spk, Str, and Sds obtained after two-stage machining (rough and finish grinding). The obtained analysis results showed that changing the axial outline of the ceramic grinding wheel makes it possible to significantly expand the range of applications of the dual-tool head without negatively affecting the quality of the machined surface. Thus, such an improvement will make it possible to increase the applicability of the head by grinding shaped surfaces with a radial profile of curvature.},

ABSTRACT = {A series of lead-free Rb2ZrCl6:xTe4+ (x = 0%, 0.1%, 0.5%, 1.0%, 2.0%, 3.0%, 5.0%, 10.0%) perovskite materials were synthesized through a hydrothermal method in this work. The substitution of Te4+ for Zr in Rb2ZrCl6 was investigated to examine the effect of Te4+ doping on the spectral properties of Rb2ZrCl6 and its potential applications. The incorporation of Te4+ induced yellow emission of triplet self-trapped emission (STE). Different luminescence wavelengths were regulated by Te4+ concentration and excitation wavelength, and under a low concentration of Te4+ doping (x ≤ 0.1%), different types of host STE emission and Te4+ triplet state emission could be achieved through various excitation energies. These luminescent properties made it suitable for applications in information encryption. When Te4+ was doped at high concentrations (x ≥ 1%), yellow triplet state emission of Te4+ predominated, resulting in intense yellow emission, which stemmed from strong exciton binding energy and intense electron-phonon coupling. In addition, a Rb2ZrCl6:2%Te4+@RTV scintillating film was fabricated and a spatial resolution of 3.7 lp/mm was achieved, demonstrating the potential applications of Rb2ZrCl6:xTe4+ in nondestructive detection and bioimaging.},
