ABSTRACT = {The production of tight gas wells decreases rapidly, and the traditional method is difficult to accurately predict the production of tight gas wells. At present, intelligent algorithms based on big data have been applied in oil and gas well production prediction, but there are still some technical problems. For example, the traditional error back propagation neural network (BP) still has the problem of finding the local optimal value, resulting in low prediction accuracy. In order to solve this problem, this paper establishes the output prediction method of BP neural network optimized with the sparrow search algorithm (SSA), and optimizes the hyperparameters of BP network such as activation function, training function, hidden layer, and node number based on examples, and constructs a high-precision SSA-BP neural network model. Data from 20 tight gas wells, the SSA-BP neural network model, Hongyuan model, and Arps model are predicted and compared. The results indicate that when the proportion of the predicted data is 20%, the SSA-BP model predicts an average absolute mean percentage error of 20.16%. When the proportion of forecast data is 10% of the total data, the SSA-BP algorithm has high accuracy and high stability. When the proportion of predicted data is 10%, the mean absolute average percentage error is 3.97%, which provides a new method for tight gas well productivity prediction.},

ABSTRACT = {This study focuses on the Bozhong 25-1 oilfield formation oil as the experimental subject, systematically investigating the influence of different slim tube lengths (1 m, 12.5 m, 20 m, and 25 m) on the minimum miscibility pressure (MMP) of the CO2 and formation oil mixture system. Through slim tube experiments, the interaction process of CO2 with formation oil in slim tubes of different lengths was simulated, with a particular focus on analyzing how changes in slim tube length affect the MMP. The experiments revealed an important phenomenon: as the slim tube length gradually increased from shorter dimensions, the MMP showed a decreasing trend; when the slim tube length reached 12.5 m, this trend stabilized, meaning that further increasing the slim tube length no longer led to significant changes in the MMP, with its stable value determined to be 27.86 MPa. This phenomenon can be explained within the theoretical framework of fluid dynamics and interfacial science, where several key factors play a significant role. Firstly, the flow characteristics of the fluid inside the slim tube significantly influence it; secondly, the interfacial tension between phases is also a decisive factor; lastly, the impact of the internal microstructure of the slim tube cannot be overlooked. These aspects together form the basis for understanding the impact of slim tube length on MMP and reveal the underlying mechanisms. This research is significant for deeply understanding and quantifying this effect, providing a solid theoretical basis for optimizing CO2 flooding technology and guiding more precise operational strategies in oilfield development practices to enhance oil displacement efficiency and economic benefits.},

ABSTRACT = {Despite renewable energy source integration being a well-established requirement in international policies, energy systems still face some unresolved issues, including the intermittence of production. To tackle this problem, a viable solution could comprise the off-peak storage of electricity production excess, to be consumed later during peak-load hours. The transition from the diffuse pattern of centralized generation to the distributed model, involving energy communities, suggests an additional aspect to manage: the spatial constraints of systems for domestic applications. Compressed-air energy storage represents a promising Power-to-Power technology for small-scale energy integration. This study proposes the application of a gas–liquid energy storage system (GLES) in a residential building, using renewable energy excess from a photovoltaic (PV) array. The performance of the proposed system, whose operation involves the compression of the gaseous mass through a piston operated by mineral oil, was evaluated through energy analysis performed simulating the devices and their coupling with the load profiles of the building. The thermodynamic model of storage was validated using data from an experimental campaign on a prototype. A sensitivity study, acting on the features of the system, such as the compression rate and vessel size, allowed us to compare the absorbed PV energy excess, the coverage of the building energy demand during the expansion phase, and the electrical efficiency of a daily cycle. The results obtained, together with the related economic analysis, were used to quantify the market potential of the proposed solution, to be exploited as a mechanical alternative to conventional electric batteries in dwellings.},

ABSTRACT = {Fracture–cavity carbonate reservoirs account for a considerable proportion of oil and gas resources. Because of the complicated relationships between cavities, fractures and pores in these reservoirs, which are defined as cavity clusters, fracturing technology is employed to enhance their hydrocarbon productivity. However, almost all previous studies have just considered the effect of a single natural cavity or fracture on the propagation of a hydraulic fracture; therefore, the mechanism by which a hydraulic fracture interacts with a cavity cluster needs to be clarified. In this study, cavity clusters with different distributions were accurately prefabricated in synthetically made samples, and large-scale simulation equipment was employed to systematically perform fracturing experiments considering different horizontal differential stress levels. Meanwhile, the hydraulic fracture propagation behaviors were comprehensively analyzed through fracture morphology, fracturing curves, the complexity of the fracture network and acoustic emission monitoring. It was found that a natural fracture with a smaller approach angle is favorable in guiding a hydraulic fracture to a cavity. The fracturing curves were divided into the following four types: frequent fluctuations with “step-like” shapes, great fluctuations with slightly lower closure pressure, fluctuations with obviously lower closure pressure, and little fluctuations with obviously lower closure pressure. And different cavity cluster distributions play a dominant role in the complexity of generated hydraulic fracture networks. In addition, AE energy was used to judge the ease of crossing the cavity. The above findings indicated that for the actual exploration and exploitation of carbonate reservoirs, the geological exploration of different fracture–cavity structures in reservoirs would be required, and targeted fracturing engineering designs need to be carried out for different fracture–cavity carbonate reservoirs.},

ABSTRACT = {Natural gas hydrate reservoirs, with shallow burial, poor cementation, and low strength, are prone to submarine landslides triggered by hydrate decomposition during extraction. Prior studies have inadequately considered factors such as the dynamic decomposition of hydrates during depressurization, and its impacts on the reservoir’s geomechanical properties. In this paper, a coupled thermal–hydraulic–mechanical–chemical mathematical model of hydrate decomposition is proposed, and the dynamic geomechanical response and the effect of hydrate decomposition on seafloor settlement and slope destabilization during the process of depressurization mining are analyzed by combining the strength discount method with the example of a hydrate-bearing seafloor slope in the Shenhu area. Furthermore, the study employs an orthogonal experimental design along with range and variance analysis to gauge the impact of critical factors (degree of hydrate decomposition, seawater depth, hydrate reservoir burial depth, hydrate reservoir thickness, and slope angle) on slope stability. The findings suggest that hydrate decomposition is non-uniform and is influenced by stratigraphic temperature gradients and gravity. In the region where hydrate decomposition occurs, the decrease of pore pressure leads to the increase of effective stress. Additionally, the decomposition of hydrates decreases the shear modulus of sediments, leading to deformation and reduced permeability in the affected area. Over a three-year period of depressurization mining, the significantly reduced safety factor increases the risk of landslides. Various factors play a role in the control of submarine slope stability, with slope inclination being the primary factor, followed by the degree of hydrate decomposition, reservoir thickness, burial depth, and seawater depth. Among these factors, hydrate burial depth and seawater depth have a positive correlation with submarine slope stability, while increases in other factors generally decrease stability. These research findings have important implications for the safe exploitation of slopes that contain hydrates.},

ABSTRACT = {Sustainable energy presently represents the energy of the future, which should be based on the application respecting the importance of energy priorities, increasing regional self-sufficiency, regional control of energy, and regulation of resource use. In the area of energy supply, the use of RES has been increasingly popular, mainly due to the instability in the energy market and the political situation worldwide. Paper’s ambition is to evaluate the efficiency of the selected RES use in the specific conditions of Slovakia, with the aim to achieve the EU targets. This is important due to the increasing use of RES in Slovakia. The objective of this paper is achieved through an analysis of the energy profit of the RES system, comparing the costs of the proposed solutions. The evaluation is carried out by calculating the energy and economic efficiency of three possible buildings used in the research. Using the data obtained, the results show the most suitable alternative for each building. The resulting findings provide a valuable insight for governments in identifying the best projects for RES use. The result will be methodology creation as a base for local administration and communities to elaborate plans with a goal to extend RES use.},

ABSTRACT = {With the increasing scale of photovoltaic (PV) power stations, timely anomaly detection through analyzing the PV output power curve is crucial. However, overlooking the impact of external factors on the expected power output would lead to inaccurate identification of PV station anomalies. This study focuses on the discrepancy between measured and expected PV power generation values, using a dual classification system. The system leverages two-dimensional Gramian angular field (GAF) data and curve features extracted from one-dimensional time series, along with attention weights from a CNN network. This approach effectively classifies anomalies, including normal operation, aging pollution, and arc faults, achieving an overall classification accuracy of 95.83%.},

ABSTRACT = {The hydrodynamic characteristic of the multiphase mixed-transport pipeline is essential to guarantee safe and sustainable oil–gas transport when extracting offshore oil and gas resources. The gas–liquid two-phase transport phenomena lead to unstable flow, which significantly impacts pipeline deformation and can cause damage to the pipeline system. The formation mechanism of the mixed-transport pipeline slug flow faces significant challenges. This paper studies the formation mechanism of two-phase slug flows in mixed-transport pipelines with multiple inlet structures. A VOF-based gas–liquid slug flow mechanical model with multiple inlets is set up. With the volumetric force source term modifying strategy, the formation mechanism and flow patterns of slug flows are obtained. The research results show that the presented strategy and optimization design method can effectively simulate the formation and evolution trends of gas–liquid slug flows. Due to the convective shock process in the eight branch pipes, a bias flow phenomenon exists in the initial state and causes flow patterns to be unsteady. The gas–liquid mixture becomes relatively uniform after the flow field stabilizes. The design of the bent pipe structure results in an unbalanced flow velocity distribution and turbulence viscosity on both sides, presenting a banded distribution characteristic. The bend structure can reduce the bias phenomenon and improve sustainable transport stability. These findings provide theoretical guidance for fluid dynamics research in offshore oil and gas and chemical processes, and also offer technical support for mixed-transport pipeline sustainability transport and optimization design of channel structures.},

ABSTRACT = {Accurately predicting the active power output of offshore wind power is of great significance for reducing the uncertainty in new power systems. By utilizing the spatiotemporal correlation characteristics among wind turbine unit outputs, this paper embeds the Diffusion Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) into the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) for the feature extraction of spatiotemporal correlations in wind turbine unit outputs. It also combines graph structure learning to propose a sequence-to-sequence model for ultra-short-term power prediction in large offshore wind farms. Firstly, the electrical connection graph within the wind farm is used to preliminarily determine the reference adjacency matrix for the wind turbine units within the farm, injecting prior knowledge of the adjacency matrix into the model. Secondly, a convolutional neural network is utilized to convolve the historical curves of units within the farm along the time dimension, outputting a unit connection probability vector. The Gumbel–softmax reparameterization method is then used to make the probability vector differentiable, thereby generating an optimal adjacency matrix for the prediction task based on the probability vector. At the same time, the difference between the two adjacency matrices is added as a regularization term to the loss function to reduce model overfitting. The simulation of actual cases shows that the proposed model has good predictive performance in ultra-short-term power prediction for large offshore wind farms.},

ABSTRACT = {In the context of emissions, carbon dioxide constitutes a predominant portion of greenhouse gases (GHGs), leading to the use of the term “carbon” interchangeably with these gases in climate-related discussions. The carbon market has emerged as a pivotal mechanism for emission regulation, allowing industries that struggle to meet emission reduction targets to acquire credits from those who have successfully curbed their emissions below stipulated levels. Thermoeconomics serves as a tool for analyzing multiproduct systems prevalent in diverse sectors, including sugarcane and alcohol mills, paper and pulp industries, steel mills, and cogeneration plants. These systems necessitate frameworks for equitable cost/emission allocation. This study is motivated by the need to expand the scope of thermoeconomic modeling to encompass expenses or revenues linked with the carbon market. By utilizing a cogeneration system as a representative case, this research aims to demonstrate how such modeling can facilitate the allocation of carbon market costs to final products. Moreover, it underscores the adaptability of this approach for internalizing other pertinent costs, encompassing expenses associated with environmental control devices, licenses, and permits. Although certain exergy disaggregation models depict an environmental component within diagrams, which is integral for addressing environmental burdens, even models without explicit environmental devices can effectively internalize carbon credits and allocate them to final products. The integration of carbon credits within thermoeconomic modeling introduces the capability to assess both the financial and environmental implications of emissions. This integration further incentivizes the reduction in GHGs and supports optimization endeavors concerning system design and operation. In summary, this study delves into the incorporation of carbon market dynamics into thermoeconomic modeling. It demonstrates the potential to allocate carbon-related costs, facilitates comprehensive cost analysis, encourages emission reduction, and provides a platform for enhancing system efficiency across industrial sectors.},

ABSTRACT = {Tight gas reservoirs possess unique pore structures and fluid flow mechanisms. Delving into the flow and imbibition mechanisms of water in fractured tight gas reservoirs is crucial for understanding and enhancing the development efficiency of such reservoirs. The flow of water in fractured tight gas reservoirs encompasses the flow within fractures and the imbibition flow within the matrix. However, conventional methods typically separate these two types of flow for study, failing to accurately reflect the true flow characteristics of water. In this study, micro-CT imaging techniques were utilized to evaluate the impact of matrix absorption and to examine water movement in fractured tight gas deposits. Water flooding experiments were conducted on tight sandstone cores with different fracture morphologies. Micro-CT scanning was performed on the cores after water injection and subsequent static conditions, simulating the process of water displacement gas in fractures and the displacement of gas in matrix pores by water through imbibition under reservoir conditions. Changes in gas–water distribution within fractures were observed, and the impact of fracture morphology on water displacement recovery was analyzed. Additionally, the recovery rates of fractures and matrix imbibition at different displacement stages were studied, along with the depth of water infiltration into the matrix along fracture walls. The insights gained from this investigation enhance our comprehension of the dynamics of fluid movement within tight gas deposits, laying a scientific foundation for crafting targeted development plans and boosting operational efficiency in such environments.},

ABSTRACT = {In order to improve the erosion resistance of steel PDC (Polycrystalline Diamond Compact) bit under high-speed fluid flow conditions underground, it is necessary to develop a high-performance erosion-resistant coating. In this paper, laser cladding was used to prepare the new coating by modifying tungsten carbide with graphene. And the effects of tungsten carbide content and graphene content on the coating performance have been thoroughly studied and analyzed to obtain the optimal covering layer. The research results indicate that, for new coatings, 60% tungsten carbide and 0.3% graphene are the optimal ratios. After adding tungsten carbide, the hardness has significantly improved. However, when the tungsten carbide content further increases more than 30%, the increase in hardness is limited. In addition, when the content of graphene is more than 0.3%, the branched structure becomes thicker. In detail, this is a phenomenon where the segregation of Cr, Si, and W becomes very obvious again, and the segregation of Fe occurs at the Ni enrichment site. The research results contribute to the development and optimization of high-quality erosion-resistant coatings under the high-speed flow conditions in wellbore. These are of great significance for improving the efficiency of oil and gas exploration and development.},

ABSTRACT = {The gas–water relative permeability curve plays a crucial role in reservoir simulation and development for condensate gas reservoirs. This paper conducted a series of high-temperature and high-pressure analysis experiments on real gas cores from Wells A and B in Block L of the Yinggehai Basin to investigate the effects of temperature, pressure, and different types of gas media on gas–water seepage. The gas–water relative permeability was simulated in this experiment through variations in temperature, pressure, and gas composition. Temperature has a significant impact on both gas and water relative permeability, particularly on gas relative permeability. As temperature increases, gas relative permeability shows a substantial increase, while water relative permeability remains relatively unchanged. Under the same effective stress, increasing pressure causes downward shifts in both the gas and water relative permeability curves; however, there is a more pronounced decrease in gas relative permeability. Gas composition has minimal influence on the gas–water relative permeability except at higher water saturation where differences become apparent. When water saturation ranges from 80% to 50%, there is no significant variation observed in the measured relative permeability of different displacement gases. However, as water saturation exceeds 80%, distinctions gradually emerge. The relative permeability of nitrogen is approximately 92% lower than that of mixed gas when the bound water saturation reaches 80%. This investigation provides valuable insights into the characteristics of gas–water relative permeability in high-temperature and high-pressure condensate reservoirs within Yinggehai Basin, thereby offering significant contributions to development strategies for similar reservoirs.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper presents a bi-level inverse robust economic dispatch optimization model consisting of wind turbines and pumped storage hydropower (PSH). The inner level model aims to minimize the total generation cost, while the outer level introduces the optimal inverse robust index (OIRI) for wind power output based on the ideal perturbation constraints of the objective function. The OIRI represents the maximum distance by which decision variables in the non-dominated frontier can be perturbed. Compared to traditional methods for quantifying the worst-case sensitivity region using polygons and ellipses, the OIRI can more accurately quantify parameter uncertainty. We integrate the grid multi-objective bacterial colony chemotaxis algorithm and the bisection method to solve the proposed model. The former is adopted to solve the inner level problem, while the latter is used to calculate the OIRI. The proposed approach establishes the relationship between the maximum forecast deviation and the minimum generation cost associated with each non-dominated solution in the optimal load allocation. To demonstrate its economic viability and effectiveness, we simulate the proposed approach using real power system operation data and conduct a comparative analysis.},

ABSTRACT = {In order to avoid potential personnel and financial losses, the evaluation of pre-drilling safety is of great importance in oil and gas exploration and development. This paper presents a method of evaluating pre-drilling safety through combining the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) with the Alternating Condition Expectation (ACE) method. An indicator system with a 9-3-1 structure was established, incorporating various unrestricted variables to describe the technical factor. Additionally, nine membership functions and weights were determined in order to build the AHP model by connecting the independent variables in the basic layer to dependent variables in the middle layer. Four transformed functions were also formulated to construct the ACE model by linking the middle variables to the pre-drilling safety value in the final layer. A total of 28 sets of on-site drilling data from three oilfields were collected for the establishment and verification of the AHP-ACE model. Average absolute error (AAE) and average absolute relative error (AARE) of the model to predict the training data are 0.03 and 4.29%, respectively, whereas the AAE and AARE for verification samples are 0.03 and 4.51%, respectively. The sensitivity ranking of the three potential variables is as follows: human factor exhibits the highest degree of sensitivity, followed by natural factor and technical factor, in descending order. The AHP-ACE model for pre-drilling safety assessment faces limitations in universal applicability and scope, particularly in real-time drilling activities. However, its potential for improvement lies in integrating insights from past operations and expanding the dataset to enhance accuracy and broaden safety assessment coverage. This method is not limited by blocks, which is of great significance to ensure drilling safety.},

ABSTRACT = {Vertical axis wind turbines (VAWTs) are gaining increasing significance in the realm of renewable energy. One notable advantage they possess is their ability to operate efficiently in diverse wind conditions, including low-speed and turbulent winds, which are often prevalent in urban areas. In this study, dimples and pitch angles into the rotor blades are used to enhance the aerodynamic performance of a straight-bladed Darrieus turbine. To simulate the turbine’s rotation under transient conditions, computational fluid dynamics calculations are conducted in a two-dimensional setting. The unsteady Navier–Stokes equations are solved, and the k-ω SST turbulence model is employed to represent turbulent flow. The results of the simulation demonstrate that the application of a circular dimple on the pressure side of the blades, positioned at 0.25 of the chord length with a diameter of 0.08 chord length, leads to a 5.18% increase in the power coefficient at λ = 2.7, in comparison to a turbine with plain airfoils. Moreover, when an airfoil with both a dimple and a + 1° pitch angle is utilized, the turbine’s performance at λ = 2.7 improved by 7.17% compared to a plain airfoil, and by 1.8% compared to a dimpled airfoil without a pitch angle. Additionally, the impact of a double dimple on both the pressure and suction sides of the airfoil on turbine performance was investigated. It was discovered that the double-dimpled airfoil exhibited lower performance in comparison to a plain airfoil. The study showed that the utilization of both dimples and pitch angles for airfoils of a Darrieus turbine blade increases the power generated by the turbine.},

Under weak dynamic conditions, the vertical migration and mass exchange of oil–water two-phase fluids in loose sandstone reservoirs occur very easily. The phenomenon of vertical seepage flow equilibrium has a significant impact on the distribution of oil–water two-phase fluids in the reservoir. However, existing mainstream numerical simulators cannot accurately describe the phenomenon of vertical migration of oil–water two-phase fluids under weak dynamic conditions. In this study, using 3D printing technology, multiple transparent rock core holders were constructed to conduct experiments on the vertical seepage flow equilibrium time of different viscosities and contents of crude oil under different permeabilities of rock cores. Through the analysis and regression of experimental results, a predictive formula for the vertical seepage flow equilibrium time of loose sandstone reservoirs was established. Based on the time-prediction discriminant formula, a multi-scale numerical simulation method for vertical seepage flow equilibrium was constructed. A comparison between the new method and experimental results showed that the numerical simulation method, considering vertical seepage flow equilibrium, is closer to experimental phenomena than traditional numerical simulation methods. This indicates that the method can more accurately reveal the characteristics and distribution laws of the vertical seepage flow of oil–water two-phase fluids in loose sandstone reservoirs.},

ABSTRACT = {Elevated temperatures at the transformer bushing cylinder head can precipitate failures, leading to significant power outages. In response, this study introduces a reversible temperature-indicating patch for the nuanced detection of thermal anomalies in the transformer bushing’s cylinder head. The patch, crafted through a melting process, utilizes a reversible discoloration material and is developed in two variants via an adsorption substrate method. Comprehensive evaluations of the patches’ color-changing characteristics, alongside their electrical and hydrophobic properties, were conducted using an automatic contact angle measuring instrument and an AC flashover test platform. The findings reveal that the temperature-indicating patch exhibits a discernible color transition within the range of 49~55 °C, with a color reversion temperature span of 45~55 °C, denoting marked sensitivity and robust reversibility. Additionally, it was observed that prolonged thermal aging correlates with a decrease in both the water contact angle and the discharge voltage per unit length across the surface of the patches, indicating a degradation in performance. Among the variants, the binder-based temperature-indicating patch demonstrated superior stability in electrical performance compared to its vacuum-based counterpart. The outcomes of this research offer valuable insights for the development of advanced diagnostic tools for the identification of thermal defects in transformer bushings, potentially enhancing reliability and safety in power distribution systems.},

ABSTRACT = {Industrial process heating furnace operations consume considerable energy in the U.S. manufacturing sector, making it crucial to identify energy efficient strategies due to the growing need to minimize energy usage and emissions. It is important to identify the potential impact of these factors to enable process engineers to operate process heating systems at the maximum possible efficiency. This study examines and identifies the key impact factors that influence the efficiency of process heating systems using MEASUR (v1.4.0), the DOE software tools such as the insulation effectiveness, the burner stoichiometry, cooling medium, thermal storage, and atmospheric gases. Data from a two-fuel-fired heat treatment furnace and an electric arc furnace (EAF) for steelmaking were employed to establish the baseline heat balance models in MEASUR. The fractional factorial design experiment was developed with two-level parameter values and energy efficiency strategies for the heat input into industrial furnaces. The three most significant parameters for the heat input for a fuel-fired industrial furnace, Industrial Furnace A, are excess air percentage or the oxygen percentage in flue gas (OF), average surface temperature (ST), and combustion air temperature (CT). Similarly, for an electric industrial furnace, Industrial Furnace B, the parameters are charge temperature (CHT), average surface temperature (ST), and time open (TO). A comparative analysis was carried out for the fuel-fired and equivalent electric resistance furnaces to identify the prospect of electrification of industrial furnaces relying upon fossil fuels. The study aims to assist industries and designers in making informed decisions regarding industrial furnace upgrades, process optimization, and maintenance investments, resulting in substantial energy and cost savings, and a reduced environmental impact.},

ABSTRACT = {Blowout is one of the most serious safety threats in deepwater drilling. Considering the characteristics of gas invasion in complex formations, gas migration and distribution, and dynamic changes in temperature inside a wellbore, a deepwater well-closing pressure determination method considering thermal-fluid-solid coupling was proposed. The model was verified using actual data, and the average error in the increase in casing pressure during the closing process was found to be 5.42%. The shut-in pressure of oil and gas wells under a transient shut-in process was analyzed. The results showed that the fluid thermal expansion caused by temperature recovery had a significant impact on the change in wellhead backpressure after well closure. Furthermore, the time required for the wellbore pressure to recover to the formation pressure varies nonlinearly with factors such as geothermal gradients, pit gains, bottom-hole pressure, and gas production indices. A pressure calculation chart was developed for deepwater drilling. The shut-in time for deepwater drilling should not be less than 15 min, and in cases where the gas production index is small and the bottomhole pressure difference is large, the shut-in time should exceed 90 min. The results can provide theoretical guidance and technical support for well shut-in processes during deepwater drilling.},

ABSTRACT = {New energy storage methods based on electrochemistry can not only participate in peak shaving of the power grid but also provide inertia and emergency power support. It is necessary to analyze the planning problem of energy storage from multiple application scenarios, such as peak shaving and emergency frequency regulation. This article proposes an energy storage capacity configuration planning method that considers both peak shaving and emergency frequency regulation scenarios. A frequency response model based on emergency frequency regulation combined with low-frequency load shedding is established, taking into account the frequency safety constraints of the system and the principle of idle time reuse, to establish a bi-level programming model. In the upper-level model, the optimization objective is to minimize the annual operating cost of the system during the planning period, combined with the constraints of power grid operation to plan the energy storage capacity. The lower-level model embeds frequency safety constraints with the optimization objective of minimizing the cost of fault losses. To solve the bi-level optimization problem, the Karush–Kuhn–Tucher (KKT) condition and Big-M method were used to transform the bi-level model into a single-layer linear model. Finally, an improved IEEE RTS-24 system was used for numerical verification. The results show that the method proposed in this article can reasonably plan the capacity of energy storage, improve frequency safety during system operation, and reduce the operating cost of the power grid.},

ABSTRACT = {With the notable achievements attained through the implementation of steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD), the vertical–horizontal steam drive (VHSD) emerges as a pivotal technological advancement aimed at significantly enhancing the efficiency of thin reservoir heavy oil recovery subsequent to steam cyclic stimulation. The inclusion of nitrogen assistance has proven effective in enhancing the efficacy of gravity drainage techniques in reservoir development. However, it is noteworthy that this method has only led to improvements in approximately 50% of the well groups within the observed field. The comprehensive evaluation index of VHSD was proposed, and as the objective function, it was determined that the greatest contribution to the VHSD technique lies in oil saturation, accounting for 40% of the overall evaluations. This differs from conventional SAGD operations, where reservoir thickness serves as the primary determinant. Building upon an enhanced physical simulation similarity criterion, two comparative injection scheme experiments were conducted to explore the impact of nitrogen injection on the performance of VHSD and the characteristics of the steam chamber. Nitrogen is distributed in the vicinity of the steam chamber, leading to the formation of a dual mechanism characterized by ‘top heat insulation and lateral traction’ on the steam chamber. The lateral traction accounts for approximately 25% of the team chamber volume. Additionally, the inducement of nitrogen causes a downward displacement of crude oil, resulting in its accumulation within the high-temperature region of the steam chamber. This, in turn, enhances the contact area between the high-temperature steam and the crude oil, ultimately leading to improvement in production efficiency. Further validation of the impact of nitrogen on steam lateral traction and interlayer steam drainage within the reservoir was confirmed using Xinjiang oilfield testing. The well temperature increased from 75 °C to 130 °C.},

ABSTRACT = {At present, assessment techniques for the fracability of shale reservoirs, which rely on the formation of an effective fracture network, are scarce. Hence, in order to assess the fracability, it is critical to establish a quantitative correlation between the pattern of fracture distribution after fracture and fracability. The present investigation utilizes three-dimensional digital core technology and triaxial compression experiments to simulate the fracturing process in typical domestic shale reservoir cores. In addition to utilizing the maximum ball algorithm to extract fracture images, a number of other techniques are employed to compute the spatial quantitative parameters of the fractures, including least squares fitting, image tracking algorithms, and three-dimensional image topology algorithms. The introduction of the notion of three-dimensional fracture complexity serves to delineate the degree of successful fracture network formation subsequent to fracturing. A quantitative fracability characterization model is developed by integrating the constraints of fracture network formation potential and fragmentation potential. The results of this study show that the quantitative characterization of the characteristic parameters of cracks can be achieved by establishing a method for extracting crack information as well as parameters after core compression and completing the construction of a three-dimensional complexity characterization model. Meanwhile, the three-dimensional post-compression fracture image validation shows that the core fracturability index can better reflect the actual fracturing situation, which is in line with the microseismic monitoring results, and significantly improves the accuracy of fracturability characterization, which is an important guideline for the fracturing design of shale gas reservoirs.},

ABSTRACT = {Fracture and stress environments significantly affect the flow of coalbed methane. Under stress, fracture deformation and damage occur, which change the original fracture characteristics and lead to changes in gas flow characteristics. The change in gas pressure gradient makes the fluid flow obviously nonlinear. Using linear flow theory to describe the fracture flow leads to a large error in predicting coalbed methane productivity. In this study, seepage tests on fractured coal are carried out under different stresses and gas pressure gradients, the nonlinear flow and changes in related parameters are analyzed, and the applicability of the nonlinear flow equation is evaluated. The resulting seepage of the gas flow in the fracture under stress is obviously nonlinear, which gradually increases with increasing effective stress and gas pressure gradient. When the Forchheimer equation is used to characterize the nonlinear seepage in fractures, the coefficients increase with increasing effective stress. The permeability, nonlinear factor, and critical Reynolds number decrease with increasing effective stress. When the Izbash equation is used for this case, the linear coefficient ranges from 1015 to 1016, and the nonlinear coefficient ranges from 1.064 to 1.795. The coefficients are related to the effective stress through a power function. Both the Forchheimer and Izbash equations can characterize the flow in rough fractures in coal during stress loading. However, the Forchheimer equation better reveals the mechanism of flow transformation from linear to nonlinear in fractures.},

ABSTRACT = {Desalination plants, which provide drinking water for residents, rely on electricity generated by fossil fuels. However, the excessive use of fossil fuels leads to their rapid depletion and has detrimental effects on the environment. Thus, the use of renewable energy resources in water desalination has gained popularity. The current research investigates the integration of renewable energy systems with seawater and brackish water desalination technologies. In this regard, three primary renewable energy sources—wind, solar, and geothermal—are selected. Accordingly, a thorough investigation of the related research published and the trend of evolutions between 2013 and 2023 is carried out for Reverse Osmosis (RO), Multistage flash (MSF), and Multi-effect distillation (MED)-based water desalination facilities coupled with renewable energy sources. In our investigation, we particularly focus on performance indicators, energy efficiency, economic factors, and environmental effects. Also, the associated challenges of these hybrid systems, such as technological complexity, unpredictability, and intermittency, are addressed. Prospects for the future that address these issues and the prospects of using renewable energy in water desalination technologies are also covered.},

We propose a novel integrated energy system planning strategy that can enhance the systems’ ability to respond to such events. Our strategy unfolds in two stages. Initially, we devise expansion strategies for the interdependent networks through a detailed tri-level planning model, including transmission, generation, and market dynamics within a deregulated electricity market setting, formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem. Subsequently, we assess the impact of extreme events through worst-case scenarios, applying previously determined network configurations. Finally, the integrated expansion planning strategies are evaluated using real-world test systems.},

ABSTRACT = {Coal seam pressure is an important parameter for production performance evaluation and prediction of coalbed methane (CBM). CBM production from undersaturated CBM reservoirs can be divided into two stages according to critical desorption pressure. At present, few prediction models of coal seam pressure performance consider the comprehensive influence of critical desorption pressure, dissolved gas, matrix shrinkage, and stress sensitivity. For the purpose of accurately predicting coal seam pressure during gas production for an undersaturated coalbed methane reservoir, the material balance principle is used to establish the analytical method for predicting coal seam pressure, considering the comprehensive influence of the critical desorption pressure, dissolved gas, matrix shrinkage, and stress sensitivity. Then, the proposed method is verified against a numerical simulation case using a computer modelling group (CMG) and two actual coalbed methane wells. Finally, the sensitivities of influencing factors on the coal seam pressure are analyzed. The results show that good agreements were obtained between the calculated coal seam pressures using the proposed method and those from the CMG-GEM simulation case and actual CBM wells, with the relative errors all being less than 1%. When ignoring the influence of critical desorption pressure and mistaking pd for pi as well as ignoring Cs, the relative error can reach as high as 31.3%. The main factors affecting the coal seam pressure are the critical desorption pressure and free gas saturation. The proposed method is simple to use, and without shutting-in the well, it can provide an important basis for production performance evaluation and development strategies.},

Accurate modeling and estimation of voltage fluctuations are crucial to informed DESS dispatch decisions. However, existing parametric probabilistic approaches have limitations in handling complex uncertainties, since they always rely on predefined distributions and complex inference processes. To address this, we integrate the patch time series Transformer model with the non-parametric Huberized composite quantile regression method to reliably predict voltage fluctuation without distribution assumptions. Comparative simulations on the IEEE 33-bus distribution network show that the proposed model reduces the DESS dispatch cost by 6.23% compared to state-of-the-art parametric models.},

ABSTRACT = {Shale reservoirs typically exhibit high density, necessitating the use of horizontal wells and hydraulic fracturing techniques for efficient extraction. Proppants are commonly employed in hydraulic fracturing to prevent crack closure. However, limited research has been conducted on the impact of shale mineral composition and proppant filling patterns on shale stress sensitivity. In this study, shale cylindrical core samples from two different lithologies in Jimusaer, Xinjiang in China were selected. The mineral composition and microscopic structures were tested, and a self-designed stress sensitivity testing system was employed to conduct stress sensitivity tests on natural cores and fractured cores with different proppant filling patterns. The experimental results indicate that the stress sensitivity of natural shale porous cores is weaker, with a stress sensitivity coefficient below 0.03, significantly lower than that of fractured cores. The shale mineral composition has a significant impact on stress sensitivity, with the stress sensitivity of clayey argillaceous shale cores, characterized by higher clay mineral content, being higher than that of sandy argillaceous shale, characterized by higher quartz mineral content. This pattern is also applicable to fractured cores filled with proppants, but the difference gradually diminishes with increased proppant concentration. The choice of large particles and high-concentration proppant bedding can enhance crack conductivity. Within the experimental range, the crack conductivity of 20–40 mesh quartz sand is more than three times that of 70–120 mesh quartz sand. At an effective stress of 60 MPa, the conductivity of cores with a proppant concentration of 2 kg/m2 is 3.61 times that of cores with a proppant concentration of 0.3 kg/m2. Under different particle size combinations of proppant filling patterns, the crack conductivity at the crack front with large-particle proppants is 6.21 times that of mixed bedding. This study provides valuable insights for the hydraulic fracturing design of shale reservoirs and optimization of production system parameters in subsequent stages.},

ABSTRACT = {In view of the high salinity characteristics of reinjection oilfield wastewater in the Gasi Block of Qinghai Oilfield, with the polymer produced by Shandong Baomo as the research target, we systematically investigated the variations in the impact of six ions, Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Fe2+, and Fe3+, in the produced water from polymer flooding on the viscosity and stability of the polymer solution. Additionally, we provided the primary research methods for complexation in reinjected wastewater. Experimental results indicate that the main factors leading to a decrease in polymer viscosity are high-valence cations, with the descending order of their influence being Fe2+ > Fe3+ > Mg2+ > Ca2+ > Na+ > K+. High-valent cations also effect the viscosity stability of polymer solutions, and their order from greatest to least impact is: Fe2+ > Ca2+(Mg2+) > Fe3+ > Na+(K+). This article is focused on investigating the influencing factors and extent of the impact of oilfield wastewater on the viscosity of polymer solutions. It illustrates the response mechanism of cations to the viscosity of polymer solutions in reinjection wastewater polymerization. Through this research, the goal is to provide reference control indicators and limits for the water quality of injected polymers at oilfield sites. This ensures the stability and controllability of polymers in field applications and offers theoretical guidance for polymer flooding technology.},

ABSTRACT = {The reservoir in the Anyue gas field, located in the Sichuan basin of China, belongs to the second member of the Dengying formation and has distinctive geological features. It is characterized by strong heterogeneity, low porosity, low permeability, and locally developed natural fractures. The reservoir space consists primarily of corrosion holes, natural fractures, and similar voids. Moreover, the lower reservoir exhibits high water saturation and a homogeneous bottom-water interface. Since it is a carbonate-based hydrocarbon reservoir with low porosity and permeability, deep acid fracturing has proven to be an efficient method for enhancing individual well production. However, the reconstruction of the second member of the Dengying formation reservoir poses significant challenges. The reservoir contains high-angle natural fractures, small vertical stress differences, and is located in close proximity to the gas–water interface. As a result, it becomes difficult to control the height of the acid break. Improper acid break treatment may easily result in water production affecting gas well production. To explore ways to control the longitudinal extension of acid fractures, 3D numerical models focusing on the initiation and expansion of acid fractures have been developed. This model takes into account geological and engineering factors such as stress differences, acid fracture displacements and scales, and their effects on the longitudinal extension of acid fractures. It was revealed that the pressure difference is the main controlling factor for the acid fracture height, followed by the reservoir thickness, the interlayer thickness, and the viscosity of the working fluid. Technical countermeasures for controlled fracture and high-acid fracturing tailored to different reservoir characteristics have been proposed, and design parameters for controlled fracture and high-acid fracturing can be optimized. By effectively controlling the vertical extension of the acid fracture, it is possible to maximize production from a single well while avoiding interference from the lower water layer. This study provides theoretical guidance for the application of deep-acid-fracturing techniques in low-permeability bottom-water gas reservoirs.},

ABSTRACT = {Adequate power load data are the basis for establishing an efficient and accurate forecasting model, which plays a crucial role in ensuring the reliable operation and effective management of a power system. However, the large-scale integration of renewable energy into the power grid has led to instabilities in power systems, and the load characteristics tend to be complex and diversified. Aiming at this problem, this paper proposes a short-term power load transfer forecasting method. To fully exploit the complex features present in the data, an online feature-extraction-based deep learning model is developed. This approach aims to extract the frequency-division features of the original power load on different time scales while reducing the feature redundancy. To solve the prediction challenges caused by insufficient historical power load data, the source domain model parameters are transferred to the target domain model utilizing Kendall’s correlation coefficient and the Bayesian optimization algorithm. To verify the prediction performance of the model, experiments are conducted on multiple datasets with different features. The simulation results show that the proposed model is robust and effective in load forecasting with limited data. Furthermore, if real-time data of new energy power systems can be acquired and utilized to update and correct the model in future research, this will help to adapt and integrate new energy sources and optimize energy management.},

ABSTRACT = {The research on the deep coalbed methane (CBM) in the Ordos Basin is mostly concentrated on the eastern margin of the basin. The geological resources of the Benxi Formation in the Yulin area, located in the central-eastern part, cover 15,000 × 108 m3, indicating enormous resource potential. However, the characteristics of the reservoir distribution and the favorable areas are not yet clear. This research comprehensively performed data logging, coal rock experiments, and core observations to identify the geological characteristics of the #8 coal seam, using a multi-level fuzzy mathematics method to evaluate the favorable area. The results indicate the following: (1) The thickness of the #8 coal in the Yulin Block ranges from 2.20 m to 11.37 m, with depths of between 2285.72 m and 3282.98 m, and it is mainly underlain by mudstone; the gas content ranges from 9.74 m3/t to 23.38 m3/t, showing a northwest–low and southeast–high trend. The overall area contains low-permeability reservoirs, with a prevalence of primary structural coal. (2) A multi-level evaluation system for deep CBM was established, dividing the Yulin Block into three types of favorable areas. This block features a wide range of Type I favorable areas, concentrated in the central-eastern, northern, and southwestern parts; Type II areas are closely distributed around the edges of Type I areas. The subsequent development process should prioritize the central-eastern part of the study area. The evaluation system established provides a reference for selecting favorable areas for deep CBM and offers theoretical guidance for targeted exploration and development in the Yulin area.},

ABSTRACT = {The dynamic model of cavitation bubbles serves as the foundation for the study of all cavitation phenomena. Solving the cavitation bubble dynamics equation can better elucidate the physical principles of bubble dynamics, assisting with the design of hydraulic machinery and fluid control. This paper employs a fourth-order explicit Runge–Kutta numerical method to solve the translational Keller–Miksis model for cavitation bubbles. It analyzes the collapse time, velocity, as well as the motion and force characteristics of bubbles under different wall distances γ values. The results indicate that as the distance between the cavitation bubble and the wall decreases, the cavitation bubble collapse time increases, the displacement of the center of mass and the amplitude of translational velocity of the cavitation bubble increase, and the minimum radius of the cavitation bubble gradually decreases linearly. During the stage when the cavitation bubble collapses to its minimum radius, the Bjerknes force and resistance experienced by the bubble also increase as the distance to the wall decreases. Especially in the cases where γ = 1.3 and 1.5, during the rebound stage of the bubble, the Bjerknes force and resistance increase, causing the bubble to move away from the wall. Meanwhile, this study proposes a radiation pressure coefficient to characterize the radial vibration behavior of cavitation bubbles when analyzing the radiation sound pressure. It is found that the wall distance has a relatively minor effect on the radiation pressure coefficient, providing an important basis for future research on the effects of different scale bubbles and multiple bubbles. The overall idea of this paper is to numerically solve the bubble dynamics equation, explore the characteristics of bubble dynamics, and elucidate the specific manifestations of physical quantities that affect bubble motion. This provides theoretical references for further engineering applications and flow analysis.},

ABSTRACT = {It is of great significance to investigate the flow rate and stress distribution of multi-fracture propagation for the optimization of perforation parameters and fracture parameters. Considering the coupling of rock deformation, fracture direction and fluid flow in multi-fracture scenarios, a mathematical model and solution program for the flow and stress distribution of multiple fractures are established, and the analytical model is used for comparison and verification. The effects of perforation cluster number, cluster spacing, perforation diameter on fracture extension trajectory, fracture width, flow rate of each fracture and stress field are studied by the model. The results show that, as the number of perforating clusters increases, the inner fracture is inhibited more severely with less width, length and flow distribution, as well as lower bottom hole pressure. With the increase in cluster spacing, the stress interference between whole fractures is weakened and the flow distribution of the inner fracture is increased with lower bottom hole pressure. With the decrease in perforation diameter, the inhibition effect of inside fractures is weakened, while the inhibition effect of outside fractures, the flow distribution of inside fractures and the bottom hole pressure are increased. The uniform propagation of multiple fractures can be promoted by decreasing the perforation clusters’ number and perforation diameter or increasing fracture spacing.},

ABSTRACT = {As the proportion of renewable energy installations in modern power systems increases, major weather events can easily trigger significant fluctuations in new energy generation and electricity load, presenting the system with the dual challenges of ensuring power supply and renewable energy consumption. Traditional dispatch models need more coordination and optimization of flexible resources under major weather events and risk management of system operations. This study focuses on provincial-level transmission systems, aiming to achieve the coordinated and optimized dispatch of flexible resources across multiple time scales in response to the complex and variable environments faced by the system. Firstly, by profoundly analyzing the response mechanisms of power systems during major weather events, this study innovatively proposes an event-driven day-ahead and intra-day optimal dispatch strategy for power systems. This strategy can sense and respond to major weather events in the day-ahead phase and adjust dispatch decisions in real time during the intra-day phase, thereby comprehensively enhancing the adaptability of power systems to sudden weather changes. Secondly, by considering the variability of renewable energy sources and electricity demand in the day-ahead and intra-day dispatch plans, the strategy ensures efficient and reliable power system operation under normal and major weather event scenarios. Finally, the method’s effectiveness is validated using actual data from a provincial-level power grid in China. The proposed dispatch strategy enhances the resilience and adaptability of power systems to major weather events, which are becoming increasingly frequent and severe due to climate change. The research demonstrates that an event-driven day-ahead and intra-day optimal dispatch strategy can enhance the economic efficiency and robustness of power system operations through the coordinated dispatch of flexible resources during major weather events, thereby supporting the transition toward sustainable energy systems that are resilient against the challenges of a changing climate.},

ABSTRACT = {To characterize the failure of rock mass surrounding underground tunnels, biaxial compression tests were conducted on a real sandstone model with a straight-walled arched hole. The acoustic emission (AE) system and digital image correlation (DIC) optical inspection equipment were used to investigate the crack evolution process and failure precursors of the tunnel. A two-dimensional particle flow code (PFC2D) was used to conduct numerical simulations on the sample, so as to investigate the mesoscopic failure mechanism of rock mass. The results show that the failure of the single tunnel constructed in sandstone occurs mainly in the walls on both sides (between the spandrels and arch feet), showing slabbing failure characteristics and a certain abruptness. The crack initiation in sandstone in early stage is not obvious, and the crack propagation in rock mass is rapid when acoustic emissions are enhanced. The small increments in the AE count and amplitude and the continuous reduction in the b-value can be used as precursors for the failure of rock mass. When the height–span ratio is 0.8 and 1.0, the stress distribution around the chamber is more uniform, and when the height–span ratio is greater than 1.0, the stress is mainly concentrated in the vault and arch bottom. In the PFC simulations, tensile fractures firstly initiate in the middle of walls and at the arch feet, arcuate fracture concentration zones are then formed, in which shear fractures appear and a few particles spall from the surfaces. When approaching the ultimate bearing capacity, rock masses on both sides of the tunnel are fractured over large areas, and the slender coalesced fractured zone develops to the deep part of rock mass, causing failure of the sample.},

ABSTRACT = {In response to the challenges of global warming and the development of A low-carbon economy, the integrated electricity and natural gas energy system (IEGES) is known as an important structure for future energy supply; thus, its planning and design must take low-carbon and environmental protection factors into account. Regarding carbon emissions as an optimization criterion, this paper built life-cycle carbon emission models of IEGES components. Then, taking the capacities of the energy resources, storage and conversion units of IEGES as the optimization variables, a multi-objective optimization configuration model was established considering the annual investment operation cost and the life-cycle carbon emissions. The multi-objective model was transformed into a single-objective one by an ε-constraint approach and the polynomial fitting method was employed to obtain the value of ε for obtaining uniformly distributed Pareto sets. Based on the fuzzy entropy weight method and the fuzzy affiliation degree approach, the obtained Pareto sets were ranked and the solution with the highest ranking value was selected as the optimal solution for the original problem. Finally, the configuration schemes were analyzed from the perspectives of economy, carbon emission and renewable energy utilization, and the effectiveness and rationality of the proposed optimization method were verified through MATLAB simulation.},

ABSTRACT = {In order to detect abnormal heat generation in time, a reversible color-changing coating temperature measurement method is proposed for self-detection of temperature by power equipment, and its adhesion characteristics and aging performance were analyzed. The results showed that the reversible color-changing coating prepared with crystalline violet lactone as the colorant, bisphenol A as the color developer, octadecanol as the solvent, and RTV-II as the base paint can meet the requirements of self-detection of temperature by power equipment with its adhesion performance. The accelerated aging tests using high temperature, light and humidity were carried out in the laboratory, and we concluded that the deterioration degree of the color-changing coating was positively correlated with the temperature. Light can accelerate the aging rate of reversible color-changing coatings, and the degradation process of the coating was significantly accelerated under UV light. The effect of humidity on the coating was not significant. The degradation of the coating after aging for 288 h under indoor conditions was small, while it was accelerated under outdoor natural conditions. This research can provide a reference for the on-site application of reversible color-changing coatings for self-detection of temperature by power equipment.},

ABSTRACT = {The intrusion of micrometer-sensitive contaminant particles into the clearance of sliding valves within hydraulic fluids is one of the root causes of valve sticking and reliability issues in hydraulic systems. To reveal the transient process and characteristics of particle intrusion into the clearance process, this paper proposes a numerical method for fluid–particle one-way coupling and verifies it through experimentation. Furthermore, a numerical simulation of the motion trajectory of spherical iron particles inside the valve chamber was conducted in a two-dimensional flow model. It was discovered that in a steady-state flow field with a certain valve opening, micrometer-sized particles in the valve chamber’s hydraulic fluid mainly move with the valve flow stream, and the number of micron particles invading the slide valve clearance and the probability of invasion is related to the slide valve opening and differential pressure. When the slide valve opening decreases, especially in the small opening state, the probability of particles invading the slide valve clearance will increase dramatically, and the probability of invading the clearance is as high as 27% in a valve opening of 50 μm; the larger the pressure difference between the valve ports, the more the number of particles invading the slide valve clearance increases; the particles in the inlet of the slide valve clearance are more prone to invade the slide valve clearance, and invade in an inclined way, touching the wall and then bouncing back. These findings are of great value for the design of highly reliable hydraulic control valves and the understanding of the mechanism of slide valve stalls and provide an important scientific basis for the optimization and improvement in the reliability of hydraulic systems.},

ABSTRACT = {A novel micro-dispersed-gel (MDG)-strengthened-alkali-compound flooding system was proposed for enhanced oil recovery in high-water-cut mature oilfields. Micro-dispersed gel has different adaptability and application schemes with sodium carbonate and sodium hydroxide. The MDG-strengthened-alkali flooding system can reduce the interfacial tension to an ultra-low interfacial-tension level of 10−2 mN/m, which can reverse the wettability of rock surface. After 30 days aging, the MDG-strengthened-Na2CO3 flooding system has good viscosity retention of 74.5%, with an emulsion stability of 79.13%. The enhanced-oil-recovery ability of the MDG-strengthened-Na2CO3 (MDGSC) flooding system is 43.91%, which is slightly weaker than the 47.78% of the MDG-strengthened-NaOH (MDGSH) flooding system. The crude-oil-production mechanism of the two systems is different, but they all show excellent performance in enhanced oil recovery. The MDGSC flooding system mainly regulates and seals micro-fractures, forcing subsequent injected water to enter the low-permeability area, and it has the ability to wash the remaining oil in micro-fractures. The MDGSH flooding system mainly removes the remaining oil on the rock wall surface in the micro-fractures by efficient washing, and the MDG particles can also form weak plugging of the micro-fractures. The MDG-strengthened-alkali flooding system can be used as an alternative to enhance oil recovery in high-water-cut and highly heterogeneous mature oilfields.},

ABSTRACT = {As the power market system gradually perfects, the increasingly fierce competition not only drives industry development but also brings new challenges. Reactive power optimization is crucial for maintaining stable power grid operation and improving energy efficiency. However, the implementation of plant–grid separation policies has kept optimization costs high, affecting the profit distribution between power generation companies and grid companies. Therefore, researching how to effectively reduce reactive power optimization costs, both technically and strategically, is not only vital for the economic operation of the power system but also key to balancing interests among all parties and promoting the healthy development of the power market. Initially, the study analyzes and compares the characteristic curves of synchronous generators and DFIGs, establishes a reactive power pricing model for generators, and considering the randomness and volatility of wind energy, establishes a DFIG reactive power pricing model. The objective functions aimed to minimize the cost of reactive power purchased by generators, the price of active power network losses, the total deviation of node voltages, and the depreciation costs of discrete variable actions, thereby establishing a dynamic reactive power optimization model for power systems including doubly-fed wind farms. By introducing Logistic chaotic mapping, the CSA is improved by using the highly stochastic characteristics of chaotic systems, which is known as the Chaotic Cuckooing Algorithm. Meanwhile, the basic cuckoo search algorithm was improved in terms of adaptive adjustment strategies and global convergence guidance strategies, resulting in an enhanced cuckoo search algorithm to solve the established dynamic reactive power optimization model, improving global search capability and convergence speed. Finally, using the IEEE 30-bus system as an example and applying the improved chaotic cuckoo search algorithm for solution, simulation results show that the proposed reactive power optimization model and method can reduce reactive power costs and the number of discrete device actions, demonstrating effectiveness and adaptability. When the improved chaotic cuckoo algorithm is applied to optimize the objective function, the optimization result is better than 7.26% compared to the standard cuckoo search algorithm, and it is also improved compared to both the PSO algorithm and the GWO algorithm.},

ABSTRACT = {In order to improve the consumption of renewable energy and reduce the carbon emissions of integrated energy systems (IESs), this paper proposes an optimal operation strategy for an integrated energy system considering the coordination of electricity and hydrogen in the context of carbon trading. The strategy makes full use of the traditional power-to-gas hydrogen production process and establishes a coupling model comprising cogeneration and carbon capture equipment, an electrolytic cell, a methane reactor, and a hydrogen fuel cell. Taking a minimum daily operating cost and minimal carbon emissions from the system as objective functions, a mixed-integer nonlinear optimal scheduling model is established. This paper designs examples based on MATLAB R2021b and uses the GUROBI solver to solve them. The results show that compared with the traditional two-stage operation process, the optimization method can reduce the daily operation cost of an IES by 26.01% and its carbon emissions by 90.32%. The results show that the operation mode of electro-hydrogen synergy can significantly reduce the carbon emissions of the system and realize a two-way flow of electro-hydrogen energy. At the same time, the addition of carbon capture equipment and the realization of carbon recycling prove the scheduling strategy’s ability to achieve a low-carbon economy of the scheduling strategy.},

ABSTRACT = {The evaluation of flow dynamics in fractured shale oil reservoirs presents significant challenges due to the complex pore configurations and high organic material concentration. Conventional methods for petrophysical and fluid dynamic evaluations are insufficient in addressing these complexities. However, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) technology is an effective technique for quantitatively delineating fluid micro-transport properties across the reservoir core. This study presents an experimental methodology rooted in NMR technology to quantify the flow capabilities within the shale oil matrix. This approach incorporates high-pressure saturation flow experiments across seven distinct core samples to gauge the micro-transport phenomena of fluids across various pore dimensions. The results revealed that under high-pressure saturation, shale cores devoid of fractures demonstrated an average crude oil saturation rate of merely 19.44%. Cores with evident stratification exhibited a 16.18% increase in flow capacity compared to their non-stratified counterparts. The flow dynamics within these shale reservoirs exhibited a range of behaviors, from non-linear to linear. In lower-permeability zones, non-linear patterns became increasingly apparent. An NMR T2 spectrum analysis was used to identify the minimum effective pore size conducive to shale oil flow within the matrix, which was between 8 and 10 nanometers. These insights provide a foundation for a deeper understanding of the mechanisms behind oil and gas migration in fractured shale oil matrices, offering valuable insight into their extractive potential.},

ABSTRACT = {In response to the limitations of existing evaluation methods for gas well types in tight sandstone gas reservoirs, characterized by low indicator dimensions and a reliance on traditional methods with low prediction accuracy, therefore, a novel approach based on a two-dimensional convolutional neural network (2D-CNN) is proposed for predicting gas well types. First, gas well features are hierarchically selected using variance filtering, correlation coefficients, and the XGBoost algorithm. Then, gas well types are determined via spectral clustering, with each gas well labeled accordingly. Finally, the selected features are inputted, and classification labels are outputted into the 2D-CNN, where convolutional layers extract features of gas well indicators, and the pooling layer, which, trained by the backpropagation of CNN, performs secondary dimensionality reduction. A 2D-CNN gas well classification prediction model is constructed, and the softmax function is employed to determine well classifications. This methodology is applied to a specific tight gas reservoir. The study findings indicate the following: (1) Via two rounds of feature selection using the new algorithm, the number of gas well indicator dimensions is reduced from 29 to 15, thereby reducing the computational complexity of the model. (2) Gas wells are categorized into high, medium, and low types, addressing a deep learning multi-class prediction problem. (3) The new method achieves an accuracy of 0.99 and a loss value of 0.03, outperforming BP neural networks, XGBoost, LightGBM, long short-term memory networks (LSTMs), and one-dimensional convolutional neural networks (1D-CNNs). Overall, this innovative approach demonstrates superior efficacy in predicting gas well types, which is particularly valuable for tight sandstone gas reservoirs.},

ABSTRACT = {In the process of water displacing oil within mobile pipelines, it is common that the oil tends to accumulate at the elevated sections of inclined pipelines, leading to an issue of residual oil accumulation. In this paper, the mechanism of carrying accumulated oil out of the pipeline with water flow is discussed. Taking the residual oil layer in down-hill pipelines as a research object, a hydrodynamic model of the water-oil displacement process is established based on the theory of liquid–liquid two-phase flow and the application of the momentum transfer equation. It has been found that the use of this model can enhance the computational speed by 15% without affecting the accuracy of the calculations. Subsequently, the model is used to analyze the impact of different initial water-phase velocities, inclination angles, initial oil-phase heights, and pipeline diameters on the oil-carrying process of water flow. The results indicate that increasing the initial water-phase velocity, the angle of inclination, and the initial oil-phase height all enhance the fluctuation in the oil–water interface, making it easier for the oil phase to be carried away from the pipeline. Conversely, when all other parameters are held constant, an increase in the pipeline diameter tends to stabilize the oil–water interface, thereby making it more difficult for the residual oil to be carried away by the water flow.},

ABSTRACT = {This study investigates the impact of nanomaterials on different surfactant solutions. By measuring the parameters (including emulsification property, zeta potential, DLS, CA, IFT, etc.) of imbibition liquid system with nanoparticles and without nanoparticles, combining with imbibition experiments, the law and mechanism of improving the imbibition recovery of nanomaterials were obtained. The findings demonstrate that the nano-silica sol enhances the emulsification and dispersion of crude oil in the surfactant system, resulting in smaller and more uniform particle sizes for emulsified oil droplets. Non-ionic surfactant AEO-7 has the best effect under the synergistic action of nanomaterials. Zeta potential and DLS tests also showed that AEO-7 exhibits smaller particle sizes due to their insignificant electrostatic interaction with nanoparticles. Furthermore, the addition of nanomaterials enhances the hydrophilicity of core and reduces the interfacial tension. Under the synergistic action of nanoparticles, AEO-7 still showed the best enhanced core hydrophilicity (CA 0.61° after imbibition) and the lowest interfacial tension (0.1750 mN·m−1). In the imbibition experiment, the imbibition recovery of the system with nanomaterials is higher than that of the non-nanomaterials. The mixed system of AEO-7 and nano-silica sol ZZ-1 has the highest imbibition recovery (49.27%). Combined with the experiments above, it shows that nanomaterials have a good effect on enhancing the recovery rate of tight core, and the synergistic effect of non-ionic surfactant AEO-7 with nanomaterials is the best. Moreover, nanomaterials reduce adhesion work within the system while improving spontaneous imbibition recovery. These findings provide theoretical guidance for better understanding the mechanism behind nanomaterial-induced imbibition enhancement as well as improving tight oil’s imbibition recovery.},

ABSTRACT = {Biaxial compression tests based on an elliptical tunnel were conducted to study the failure characteristics and the meso-crack evolution mechanism of tunnels with different cross-sections constructed in sandstone. The progressive crack propagation process around the elliptical tunnel was investigated using a real-time digital image correlation (DIC) system. Numerical simulations were performed on egg-shaped, U-shaped, and straight-walled arched tunnels based on the mesoscopic parameters of the elliptical tunnel and following the principle of an equal cross-sectional area. The meso-crack evolution and stress conditions of the four types of tunnels were compared. The results show that (1) fractures around an elliptical tunnel were mainly distributed at the end of the long axis and mainly induce slabbing failure, and the failure mode is similar to a V-shaped notch; (2) strain localization is an important characteristic of rock fracturing, which forebodes the initiation, propagation, and coalescence paths of macro-cracks; and (3) the peak loads of tunnels with egg-shaped, U-shaped, and straight-walled arched cross-sections are 98.76%, 97.56%, and 90.57% that of an elliptical cross-section. The elliptical cross-section shows the optimal bearing capacity.},

ABSTRACT = {Polymer-plugging agents are widely employed in profile control and water-plugging measures, serving as a crucial component for efficient reservoir development. However, quantitatively monitoring the emplacement depth of polymer-plugging agents in low-permeability and high-permeability layers remains a challenging bottleneck. Presently, insufficient attention on shear thinning, a critical rheological property for water shut-off and profile control, has limited our understanding of polymer distribution laws. In this study, polymer shear-thinning experiments are firstly conducted to explore polymer variations with flow rate. The novelty of the research is that varying polymer viscosity is implemented instead of the fixed-fluid viscosity that is conventionally used. The fitted correlation is then integrated into the 2D and 3D heterogeneous numerical models for simulations, and a multivariate nonlinear regression analysis is performed based on the simulation results. The results show that lower polymer emplacement depth ratios corresponded to higher viscosity loss rates under the same flow rate. An increase in the initial permeability ratio corresponds to a decrease in the emplacement ratio, along with a reduction in the fraction of the plugging agent penetrating the low permeability formations. The model was applied to the Kunan Oilfield and demonstrated a polymer reduction of approximately 3000 tons compared to traditional methods. Despite the slightly complex nature of the multivariate nonlinear mathematical model, it presents clear advantages in controlling plugging agent distribution and estimating dosage, laying good theoretical ground for the effective and efficient recovery of subsurface resources.},

ABSTRACT = {The propagation of hydraulic fractures is highly influenced by the geological structure of the reservoir in unconventional reservoirs, such as natural fractures. In this paper, a new fluid–solid coupling dynamic model was built which presents the failure mechanism of hydraulic fracture with pre-existing simple and complex natural fractures. The cohesive element method and the maximum principal stress fracture criterion were used in the new model. An analysis was conducted to investigate the impact of various factors, including encounter angle, in situ stress, elastic modulus, and Poisson’s ratio, on the propagation of hydraulic fractures. The simulation results indicate that the encounter angle and the in situ stress are the main factors affecting the fracture morphology. When the encounter angle and the in situ stress difference are small, hydraulic fractures propagate along natural fractures. When the elastic modulus is small, it is advantageous for the advancement of both hydraulic and natural fractures. The Poisson’s ratio has a slight effect on the fracture propagation pattern.},

ABSTRACT = {Due to the impact of global warming and climate change, more and more people are starting to have a clearer understanding and vigilance about greenhouse gases. To prevent further deterioration of the global environment, this study examines the coefficients of performance of 21 currently available refrigerants with very low global-warming potential and zero ozone-depleting potential under evaporation temperatures of 10, −20, −40, and −60 °C and condensation temperatures of 30, 40, and 50 °C, respectively. It is found that the use of pure refrigerant in a two-stage refrigeration system to replace the single-stage refrigeration system, in addition to mixing it into an appropriate mixture, can effectively improve the performance coefficient of the refrigeration system. For single-stage vapor compression refrigeration systems, R1234ze(Z), R601, and R1233zd(E) have the best refrigeration performances among the environmentally friendly refrigerants studied, while R441A performs the worst for Teva = 10 °C and −20 °C. Moreover, RE170 has the highest COP of the refrigeration system for Teva = −40 °C and −60 °C. However, R1234yf performs worse in COP when the evaporation temperature is lower, and it ranks last for Teva = −60 °C. When a double-stage vapor compression refrigeration system is employed instead, the percentage increase in the COP of the system using R1234yf becomes the largest for Teva = −40 °C and −60 °C. However, the growth rate of R717 ranks last for Teva = −60 °C. For an R717/R1234yf mixture at an optimum mass fraction of 0.25, the COP of the refrigeration system can be increased up to 25.8% despite an increase of 15.2% in operating pressure compared to R1234yf. The discharge temperature may rise; however, there will be no overheating problem for the compressor.},

ABSTRACT = {Proppant transport and distribution law in hydraulic fractures has important theoretical and field guidance significance for the optimization design of hydraulic fracturing schemes and accurate production prediction. Many studies aim to understand proppant transportation in complex fracture systems. Few studies, however, have addressed the flow path mechanism between the transverse fracture and horizontal well, which is often neglected in practical design. In this paper, a series of mathematical equations, including the rock elastic deformation equation, fracturing fluid continuity equation, fracturing fluid flow equation, and proppant continuity equation for the proppant transport, were established for the transverse fracture of a horizontal well, while the finite element method was used for the solution. Moreover, the two-dimensional radial flow was considered in the proppant transport modeling. The results show that proppant breakage, embedding, and particle migration are harmful to fracture conductivity. The proppant concentration and fracture wall roughness effect can slow down the proppant settling rate, but at the same time, it can also block the horizontal transportation of the proppant and shorten the effective proppant seam length. Increasing the fracturing fluid viscosity and construction displacement, reducing the proppant density and particle size, and adopting appropriate sanding procedures can all lead to better proppant placement and, thus, better fracturing and remodeling results. This paper can serve as a reference for the future study of proppant design for horizontal wells.},

ABSTRACT = {Kuwait stands as one of the hottest locations globally, experiencing scorching temperatures that can soar to 50 °C during the summer months. Conversely, in the winter months of December and January, temperatures may plummet to less than 10 °C. Maintaining a comfortable temperature indoors necessitates a substantial amount of energy, particularly during the scorching summer seasons. In Kuwait, most of the electrical energy required for functions such as air conditioning and lighting is derived from fossil fuel resources, contributing to escalating air pollution and global warming. To reduce dependence on conventional energy sources for heating and cooling, this article presents a case study to explore the potential of using geothermal energy for space heating and cooling in Kuwait. The case study involves utilizing a geothermal heat pump (water-sourced heat pump) in conjunction with a vertical-borehole ground heat exchanger (VBGHE). The mentioned system is deployed to regulate the climate in a six-floor apartment block comprising a small two-bedroom apartment on each level, each with a total floor area of 57 m2. Two geothermal heat pumps, each with a cooling capacity of 2.58 kW and a heating capacity of 2.90 kW, connected to two vertical-borehole heat exchangers, were deployed for each apartment to maintain temperatures at 22 °C in winter and 26 °C in summer. The findings indicate that the estimated annual energy loads for cooling and heating for the apartment block are 42,758 kWh and 113 kWh, respectively. The corresponding electrical energy consumption amounted to 9294 kWh for space cooling and 113 kWh for space heating. The observed peak cooling load was approximately 9300 kJ/h (2.58 kW) per apartment, resulting in a power density of 45 W/m2. Moreover, the HP system achieved a 22% reduction in annual electric energy consumption compared to conventional air conditioning systems. This reduction in electric energy usage led to an annual CO2 reduction of 6.6 kg/m2.},

ABSTRACT = {The physical properties of shale reservoirs are typically poor, necessitating the use of fracturing technology for effective development. However, the high clay content prevalent in shale formations poses significant challenges for conventional hydraulic fracturing methods. To address this issue, CO2-based fracturing fluid has been proposed as an alternative to mitigate the damage caused by water-based fracturing fluids. In this paper, the applicability of quasi-dry CO2 fracturing in shale reservoirs is examined from three key perspectives: the viscosity of CO2 fracturing fluid, the fracture characteristics induced by the CO2 fracture fluid, and the potential reservoir damage caused by the fracturing fluid. Firstly, the viscosity of CO2 fracturing fluid was determined by a rheological experiment. Rheological tests revealed that the viscosity of CO2 fracturing fluid was significantly influenced by the water–carbon ratio. Specifically, when the water–carbon ratio was 30:70, the maximum viscosity observed could reach 104 mPa·s. Moreover, increasing reservoir temperature resulted in decreased fracturing fluid viscosity, with a 40 °C temperature rise causing a 20% viscosity reduction. Secondly, matrix permeability tests were conducted to investigate permeability alteration during CO2 fracturing fluid invasion. Due to the weak acidity of CO2-based fracturing fluid, the permeability reduction induced by clay hydration was inhibited, and an increase in permeability was observed after a 3-day duration. However, the matrix permeability tends to decrease as the interaction time is prolonged, which means prolonged soaking time can still cause formation damage. Finally, triaxial fracturing experiments facilitated by a three-axis servo pressure device were conducted. The fracture properties were characterized using computed tomography (CT), and 3D reconstruction of fractured samples was conducted based on the CT data. The results demonstrate that CO2 fracturing fluid effectively activates weak cementation surfaces in the rock, promoting the formation of larger and more complex fractures. Hence, CO2 quasi-dry fracturing technology emerges as a method with significant potential, capable of efficiently stimulating shale reservoirs, although a reasonable soaking time is necessary to maximize hydrocarbon production.},

ABSTRACT = {For over four decades, carbon dioxide (CO2) has been instrumental in enhancing oil extraction through advanced recovery techniques. One such method, water alternating gas (WAG) injection, while effective, grapples with limitations like gas channeling and gravity segregation. To tackle the aforementioned issues, this paper proposes an upgrade coupling method named alkaline-surfactant-polymer alternating gas (ASPAG). ASP flooding and CO2 are injected alternately into the reservoir to enhance the recovery of the WAG process. The uniqueness of this method lies in the fact that polymers could help profile modification, CO2 would miscible mix with oil, and alkaline surfactant would reduce oil–water interfacial tension (IFT). To analyze the feasibility of ASPAG, a couples model considering both gas flooding and ASP flooding processes is established by using the CMG-STARS (Version 2021) to study the performance of ASPAG and compare the recovery among ASPAG, WAG, and ASP flooding. Our research delved into the ASPAG’s adaptability across reservoirs varying in average permeability, interlayer heterogeneity, formation rhythmicity, and fluid properties. Key findings include that ASPAG surpasses the conventional WAG in sweep and displacement efficiency, elevating oil recovery by 12–17%, and in comparison to ASP, ASPAG bolsters displacement efficiency, leading to a 9–11% increase in oil recovery. The primary flooding mechanism of ASPAG stems from the ASP slug’s ability to diminish the interfacial tension, enhancing the oil and water mobility ratio, which is particularly efficient in medium-high permeability layers. Through sensitivity analysis, ASPAG is best suited for mid-high-permeability reservoirs characterized by low crude oil viscosity and a composite reverse sedimentary rhythm. This study offers invaluable insights into the underlying mechanisms and critical parameters that influence the alkaline-surfactant-polymer alternating gas method’s success for enhanced oil recovery. Furthermore, it unveils an innovative strategy to boost oil recovery in medium-to-high-permeability reservoirs.},

ABSTRACT = {Abnormal conditions greatly reduce the efficiency of hydraulic fracturing of unconventional gas reservoirs. Optimizing the fracturing scheme is crucial to minimize the likelihood of abnormal operational conditions, such as pressure channeling, casing deformation, and proppant plugging. This paper proposes a novel machine learning-based method for optimizing abnormal conditions during hydraulic fracturing of unconventional natural gas reservoirs. Firstly, the main controlling factors of abnormal conditions are selected through a hybrid controlling analysis, upon which a surrogate model is established for predicting the occurrence probability of abnormal conditions, rather than whether abnormal conditions happen or not. Subsequently, a machine learning-based optimization algorithm is developed to minimize the occurrence probability of abnormal conditions, acknowledging their inevitability during the fracturing process. The optimal results demonstrate the proposed method outperforms traditional methods, on average. The proposed methodology is more in line with the needs of practical operation in an environment full of uncertainty.},

ABSTRACT = {We aimed to investigate the corrosion patterns and the main controlling factors of N80 steel and P110 steel tubing under different sections. Conducting weight loss corrosion experiments for 168 h using high-temperature and high-pressure autoclaves to simulate the corrosion behavior of two types of casing materials, N80 steel and P110 steel, in different well sections under specific conditions of CO2 content, chloride ion concentration, temperature, pressure, and sulfate-reducing bacteria population in highly mineralized formation water. X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) were used to analyze the corrosion products, surface morphology, and elemental composition of the two steel pipes. Additionally, 3D microscopy was employed to observe the morphology and measure the dimensions of localized corrosion pits. Under different well sections, the corrosion products formed on N80 steel and P110 steel mainly consist of FeCO3, and crystalline salts of chlorides present in the solution medium. Under low-water-cut conditions, narrow and deep corrosion defects were observed, while narrow and shallow corrosion defects were found under high-water-cut conditions. In the upper wellbore section, both steel pipes exhibited dispersed and thin corrosion product films that suffered from rupture and detachment, resulting in severe localized corrosion. In the middle wellbore section, the corrosion product film on N80 steel comprised irregularly arranged polygonal grains, some of which exhibited significant gaps, leading to extremely severe corrosion. For P110 steel, the corrosion product film was also dispersed and thin, with extensive detachment and extremely severe corrosion. In the lower wellbore section, both steel pipes were covered with a dense layer of grains, with smaller gaps between them, effectively protecting the metal matrix from corrosion. Consequently, the corrosion rate decreased compared to the middle section but still exhibited severe corrosion. In low-water-cut conditions, attention should be given to the risk of column safety due to corrosion from condensate water and CO2, as well as the size of narrow and deep corrosion defects in the middle wellbore section. In high-water-cut conditions, it is recommended to use corrosion inhibitors in combination while focusing on SRB bacteria corrosion in the upper wellbore section, condensate water in the middle section, CO2 content and chloride ion coupling in the lower section, and the size of narrow and shallow corrosion defects causing column safety risks.},

Given the NP-Hard nature of scheduling problems due to their combinatorial complexity, this study employs a data-driven optimization approach. Initially, historical operational data relevant to the SCOO are scrutinized; however, due to data limitations, small-scale instances are solved using a mathematical programming model to generate data. Subsequently, operational solution data are processed using the Apriori algorithm, a renowned data mining technique. The insights gained are translated into heuristic rules, laying the groundwork for a novel data-driven heuristic algorithm tailored for the SCOO problem. This algorithm is then applied to a 45-day scheduling scenario, demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed approach.},

ABSTRACT = {The accurate prediction of gas well production is one of the key factors affecting the economical and efficient development of tight gas wells. The traditional oil and gas well production prediction method assumes strict conditions and has a low prediction accuracy in actual field applications. At present, intelligent algorithms based on big data have been applied in oil and gas well production prediction, but there are still some limitations. Only learning from data leads to the poor generalization ability and anti-interference ability of prediction models. To solve this problem, a production prediction method of tight gas wells based on the decline curve and data-driven neural network is established in this paper. Based on the actual production data of fractured horizontal wells in three tight gas reservoirs in the Ordos Basin, the prediction effect of the Arps decline curve model, the SPED decline curve model, the MFF decline curve model, and the combination of the decline curve and data-driven neural network model is compared and analyzed. The results of the case analysis show that the MFF model and the combined data-driven model have the highest accuracy, the average absolute percentage error is 14.11%, and the root-mean-square error is 1.491, which provides a new method for the production prediction of tight gas wells in the Ordos Basin.},

ABSTRACT = {In this work, an experimental analysis of the performance of a cross-flow turbine, commonly referred to as a Michell–Banki turbine (MBT), is carried out for small-scale hydropower production in rural areas located in developing countries to support their social and economic development activities. The study investigates how the efficiency of the MBT is influenced by the presence or absence of a nozzle, along with variations in the internal guide vane (GV) and its angle. The runner had 26 blades that were arranged symmetrically in the periphery between two circular plates. The designed MBT had the ability to generate a maximum of 100 W of power at a water flow rate and a head of 0.009 m3/s and 0.6311 m, respectively. The experimental tests were carried out using a hydraulic bench. The turbine efficiency without the inner GV was found to be higher than that of the turbine with the inner GV; i.e., it was found that the utilization of the GV did not enhance the efficiency of the MBT due to the occurrence of a choking effect. A maximum hydraulic efficiency of 85% was achieved in the turbine without an inner GV in comparison with the efficiency achieved (77%) with this device and an optimum opening angle of the GV of 24° (75% of opening). In this regard, the GV design should be carefully carried out to improve the MBT efficiency. Additionally, the effect of the GV shape on the MBT performance should be experimentally investigated to obtain a more general judgment regarding the role of this device.},

ABSTRACT = {The feasibility of an adsorbent material like biochar (BC) depends on its regeneration capacity and its ability to achieve high removal efficiencies on real wastewater (WW) effluents. In this study, the regeneration capacity of the Pinus patula BC previously used in the removal of Indigo Carmine from water was evaluated. The regeneration technique that resulted in the highest desorption efficiency was a thermo-chemical method that consisted of heating the spent BC in a stove at 160 °C for 45 min followed by regeneration with ethanol (C2H6O) at a concentration of 75% for 6 h. Through this regeneration method, it was found that Pinus patula BC could be used in seven consecutive adsorption–desorption cycles. The feasibility of this BC was also assessed by evaluating the adsorbent’s efficiency in real textile WW. Under optimal operational conditions (solution pH = 3, BC dose = 13.5 g/L, and BC particle size = 300–450 µm), the highest removal efficiencies in terms of colour and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were 81.3 and 76.8%, respectively, for 120 min of treatment. The results obtained in the regeneration studies and the treatment of real textile WW suggested that the use of Pinus patula BC could be suitable to be scaled to an industrial level, contributing to sustainable development and the circular bioeconomy by using a waste to solve the dye pollution problem of another waste.},

ABSTRACT = {With the application of CO2 fracturing, CO2 huff and puff, CO2 flooding, and other stimulation technologies in shale reservoirs, a large amount of CO2 remained in the formation, which also lead to the serious corrosion problem of CO2 in shale reservoirs. In order to solve the harm caused by CO2 corrosion, it is necessary to curb CO2 corrosion from the cementing cement ring to ensure the long-term stable exploitation of shale oil. Therefore, a new latex was created using liquid polybutadiene, styrene, 2-acrylamide-2-methylpropanesulfonic acid, and maleic anhydride to increase the cement ring’s resistance to CO2 corrosion. The latex’s structure and characteristics were then confirmed using infrared, particle size analyzer, thermogravimetric analysis, and transmission electron microscopy. The major size distribution of latex is between 160 and 220 nm, with a solid content of 32.2% and an apparent viscosity of 36.8 mPa·s. And it had good physical properties and stability. Latex can effectively improve the properties of cement slurry and cement composite. When the amount of latex was 8%, the fluidity index of cement slurry was 0.76, the consistency index was 0.5363, the free liquid content was only 0.1%, and the water loss was reduced to 108 mL. At the same time, latex has a certain retarding ability. With 8% latex, the cement slurry has a specific retarding ability, is 0.76 and 0.5363, has a free liquid content of just 0.1%, and reduces water loss to 108 mL. Moreover, latex had certain retarding properties. The compressive strength and flexural strength of the latex cement composite were increased by 13.47% and 33.64% compared with the blank cement composite. A long-term CO2 corrosion experiment also showed that latex significantly increased the cement composite’s resilience to corrosion, lowering the blank cement composite’s growth rate of permeability from 46.88% to 19.41% and its compressive strength drop rate from 27.39% to 11.74%. Through the use of XRD and SEM, the latex’s anti-corrosion mechanism, hydration products, and microstructure were examined. In addition to forming a continuous network structure with the hydrated calcium silicate and other gels, the latex can form a latex film to attach and fill the hydration products. This slows down the rate of CO2 corrosion of the hydration products, enhancing the cement composite’s resistance to corrosion. CO2-resistant toughened latex can effectively solve the CO2 corrosion problem of the cementing cement ring in shale reservoirs.},

Furthermore, the multiple energy storage model for power and heat storage in parks is established, which includes lithium batteries and heat storage tanks. Based on this, minimizing the annual operation cost of parks is taken as the optimization goal, and the capacity optimization model for power and heat storage is constructed, which considers the investment costs, operation and maintenance costs, purchased energy costs, peak-shaving subsidy, and environmental subsidy. Finally, an industrial park is selected as an example of EPC to verify the effectiveness of our proposed investment strategy. The results show that compared with the situation before the energy-saving renovation, the park can save 35.14 ten thousand CNY in annual cost expenses. When the unit power price of the lithium battery exceeds 3900 CNY/kW, the unit capacity price exceeds 5460 CNY/kWh, the unit power price of the heat storage tank (HST) exceeds 6000 CNY/kW, and the unit capacity price exceeds 1000 CNY/kWh, the configuration of the lithium battery and HST in the park is no longer the optimal choice to perform the energy-saving renovation.},

ABSTRACT = {Sub-critical water is an environment-friendly solvent. It is widely used for the extraction of various organic compounds. It can be used to dissolve and transport organic matter in oil shale. In this study, the conversion of oil shale was synergistically catalyzed by the addition of Fe or Ni to the Fe inherent in samples under sub-critical water conditions. Oil shale can be converted to gas, oil and residues of oil. Thermogravimetric (TG) analysis results presented that the weight loss of raw oil shale was up to 15.85%. After sub-critical water extraction, the weight loss rate of the residues was reduced to 8.41%. With the application of a metal catalyst, Fe or Ni, the weight loss of residues was further reduced to 7.43% and 6.57%, respectively. According to DTG curves, it was found that there were two weight-loss rate peaks. The decomposition process of kerogen in oil shale could be divided into two cracking processes. One is decomposed at a high velocity at around 420 °C, and another is decomposed at a low velocity at around 515 °C. Gas chromatography (GC) results of gas products indicated that Fe or Ni could contribute to producing normal alkanes, such as methane, ethane, propane, etc., which are produced by the hydrogenation of alkenes via hydrogen transfer during the conversion process of kerogen. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS) was conducted to analyze the components of the liquid products. The results showed that n-alkanes, iso-alkane, oxygenated hydrocarbons and aromatic compounds were the major components of the kerogen cracking products. When Ni was introduced as a catalyst, the contents of aromatic compounds and oxygenated hydrocarbons in the liquid products were increased from 19.55% and 6.87% to 22.38% and 13.77%, respectively. This is due to the synergistic effect of the addition of Ni with the inherent Fe in oil shale under sub-critical water which ensures kerogen is more easily cracked to produce aromatic compounds and oxygenated hydrocarbons.},

ABSTRACT = {An accurate wind shear model is an important prerequisite in extrapolating the wind resource from lower heights to the increasing hub height of wind turbines. Based on the 1-year dataset (collected in 2014) consisting of 15-minute intervals collected at heights of 2, 10, 50, 100, and 150 m on an anemometer tower in northern China, the present study focuses on the time-varying relationship between the wind shear coefficient (WSC) and atmospheric stability and proposes a wind shear model considering atmospheric stability. Through the relationship between Monin–Obukhov (M-O) length and gradient Richardson number, the M-O length is directly calculated by wind data, and the WSC is calculated by combining the Panofsky and Dutton (PD) models, which enhances the engineering practicability of the model. Then, the performance of the model is quantified and compared with two alternative methods: the use of annual average WSC and the use of stability change WSC extrapolation. The analysis demonstrates that the proposed model outperforms the other approaches in terms of normal root mean square error (NRMSE) and normal bias (NB). More specifically, this method reduces the NRMSE and NB by 24–29% and 76–95%, respectively. Meanwhile, it reaches the highest extrapolation accuracy under unstable and stable atmospheric conditions. The results are verified using the Weibull distribution.},

ABSTRACT = {The implementation of CO2 huff-n-puff in unconventional oil reservoirs represents a green development technology that integrates oil recovery and carbon storage, emphasizing both efficiency and environmental protection. A rational well selection method is crucial for the success of CO2 huff-n-puff development. This paper initially identifies eight parameters that influence the effectiveness of CO2 huff-n-puff development and conducts a systematic analysis of the impact of each factor on development effectiveness. A set of factors for well selection decisions is established with seven successful CO2 huff-n-puff cases. Subsequently, the influencing factors are classified into positive, inverse, and moderate indicators. By using an exponential formulation, a method for calculating membership degrees is calculated to accurately represent the nonlinearity of each parameter’s influence on development, resulting in a dimensionless fuzzy matrix. Furthermore, with the oil exchange ratio serving as a pivotal parameter reflecting development effectiveness, recalibration of weighting factors is performed in conjunction with the dimensionless fuzzy matrix. The hierarchical order of weighting factors, from primary to secondary, is as follows: porosity, reservoir temperature, water saturation, formation pressure, reservoir thickness, crude oil density, crude oil viscosity, and permeability. The comprehensive decision factor and oil exchange ratio exhibit a positive correlation, affirming the reliability of the weighting factors. Finally, utilizing parameters of the Ordos Basin as a case study, the comprehensive decision factor is calculated, with a value of 0.617, and the oil exchange ratio is predicted as 0.354 t/t, which falls between the Chattanooga and Eagle Ford reservoirs. This approach, which incorporates exponential membership degrees and recalibrated weighting factors derived from actual cases, breaks the limitations of linear membership calculation methods and human factors in expert scoring methods utilized in existing decision-making methodologies. It furnishes oilfield decision-makers with a swifter and more precise well selection method.},

ABSTRACT = {Industrial boilers cause significant energy wastage that could be mitigated with oxy-fuel combustion versus traditional air combustion. Despite several feasibility studies on oxy-fuel burners, they are widely avoided in industry due to major infrastructural challenges. This study measured the performance and heat transfer characteristics of each component in a 0.5 MW fire tube gas boiler after retrofitting it with an oxy-fuel burner. Comparisons were drawn across three combustion modes—air combustion, oxy-fuel combustion, and oxy-fuel flue gas recirculation (FGR). The Dittus–Boelter equation was employed to predict heat transfer in the fire tube for all combustion modes at full load (100%). Heat transfer in the latent heat section of the economizer was measured and compared with predictions using the Zukauskas equation. With this retrofit, oxy-fuel combustion improved the thermal efficiency by about 3–4%. In oxy-fuel combustion, the flow rate of exhaust gas decreased. When integrated into an existing fire tube boiler, the fire tube’s heat transfer contribution diminished greatly, suggesting the economic viability of a redesigned, reduced fire tube section. Additionally, a new design could address the notable increase in gas radiation from the fire tube in oxy-fuel and FGR, as well as aid in the efficient recovery of condensation heat from exhaust gases.},

ABSTRACT = {The accurate calculation of the hotspot temperature of the cable intermediate joint can effectively guarantee the safe operation of the transmission and distribution network. This paper addresses the limitations of the current method of estimating hotspot temperature solely from surface temperature measurements. Specifically, we focus on a 110 kV single-core cable as our subject of study. We started by establishing a simulation model for the temperature field at the intermediate joint to generate data samples. Subsequently, the NCA (neighborhood component analysis) algorithm was employed to select the optimal measurement points on the cable’s surface. This allowed determination of the quantity and location of characteristic points. Finally, we developed a cascading inversion model, which consists of a radial inversion model and an axial inversion model, based on the extreme learning machine algorithm. The example results show that the mean squared error of hotspot temperature obtained by cascade inversion and direct inversion is 6.95 and 24.71, respectively, indicating that cascade inversion can effectively improve the inversion accuracy.},

ABSTRACT = {Further exploitation of the residual oil underground in post-polymer flooded reservoirs is attractive and challenging. Microbial-enhanced oil recovery (MEOR) is a promising strategy to enhance the recovery of residual oil in post-polymer flooded reservoirs. Identifying and selectively activating indigenous microorganisms with oil displacement capabilities is an urgent requirement in the current design of efficient microbial-enhanced oil recovery technologies. This study combines high-throughput sequencing with functional network analysis to identify the core functional microbes within the reservoirs. Concurrently, it devises targeted activation strategies tailored to oligotrophic conditions through an analysis of environmental factor influences. The feasibility of these strategies is then validated through physical simulation experiments. With nutrient stimulation, the overall diversity of microorganisms decreases while the abundance of functional microorganisms increases. The core displacement results showed that the oil recovery factor increased by 3.82% on the basis of polymer flooding. In summary, this research has established a system for the efficient activation of functional microorganisms under oligotrophic conditions by utilizing bioinformatics, network analysis, and indoor simulation systems. This achievement will undoubtedly lay a solid foundation for the practical implementation of microbial enhancement techniques in the field.},

ABSTRACT = {Horizontal-well multi-cluster fracturing is one of the most important techniques for increasing the recovery rate in unconventional oil and gas reservoir development. However, under the influence of complex induced stress fields, the mechanism of interaction and propagation of fractures within each segment remains unclear. In this study, based on rock fracture criteria, combined with the boundary element displacement discontinuity method, a two-dimensional numerical simulation model of hydraulic fracturing crack propagation in a planar plane was established. Using this model, the interaction and propagation process of inter-cluster fractures under different fracturing sequences within horizontal well segments and the mechanism of induced stress field effects were analyzed. The influence mechanism of cluster spacing, fracture design length, and fracture internal pressure on the propagation morphology of inter-cluster fractures was also investigated. The research results indicate that, when using the alternating fracturing method, it is advisable to appropriately increase the cluster spacing to weaken the inhibitory effect of induced stress around the fractures created by prior fracturing on subsequent fracturing. Compared to the alternating fracturing method, the propagation morphology of fractures under the symmetrical fracturing method is more complex. At smaller cluster spacing, fractures created by prior fracturing are more susceptible to being captured by fractures from subsequent fracturing. The findings of this study provide reliable theoretical support for the optimization design of fracturing sequences and fracturing processes in horizontal well segments.},

ABSTRACT = {Due to its unique chemical structure, hydrogen energy inherently has a high calorific value without reinforcing global warming, so it is expected to be a promising alternative energy source in the future. In this work, we focus on nanoconfined hydrogen flow performance, a critical issue in terms of geological hydrogen storage. For nanopores where the pore scale is comparable to hydrogen’s molecular size, the impact on hydrogen molecules exerted by the pore surface cannot be neglected, leading to the molecules near the surface gaining mobility and slipping on the surface. Furthermore, hydrogen adsorption takes place in the nanopores, and the way the adsorption molecules move is completely different from the bulk molecules. Hence, the frequently applied Navier–Stokes equation, based on the no-slip boundary condition and overlooking the contribution of the adsorption molecules, fails to precisely predict the hydrogen flow capacity in nanopores. In this paper, hydrogen molecules are classified as bulk molecules and adsorption molecules, and then models for the bulk hydrogen and the adsorption hydrogen are developed separately. In detail, the bulk hydrogen model considers the slip boundary and rarefaction effect characterized by the Knudsen number, while the flow of the adsorption hydrogen is driven by a chemical potential gradient, which is a function of pressure and the essential adsorption capacity. Subsequently, a general model for the hydrogen flow in nanopores is established through weight superposition of the bulk hydrogen flow as well as the adsorption hydrogen, and the key weight coefficients are determined according to the volume proportion of the identified area. The results indicate that (a) the surface diffusion of the adsorption molecules dominates the hydrogen flow capacity inside nanopores with a pore size of less than 5 nm; (b) improving the pressure benefits the bulk hydrogen flow and plays a detrimental role in reducing surface diffusion at a relatively large pressure range; (c) the nanoconfined hydrogen flow conductance with a strong adsorption capacity (PL = 2 MPa) could reach a value ten times greater than that with a weak adsorption capacity (PL = 10 MPa). This research provides a profound framework for exploring hydrogen flow behavior in ultra-tight strata related to adsorption phenomena.},

ABSTRACT = {In order to further understand the complex spatial distribution caused by the extremely strong heterogeneity of buried hill reservoirs, this paper proposes a new method for predicting the development pattern of buried hill reservoirs based on the traditional pre-drilling prediction and post-drilling evaluation methods that mainly rely on seismic, logging, and core data, which are difficult to meet the timeliness and accuracy of drilling operations. Firstly, the box method and normalization formula are used to process and normalize the abnormal data of element logging and engineering logging, and then the stepwise regression analysis method is used to optimize the sensitive parameters of element logging and engineering logging. The Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) algorithm, deep neural network (DNN), and support vector machine (SVM) are used to establish a new method for predicting the development pattern of buried hill reservoirs. Lastly, a comprehensive evaluation index F1 score for the model is established to evaluate the prediction model for the development pattern of buried hill reservoirs. The F1 score value obtained from this model’s comprehensive evaluation index indicates that the LightGBM model achieves the highest accuracy, with 96.7% accuracy in identifying weathered zones and 95.8% accuracy in identifying interior zones. The practical application demonstrates that this method can rapidly and accurately predict the development mode of buried hill reservoirs while providing a new approach for efficient on-site exploration and decision-making in oil and gas field developments. Consequently, it effectively promotes exploration activities as well as enhances the overall process of oil and gas reservoir exploration.},

ABSTRACT = {The performance and quality of steel products are significantly impacted by the alloying element control. The efficiency of alloy utilization in the steelmaking process was directly related to element yield. This study analyses the factors that influence the yield of elements in the steelmaking process using correlation analysis. A yield prediction model was developed using a t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) algorithm, a whale optimization algorithm (WOA), and a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network. The t-SNE algorithm was used to reduce the dimensionality of the original data, while the WOA optimization algorithm was employed to optimize the hyperparameters of the LSTM neural network. The t-SNE-WOA-LSTM model accurately predicted the yield of Mn and Si elements with hit rates of 71.67%, 96.67%, and 99.17% and 57.50%, 89.17%, and 97.50%, respectively, falling within the error range of ±1%, ±2%, and ±3% for Mn and ±1%, ±3%, and ±5% for Si. The results demonstrate that the t-SNE-WOA-LSTM model outperforms the backpropagation (BP), LSTM, and WOA-LSTM models in terms of prediction accuracy. The model was applied to actual production in a Chinese plant. The actual performance of the industrial application is within a ±3% error range, with an accuracy of 100%. Furthermore, the elemental yield predicted by the model and then added the ferroalloys resulted in a reduction in the elemental content of the product by 0.017%. The model enables accurate prediction of alloying element yields and was effectively applied in industrial production.},

ABSTRACT = {The advancement of photovoltaic module (PV) enhancer technology shows significant promise due to its rapid growth. Nevertheless, there remains a requirement for ongoing research to refine the evaluation techniques for this technology. In a prior investigation, the concept of the area and cost-effectiveness factor, denoted as FCAE, was introduced to analyze the economic impact of enhancing the PV through techniques such as reflectors or coolers. This metric relates the surface area and manufacturing expenses of a PV enhancer to its capacity for improving the PV output power, aiding in the comparison of different enhancer types. However, this assessment approach is costly, requiring a set of PVs without enhancers to be compared with an equal number of modules fitted with enhancers. This paper introduces a modified version of this metric, termed the modified area and cost-effectiveness factor (FMCAE), along with its minimum value (FMCAE,min), with the aim of reducing the assessment expenses associated with PV enhancers. This modification hinges on knowing the output power from a single solar cell without an enhancer, as well as from a PV with an enhancer containing a known number of solar cells. Additionally, it relies on data regarding the manufacturing cost of the PV enhancer, the cost of one watt of PV power, and the combined surface area of the PV and its enhancer. The equations for computing the total number of solar cells and the associated costs in addition to the expenses cost are also proposed for FCAE and FMCAE. The results of the present study using FMCAE show that there is a proportional relationship between the percentage of solar cell saving and the number of solar cells. As the solar cells increase, the percentage of solar sell saving increases. The findings reveal that utilizing FMCAE leads to a 48.33% increase in the proportion of solar cells saved compared to the existing method. It can be concluded that the proposed method is cost-efficient and holds promise for adoption by PV enhancer designers and manufacturers.},

ABSTRACT = {To reveal the mechanism of hydraulic fracture initiation and propagation under the conditions of multiple perforations during horizontal well fracturing, we creatively conducted dual-hole fracturing experiments on small rock samples and established a two-dimensional model of a single cluster with multiple perforations in a horizontal well based on the extended finite element method using the fluid–solid coupling equation, which was combined with the basic theory of damage mechanics. The biggest difference from previous research is that this model does not consider the hypothesis of stress shadows and only focuses on studying the initiation and propagation of multiple perforations in one cluster. We studied the effects of perforation parameters, stress state, and injection flow rate on the initiation and propagation of hydraulic fractures using this model. The experimental and simulation results indicate that under multi-perforation conditions, the number of fractures depends on the number of perforations. The simulation results show that when the spacing between perforations increases or the number of perforations reduces, the initiation time of perforation is advanced and the interference between fractures weakens, which is conducive to the initiation and propagation of hydraulic fractures. As the stress difference increases, the initiation time of perforation becomes earlier and the deflection angle of the outermost fractures becomes smaller, which is conducive to the parallel expansion of the fractures. Moreover, although this has little impact on the morphology of fractures with the rise in flow rate in simulation, it is beneficial for improving the initiation and propagation speed of fractures. The length of fractures also increases significantly at the same time point. In addition, both the experiments and simulations revealed that an increase in the flow rate could accelerate the initiation time of fractures. The proposed model can guide fracturing construction to optimize the design of perforation spacing during horizontal well fracturing, which can contribute to reducing development costs and improving the final production.},

ABSTRACT = {In the process of the large-scale hydraulic fracturing of a shale gas field in the Weiyuan area of Sichuan province, the quantitative description and evaluation of hydraulic fracture expansion morphology and the three-dimensional distribution law are the key points of evaluation of block fracturing transformation effect. Many scholars have used the finite element method, discrete element method, grid-free method and other numerical simulation methods to quantitatively characterize hydraulic fractures, but there are often the problems that the indoor physical simulation results are much different from the actual results and the accuracy of most quantitative studies is poor. Considering rock mechanics parameters and based on the displacement discontinuity method (DDM), a single-stage multi-cluster fracture propagation model of horizontal well was established. The effects of Young’s modulus, Poisson’s ratio, the in situ stress difference, the approximation angle, the perforation cluster number and the perforation spacing on the formation of complex fracture networks and on the geometrical parameters of hydraulic fractures were simulated. The research results can provide theoretical reference and practical guidance for the optimization of large-scale fracturing parameters and the quantitative post-fracturing evaluation of horizontal wells in unconventional reservoirs such as shale gas reservoirs.},

ABSTRACT = {In Romania, natural gas production is concentrated in two large producers, OMV Petrom and Romgaz. However, there are also smaller companies in the natural gas production area. In these companies, the deposits are mostly mature, or new deposits have low production capacity. Thus, the production forecast is very important for the continued existence of these companies. The model is based on the pressure variation in the gas reservoir, and the exponential model with production decline is currently used by gas and oil producers. Following the variation in the production of the gas wells, we found that in many cases, the Gaussian and Hubbert forecast models are more suitable for simulating the production pattern of gas wells. The models used to belong to the category of poorly conditioned models, with little data, usually called gray models. Papers published in this category are based on data collected over a period of time and provide a forecast of the model for the next period. The mathematical method can lead to a very good approximation of the known data, as well as short-term forecasting in the continuation of the time interval, for which we have these data. The neural network method requires more data for the network learning stage. Increasing the number of known variables is conducive to a successful model. Often, we do not have this data, or obtaining it is expensive and uneconomical for short periods of possible exploitation. The network model sometimes captures a fairly local pattern and changing conditions require the model to be remade. The model is not valid for a large category of gas wells. The Hubbert and Gauss models used in the article have a more comprehensive character, including a wide category of gas wells whose behavior as evolutionary stages is similar. The model is adapted according to practical observations by reducing the production growth period; the layout is asymmetric around the production peak; and the production range is reduced. Thus, an attempt is made to replace the exponential model with the Hubbert and Gauss models, which were found to be in good agreement with the production values. These models were completed using the Monte Carlo method and matrix of risk evaluation. A better appreciation of monthly production, which is an important aspect of supply contracts, and cumulative production, which is important for evaluating the utility of the investment, is ensured. In addition, we can determine the risk associated with the realization of production at a certain moment of exploitation, generating a complete picture of the forecast over the entire operating interval. A comparison with production results on a case study confirms the benefits of the forecasting procedure used.},

They are indispensable devices for measuring flow. Currently, research has primarily focused on gas–liquid two-phase flow within the flowmeter, giving limited attention to the impact of solid phases. In practical applications, crude oil frequently contains solid particles and other impurities, leading to equipment deformation and a subsequent reduction in measuring accuracy. This paper investigates how particle dynamic parameters affect the erosion evolution characteristics of flowmeters operating in solid–liquid two-phase conditions, employing the dynamic boundary erosion prediction method. The results indicate that the erosion range and peak erosion position on the overcurrent wall of the solid–liquid two-phase flowmeter vary with different particle dynamic parameters. Erosion mainly occurs at the contraction section of the solid–liquid two-phase flowmeter. When the particle inflow velocity increases, the erosion range shows no significant change, but the peak erosion position shifts to the right, primarily due to the evolution of the erosion process. With an increase in particle diameter, the erosion range expands along the inlet direction due to turbulent diffusion, as particles with lower kinetic energy exhibit better followability. There is no significant change in the erosion range and peak erosion position with an increase in particle volume fraction and particle sphericity. With a particle inflow velocity of 8.4 m/s, the maximum erosion depth reaches 750 μm. In contrast, at a particle sphericity of 0.58, the minimum erosion depth is 251 μm. Furthermore, a particle volume fraction of 0.5 results in a maximum flow coefficient increase of 1.99 × 10−3.},

ABSTRACT = {Due to their efficient renewable energy consumption performance, AC/DC hybrid microgrids have become an important development form for future power grids. However, the fault response will be more complex due to the interconnected structure of AC/DC hybrid microgrids, which may have a serious influence on the safe operation of the system. Based on an AC/DC hybrid microgrid with an integrated bidirectional power converter, research on the interaction impact of faults was carried out with the purpose of enhancing the safe operation capability of the microgrid. The typical fault types of the DC sub-grid were selected to analyze the transient processes of fault circuits. Then, AC current expressions under the consideration of system interconnection structure were derived and, on this basis, we obtained the response results of non-fault subnets under the fault process, in order to reveal the mechanism of DC fault propagation. Subsequently, a current limitation control strategy based on virtual impedance control is proposed to address the rapid increase in the DC fault current. On the basis of constant DC voltage control in AC/DC hybrid microgrids, a virtual impedance control link was added. The proposed control strategy only needs to activate the control based on the change rate of the DC current, without additional fault detection systems. During normal operations, virtual impedance has a relatively small impact on the steady-state characteristics of the system. In the case of a fault, the virtual impedance resistance value is automatically adjusted to limit the change rate and amplitude of the fault current. Finally, a DC fault model of the AC/DC hybrid microgrid was built on the RTDS platform. The simulation and experimental results show that the control strategy proposed in this paper can reduce the instantaneous change rate of the fault state current from 19.1 kA/s to 2.73 kA/s, and the error between the calculated results of equivalent modeling and simulation results was within 5%. The obtained results verify the accuracy of the mathematical equivalent model and the effectiveness of the proposed current limitation control strategy.},

ABSTRACT = {Electric vehicle (EV) charging facilities are essential to their development and deployment. These days, autonomous microgrids that use renewable energy resources to energize charging stations for electric vehicles alleviate pressure on the public electricity grid. Nevertheless, controlling and managing such charging stations’ energy is difficult due to the nonlinearity and irregular character of renewable energy sources. The current research recommends using a Brain Emotional Learning Intelligent Control (BELBIC) controller to enhance an autonomous EV charging station’s performance and power management. The charging station uses a battery to store energy and is primarily powered by photovoltaic (PV) solar energy. The principles of BELBIC are dependent on emotional cues and sensory inputs, and they are based on an emotion processing system in the brain. Noise and parameter variations do not affect this kind of controller. In this study, the performance of a conventional proportional–integral (PI) controller and the suggested BELBIC controller is evaluated for variations in solar insolation. The various parts of an EV charging station are simulated and modelled by the MATLAB/Simulink framework. The findings show that, in comparison to the conventional PI controller, the suggested BELBIC controller greatly enhances the transient responsiveness of the EV charging station’s performance. The EV keeps charging while the storage battery perfectly saves and keeps steady variations in PV power, even in the face of any PV insolation disturbances. The suggested system’s simulation results are provided and scrutinized to confirm the concept’s suitability. The findings validate the robustness of the suggested BELBIC control versus parameter variations.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, a solar thermochemical reactor is designed based on a 5 kW non-coaxial concentrating solar simulator, and a mathematical model is established for thermal calculations. The calculated temperature distribution is used as a load condition for thermal stress analyses. The model is used to study the influence of the solar simulator power, solar reactor inner wall material’s emissivity, working pressure, gas inlet velocity, and thermocouple opening diameter on the thermal stress of the solar reactor. The results show that thermal stress increases with the increase in solar simulator power and the emissivity of the inner wall material in the solar reactor. The inlet velocity and working pressure have little effect on the thermal stress of the reactor and cannot prevent damage to the reactor. In the case of maintaining the diameter of the thermocouple at the front end of the reactor, increasing the diameter of the thermocouple inside the reactor leads to an increase in thermal stress around the reactor. Meanwhile, using a finer thermocouple can reduce the thermal stress inside the reactor and extend its service life, which will provide a foundation for designing practical industrial applications in the future.},

ABSTRACT = {Carbon dioxide (CO2) miscible fracturing huff-and-puff technology now plays a pivotal role in enhancing crude oil recovery rates, particularly in reservoirs with challenging physical properties, strong water sensitivity, high injection pressure, and complex water-injection dynamics. In this study, the oil-increasing mechanism and huff-and-puff effect of CO2 miscible fracturing fluid are investigated through a comprehensive experimental approach. Specifically, experiments on PVT gas injection expansion, minimum miscible pressure, and CO2 miscible fracturing fluid huff and puff are conducted on the G fault block reservoir of the J Oilfield. The experimental findings demonstrate that injecting CO2 into reservoirs leads to an expansion in oil volume, a reduction in viscosity, and an increase in saturation pressure. Crude oil extraction is further enhanced by the addition of solubilizers and viscosity reducers. The use of solubilizers not only increases oil recovery rates but also reduces the minimum miscible pressure required for effective CO2 dispersion. We also found that shut-in times, permeability, and the huff-and-puff method used all have considerable impacts on huff-and-puff recovery rates. This study offers valuable technical insights, supporting the application of CO2 miscible fracturing huff-and-puff technology to enhance oil recovery rates in low-permeability reservoirs.},

ABSTRACT = {The expansion of renewable electricity storage technologies, including green hydrogen storage, is spurred by the need to address the high costs associated with hydrogen storage and the imperative to increase storage capacity. The initial section of the paper examines the intricacies of storing electricity generated from renewable sources, particularly during peak periods, through green hydrogen. Two primary challenges arise: firstly, the complexity inherent in the storage technology and its adaptation for electricity reproduction; and secondly, the cost implications throughout the technological chain, resulting in a significant increase in the price of the reproduced energy. Electric energy storage emerges as a pivotal solution to accommodate the growing proportion of renewable energy within contemporary energy systems, which were previously characterized by high stability. During the transition to renewable-based energy systems, optimizing energy storage technology to manage power fluctuations is crucial, considering both initial capital investment and ongoing operational expenses. The economic analysis primarily focuses on scenarios where electricity generated from renewable sources is integrated into existing power grids. The subsequent part of this paper explores the possibility of localizing excess electricity storage within a specific system, illustrated by domestic hot water.},

ABSTRACT = {Fracture network fracturing is pivotal for achieving the economical and efficient development of shale gas, with the connectivity among fracture networks playing a crucial role in reservoir stimulation effectiveness. However, flow back data that reflect fracture network connectivity information are often ignored, resulting in an inaccurate prediction of the effective fracture network volume (EFNV). The accurate calculation of the EFNV has become a key and difficult issue in the field of shale fracturing. For this reason, the accurate shale gas effective fracture network volume inversion method needs to be improved. Based on the flow back characteristics of fracturing fluids, a tree-shaped fractal fracture flow back mathematical model for inversion of EFNV was established and combined with fractal theory. A genetic algorithm workflow suitable for EFNV inversion of shale gas was constructed based on the flow back data after fracturing, and the fracture wells in southern Sichuan were used as an example to carry out the EFNV inversion. The reliability of the inversion model was verified by testing production, cumulative gas production, and microseismic results. The field application showed that the inversion method proposed in this paper can obtain tree-shaped fractal fracture network structure parameters, fracture system original pressure, matrix gas breakthrough pressure, fracture compressibility coefficient, reverse imbibition index, equivalent main fracture half length, and effective initial fracture volume (EIFV). The calculated results of the model belong to the same order of magnitude as those of the HD model and Alkouh model, and the model has stronger applicability. This research has important theoretical guiding significance and field application value for improving the accuracy of the EFNV calculation.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper investigates the heat transfer performance of flow boiling in microchannels under the dual effect of gravity and surface modification through both experimental studies and mechanistic analysis. Utilizing a test bench with microchannels featuring surfaces of varying wettability levels and adjustable flow directions, multiple experiments on R134-a flow boiling heat transfer under the effects of gravity and surface modification were conducted, resulting in 1220 sets of experimental data. The mass flux ranged from 735 kg/m2s to 1271 kg/m2s, and the heating heat flux density ranged from 9 × 103 W/m2 to 46 × 103 W/m2. The experimental results revealed the differences in the influence of different gravity and surface modification conditions on heat transfer performance. It was found that the heat transfer performance of super-hydrophilic surfaces in horizontal flow is optimal and more stable heat transfer performance is observed when gravity is aligned with the flow direction. And the impact of gravity and surface modification on heat transfer has been explained through mechanistic analysis. Therefore, two new dimensionless numbers, Fa and Conew, were introduced to characterize the dual effects of gravity and surface modification on heat transfer. A new heat transfer model was developed based on these effects, and the prediction error of the heat transfer coefficient was reduced by 12–15% compared to existing models, significantly improving the prediction accuracy and expanding its application scope. The applicability and accuracy of the new model were also validated with other experimental data.},

ABSTRACT = {During the hydraulic-fracturing process, stress interference occurs among multiple wells and fractures, potentially affecting the trajectory of hydraulic fracture propagation. Previous studies have largely overlooked the influence of proppant support stresses on the trajectories of fracture propagation. This paper establishes a mathematical model, grounded in the boundary element method, designed to compute the propagation of multiple fractures, considering both proppant support on the fracture surface and dynamic perturbations within the local stress field. The findings of this research reveal that the stress field induced by hydraulic fracturing exhibits dynamic evolution characteristics, necessitating a comprehensive study of the fracture initiation and extension across the entire fracturing time domain. The effect of the residual fracture width under proppant action on the in situ stress field cannot be ignored. During simultaneous fracturing, hydraulic fractures are inclined to propagate in the direction of the maximum horizontal principal stress, particularly as the in situ differential stress escalates. Staggered fracturing between wells has been proven to be more effective than head-to-head fracturing. Simply increasing the well spacing cannot solve the problem of inter-well fracture interference. In zipper fracturing, adjusting the fracturing sequence can inhibit the fracture intersections between wells, thereby controlling the trajectory of fracture propagation. The aforementioned research has considerable significance in guiding the control of fracture morphology during hydraulic-fracturing processes.},

ABSTRACT = {The development of renewable energy and the construction of a comprehensive energy system with multiple complementary energy sources have gradually become the main direction of China’s energy development. As the penetration rate of renewable energy increases, the intermittent and fluctuating output of wind and solar power has a more significant impact on the system. This article conducts research on the optimization configuration of integrated energy system (IES) considering photovoltaic output uncertainty under a ladder carbon trading mechanism. Firstly, a two-stage distributed robust optimization (DRO) configuration model for integrated energy system is established. In detail, a deterministic model aimed at minimizing investment costs is given in the first stage and an uncertainty model aimed at minimizing operating costs in the probability distribution of the worst scenario is built in the second stage. Then, a data-driven distributed robust optimization method is adopted to deal with the uncertainty of photovoltaic output using MATLAB software (R2020A). Finally, the column and constraint generation (C&CG) algorithm is used to solve the problem, and the optimal investment capacity and cost results of the integrated energy system considering demand response under a ladder carbon trading mechanism are obtained. Through analysis, the proposed method achieves a 5.54% reduction in carbon emission costs while maintaining nearly unchanged investment costs, thus balancing economic and environmental benefits. Additionally, the CCG algorithm can effectively improve computational efficiency and guarantee the optimality of the solution.},

ABSTRACT = {Blasting is a prevalent technique in deep rock excavation, with the state of rock fragmentation under high in-situ stress conditions being distinct from that under low in-situ stress conditions. A new material point method framework utilizing the generalized interpolated material point and convective particle domain interpolation functions was implemented to simulate the single-hole blasting process, analyze the stress distribution around the blasting hole, and elucidate the mechanism of how ground stress influences the expansion of blasting cracks through the interaction with the blasting load. In addition, the dynamic relaxation method realizes the stress’s initialization. It was concluded that the in-situ stress can increase the compressive stress induced by blasting load, whereas it decreases the caused tensile stress. With the increase in the ground stress, the scale of the cracks decreases. Under the non-isobaric condition, the blast-induced cracks preferentially expand along the high stress with the increase in the stress difference between the horizontal direction and the vertical direction, and the blast-induced cracks are suppressed to the greatest extent in the direction of the minimum ground stress.},

ABSTRACT = {During the temporary plugging fracturing (TPF) process, the pressure response and pumping behavior significantly differ from those observed during conventional fracturing fluid pumping. Once the temporary plugging agent (TPA) forms a plug, subsequent fracture initiation and propagation become more intricate due to the influence of the TPA and early fractures. Factors such as concentration, particle size, and ratio of the TPA notably affect the effectiveness of TPF. This study employs a true triaxial hydraulic fracturing simulation system to conduct TPF experiments with varying particle size combinations and concentrations at both in-fracture and in-stage locations. The impact of different TPA parameters on the plugging effectiveness is assessed by analyzing the morphology of the induced fractures and the characteristics of pressure curves post experiment. Results indicate that combining dfferent particle sizes enhances plugging effectiveness, with a combination of smaller and larger particles exhibiting superior plugging effectiveness, resulting in a pressure increase of over 25.9%. As the concentration of the TPA increases, the plugging fracture pressure rises, accompanied by rapid pressure response and significant plugging effects, leading to more complex fracture morphology. For shale reservoirs, the density of bedding planes (BPs) influences the morphology and width of conventional hydraulic fractures, thereby affecting the effectiveness of subsequent refracturing. Rock samples with a relatively low BP density demonstrate effective plugging initiation both in-fracture and in-stage, facilitating the formation of complex fracture networks. Conversely, specimens with a relatively high BP density exhibit superior plugging effectiveness in-stage compared to in-fracture plugging.},

ABSTRACT = {In inertial confinement fusion, the sub-atmospheric purging through microcapillaries is of great importance to the high gas purity inside the cryogenic target and the low failure rate of experiments. In this study, a non-continuous flow model is developed for this sub-atmospheric purging process and verified through National Ignition Facility experiments to study the evolution of parameters such as pressure and gas composition that are not possible to measure directly. The effects of microcapillary structures and sizes on the transient evacuation–filling behaviors are analyzed, and the periodic purging scheme is optimized. The results show that the extension of evacuation and filling time caused by the elongated microtube can be described as a linear function of microtube length or an exponential decay function of microtube diameter, and the change of the inner diameter has a more drastic effect. The conical-straight composite can effectively reduce the evacuation and filling time while meeting the thermal and mechanical requirements. The overall performance of the purging process exhibits a strong dependence on the cycle trough pressure. The total purging time firstly decreases and then increases with the increase in the trough pressure, and the optimal trough pressure falls at around 20% of the filling pressure where the evacuation and filling times are almost evenly balanced. These results can provide theoretical guidance for the selection of microtubes and the design of the filling–evacuating scheme in the experiments.},

ABSTRACT = {Renewable energy sources are increasingly integrated into power systems, leading to significant variability in operations. This necessitates robust methods for assessing operational reliability. We propose a novel model–data hybrid approach that incorporates endogenous uncertainty into the reliability evaluation process. First, unlike traditional methods that treat uncertainties as external factors, this approach recognizes that operational decisions can significantly influence how uncertainties are resolved and impact reliability metrics. The proposed method integrates device reliability indices with operational decision variables. This allows us to evaluate the impact of endogenous uncertainty on operational reliability through a reliability-constrained stochastic unit commitment model. Additionally, a model–data hybrid algorithm is introduced for efficient solution of the formulated optimization problem. Case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Results also show that endogenous uncertainty may cause a 10% error in power system reliability indices.},

ABSTRACT = {With the continuous deepening of oil and gas exploration and development, unconventional oil and gas resources, represented by tight oil, have become research hotspots. However, few studies have investigated tight oil potential in any systematic way in the shell limestone reservoir of the Sichuan Basin. Herein, we used thin section analysis, X-ray diffraction (XRD), high-pressure mercury intrusion, low-pressure N2 and CO2 adsorption experiments, low-field nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), focused ion beam–scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM), and nano-CT to characterize multi-porous media. The reservoir space controlled by nonfabric, shell, and matrix constitutes all the reservoir space for tight oil. The interconnected porosity was mainly distributed in the range of 1% to 5% (avg. 2.12%). The effective interconnected porosity mainly ranged from 0.5% to 2.0% (avg. 1.59%). The porosity of large fractures was 0.1% to 0.5% (avg. 0.21%). The porosity of isolated pores and bound oil–water pores was 0.2% to 0.8% (avg. 0.44%). The dissolved pores adjacent to fractures, the microfractures controlled by the shell, the microfractures controlled by the matrix, the isolated pores, and the intracrystalline pores constitute five independent pore-throat systems. The development of pores and fractures in shell limestone reservoirs are coupled on the centimeter–millimeter–micron–nanometer scale. Various reservoir-permeability models show continuous distribution characteristics. These findings make an important contribution to the exploration and exploitation of tight oil in shell limestone.},

ABSTRACT = {The interest in combined heat and solar power (CHP) systems has increased due to the growing demand for sustainable energy with low carbon emissions. An effective technical solution to address this requirement is using a parabolic trough solar collector (PTC) in conjunction with a Rankine cycle (RC) heat engine. The solar-powered Rankine cycle (SPRC) system is a renewable energy technology that can be relied upon for its high efficiency and produces clean energy output. This study describes developing a SPRC system specifically for electricity generation in Aden, Yemen. The system comprises parabolic trough collectors, a thermal storage tank, and a Rankine cycle. A 4E analysis of this system was theoretically investigated, and the effects of various design conditions, namely the boiler’s pinch point temperature and steam extraction from the high-pressure turbine, steam extraction from the intermediate-pressure turbine, and condenser temperature, were studied. Numerical simulations showed that the system produces a 50 MW net. The system’s exergetic and energy efficiencies are 30.7% and 32.4%. The planned system costs 2509 USD/h, the exergoeconomic factor is 79.43%, and the system’s energy cost is 50.19 USD/MWh. The system has a 22.47 kg/MWh environmental carbon footprint. It is also observed that the performance of the cycle is greatly influenced by climatic circumstances. Raising the boiler’s pinch point temperature decreases the system’s performance and raises the environmental impact.},

ABSTRACT = {Predicting carbon emissions is important in various sectors, including environmental management, economic planning, and energy policy. Traditional forecasting models typically require extensive training data to achieve high accuracy. However, carbon emission data are usually available on an annual basis, which is insufficient for effectively training conventional forecasting models. To address this challenge, this paper introduces an innovative carbon emissions prediction model that integrates Fibonacci attenuation particle swarm optimization (FAPSO) with the gated recurrent unit (GRU). The FAPSO algorithm is used to optimize the hyperparameters of the GRU, thereby alleviating the decline in prediction accuracy that conventional recurrent neural networks often face when dealing with limited training data. To evaluate the effectiveness of the FAPSO-GRU model, we tested it using carbon emission data from Hainan Province. Compared to the conventional GRU model, the FAPSO-GRU model achieved a significant reduction in the mean absolute error (42.27%), root mean square error (42.38%), and mean absolute percentage error (43.06%). Furthermore, we validated the FAPSO-GRU model with real data from Beijing, Guangdong, Hubei, Hunan, and Shanghai. The experimental results convincingly demonstrate that the proposed model provides a highly accurate solution for carbon emission prediction tasks, effectively addressing the limitations posed by limited training data.},

ABSTRACT = {HSG (high-sulfur gas) reservoirs are prevalent globally, yet their exploitation is hindered by elevated levels of hydrogen sulfide. A decrease in temperature and pressure may result in the formation of sulfur deposits, thereby exerting a notable influence on gas production. Test instruments are susceptible to significant corrosion due to the presence of hydrogen sulfide, resulting in challenges in obtaining bottom hole temperature and pressure test data. Consequently, a WTD (wellbore temperature distribution) model incorporating sulfur precipitation was developed based on PPP (physical property parameter), heat transfer, and GSTP (gas–solid two-phase) flow models. The comparison of a 2.53% temperature error and a 4.80% pressure error with actual field test data indicates that the established model exhibits high accuracy. An analysis is conducted on the impact of various factors, such as production, sulfur layer thickness, reservoir temperature, and reservoir pressure, on the distribution of the wellbore temperature field and pressure field. Increased gas production leads to higher wellhead temperatures. The presence of sulfur deposits reduces the flow area and wellhead pressure. A 40% concentration of hydrogen sulfide results in a 2 MPa pressure drop compared to a 20% concentration. Decreased reservoir pressure and temperature facilitate the formation of sulfur deposits at the wellhead.},

ABSTRACT = {The spray characteristics of liquid ammonia under various ambient pressures and temperatures were analyzed in a constant volume chamber to cover a wide range of superheat degrees. The injection pressure was set as 70 and 80 MPa with ambient pressure ranging from 0.2 to 4 MPa. The ambient temperature was 500 K. The results showed that the higher the injection pressure, the greater the kinetic energy obtained. The droplet fragmentation was enhanced, and the phenomenon of gradual separation of the gas–liquid region occurred with increasing injection pressure. Under flash boiling spray conditions, the spray developed faster than non-flash boiling and transition flash boiling spray under the same injection pressure. In addition, the flash boiling spray tip penetration of the gas and liquid increased more than that of cold spray, and the fluctuation of the late stage of the injection was relatively large. Therefore, the injection pressure has a greater effect on the spray tip penetration of flash boiling spray. Moreover, ambient pressure greatly influences the flare flash boiling spray. The spray resistance phenomenon was found during the spray development in the flare flash boiling condition. With the increase in ambient pressure, the spray tip penetration of flash boiling spray decreases due to the reduction in the pressure difference inside and outside the spray hole and the restriction of ambient gas. Meanwhile, owing to the low ambient pressure and ambient density, the liquid penetration in the initial phase of the flare flash boiling spray will be abnormally shorter than that of the non-flash boiling spray.},

ABSTRACT = {In order to explore the wind load characteristics acting on solar photovoltaic panels under extreme severe weather conditions, based on the Shear Stress Transport (SST) κ-ω turbulence model, numerical calculations of three-dimensional incompressible viscous steady flow were performed for four installation angles and two extreme wind directions of the solar photovoltaic panels. The wind load characteristics on both sides of the photovoltaic panels were obtained, and the vortex structure characteristics were analyzed using the Q criterion. The results indicate that, under different installation angles, the windward side pressure of the solar photovoltaic panel is generally higher than the leeward side. The leeward side is prone to forming larger vortices, increasing the fatigue and damage risk of the material, which significantly impacts the solar photovoltaic panel. As the installation angle increases, the windward side pressure of the solar photovoltaic panel also gradually increases. Therefore, optimal installation methods include installing the panel facing the wind at angles of 30° and 45°, or installing it facing away from the wind at a 60° angle, to minimize the impact of wind load on the solar photovoltaic panel.},

ABSTRACT = {Abstract: In order to enhance the heat transfer performance of a phase change thermal energy storage unit, the effects of trapezoidal fins of different sizes and arrangement modes were studied by numerical simulation in the heat storage and release processes. The optimal enhancement solution was obtained by comparing the temperature distribution, instantaneous liquid-phase ratio, solid–liquid phase diagram and comprehensive heat storage and release performance of the thermal energy storage unit under different fin sizes. During the heat storage process, the results show that when the ratio of the length of the upper and lower base of the trapezoid h1/h2 is 1:9, the heat storage time is shortened by 9.03% and 18.21% compared with h1/h2 = 3:7 and 5:5, respectively. During the heat release process, the optimal heat transfer effect is achieved when h1/h2 = 5:5. To further improve the heat transfer effects, the energy storage unit is placed upside down; then, the least time is achieved when h1/h2 = 2:8. When heat storage and release are considered together, the energy storage unit with h1/h2 = 2:8 takes the shortest time to melt in upright placement and then to solidify in upside-down placement.},

ABSTRACT = {The Gasi reservoir in the Qinghai oilfield is a typical high-temperature and high-salinity reservoir, with an average temperature and average salinity of 70.0 °C and 152,144 mg/L, respectively. For over 30 years since 1990, water flooding has been the primary method for enhancing oil recovery. Recently, the Gasi reservoir has turned into a mature oilfield. It possesses a high water cut of 76% and a high total recovery rate of 47%. However, the main developing enhanced oil recovery (EOR) technology for the development of the Gasi reservoir in the next stage is yet to be determined. Surfactant–polymer (SP) flooding, which can reduce the oil–water interfacial tension and increase the viscosity of the water phase, has been widely applied to low-temperature and low-salinity reservoirs across China in the past few decades, but it has rarely been applied to high-temperature and high-salinity reservoirs such as the Gasi reservoir. In this study, the feasibility of SP flooding for high-temperature and high-salinity reservoirs was established. Thanks to the novel surfactant and polymer products, an SP flooding formula with surfactants ZC-2/B2 and polymer BRH-325 was proposed for Gasi. The formula showed a low interfacial tension of 10−2 mN/m and a high viscosity of 18 mPa·s in simulated reservoir conditions. The oil displacement experiment demonstrated that this formula can enhance the oil recovery rate by 26.95% upon water flooding at 64.64%. This study provides a feasible EOR candidate technology for high-temperature and high-salinity reservoirs, as exemplified by the Qinghai Gasi reservoir.},
