ABSTRACT = {Hydrotreatment is an efficient method for pyrolytic oil upgrading; however, the trade-off between the operational cost on hydrogen consumption and process profit remains the major challenge for the process designs. In this study, an integrated process of steam methane reforming and pyrolytic oil hydrotreating with gas separation system was proposed conceptually. The integrated process utilized steam methane reformer to produce raw syngas without further water–gas-shifting; with the aid of a membrane unit, the hydrogen concentration in the syngas was adjusted, which substituted the water–gas-shift reactor and improved the performance of hydrotreater on both conversion and hydrogen consumption. A simulation framework for unit operations was developed for process designs through which the dissipated flow in the packed-bed reactor, along with membrane gas separation unit were modeled and calculated in the commercial process simulator. The evaluation results showed that, the proposed process could achieve 63.7% conversion with 2.0 wt% hydrogen consumption; the evaluations of economics showed that the proposed process could achieve 70% higher net profit compared to the conventional plant, indicating the potentials of the integrated pyrolytic oil upgrading process.},

ABSTRACT = {Carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) is one of the most effective technologies to reduce CO2 emissions and has attracted wide attention all over the world. This paper proposes a real option model to analyze the investment decisions of a coal-fired power plant on CCUS technologies under imperfect carbon emission trading schemes in China. Considering multiple uncertainties, which include carbon trading price volatility, carbon utilization revenue fluctuation, and changes in carbon transport and storage cost, the least squares Monte Carlo simulation method is used to solve the problems of path dependence. The research results show that the independent effects of carbon trading mechanisms on investment stimulation and emission reduction are limited. The utilization ratio of captured CO2 has significant impacts on the net present value and investment value of the CCUS project. Moreover, the investment threshold is highly sensitive to the utilization proportion of food grade CO2 with high purity. It is suggested that the Chinese government should take diverse measures simultaneously, including increasing grants for research and development of carbon utilization technologies, introducing policies to motivate investments in CCUS projects, and also improving the carbon emission trading scheme, to ensure the achievement of the carbon emission reduction target in China.},

ABSTRACT = {A numerical study is performed to investigate the effects of adding Carbon Nano Tube (CNT) and applying a magnetic field in two directions (vertical and horizontal) on the 3D-thermo-capillary natural convection. The cavity is differentially heated with a free upper surface. Governing equations are solved using the finite volume method. Results are presented in term of flow structure, temperature field and rate of heat transfer. In fact, results revealed that the flow structure and heat transfer rate are considerably affected by the magnitude and the direction of the magnetic field, the presence of thermocapillary forces and by increasing nanoparticles volume fraction. In opposition, the increase of the magnetic field magnitude leads to the control the flow causing flow stabilization by merging vortexes and reducing heat transfer rate.},

ABSTRACT = {Waste heat recovery plays an important role in energy source management. Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) can be used to recover low-temperature waste heat. In the present work a sample power plant waste heat was used to operate an ORC. First, two pure working fluids were selected based on their merits. Four possible thermodynamic models were considered in the analysis. They were defined based on where the condenser and evaporator temperatures are located. Four main thermal parameters, evaporator temperature, condenser temperature, degree of superheat and pinch point temperature difference were taken as key parameters. Levelized energy cost values and exergy efficiency were calculated as the optimization criteria. To optimize exergy and economic aspects of the system, Strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm II (SPEA II) was implemented. The Pareto frontier solutions were ordered and chose by TOPSIS. Model 3 outperformed all other models. After evaluating exergy efficiency by mixture mass fraction, R245fa [0.6]/Pentane [0.4] selected as the most efficient working fluid. Finally, every component’s role in determining the levelized energy cost and the exergy efficiency and were discussed. The turbine, condenser and evaporator were found as the costliest components.},

ABSTRACT = {The improvement of the overall performance of hydraulic pumps is the basis of intelligent hydraulics. Taking the straight line conjugate internal meshing gear pump as the research object, the theoretical flow rate and the geometric flow pulsation rate equations are established in this study through the volume change method. The change laws of the gear pair’s geometric parameters on the theoretical flow rate and the geometric flow pulsation rate are studied. The simulation model of the internal flow channel is established, and the influence factors and the influence degree of the flow pulsation and average flow rate are analyzed. The high-pressure positive displacement pump test system is also designed and built. The performance evaluations are conducted, and the experimental results are analyzed. The results show that the periodic change of the meshing point position is the root cause of the geometric flow pulsation. The theoretical flow rate and the geometric flow pulsation rate are 103.71 L/min and 1.76%, respectively. To increase the theoretical flow rate whilst decreasing the geometric flow pulsation rate, the tip circle radius of the external gear should be increased as much as possible within the allowable range of the design calculation. Amongst the three influencing factors that produce flow pulsation, the oil compressibility has no effect on the flow pulsation. The uneven internal leakage is the main factor, and the geometric flow pulsation only accounts for a small proportion. The internal leakage reduces the simulated flow rate by 3.59 L/min. The difference between the experimental and simulated flow rates is less than 2%. Within the allowable speed range, the rotation speed of the external gear should be increased as much as possible to increase the average flow rate and the volumetric efficiency.},

ABSTRACT = {A distributed variable model for solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC), with internal fuel reforming on the anode, has been developed in Aspen HYSYS. The proposed model accounts for the complex and interactive mechanisms involved in the SOFC operation through a mathematically viable and numerically fast modeling framework. The internal fuel reforming reaction calculations have been carried out in a plug flow reactor (PFR) module integrated with a spreadsheet module to interactively calculate the electrochemical process details. By interlinking the two modules within Aspen HYSYS flowsheeting environment, the highly nonlinear SOFC distributed profiles have been readily captured using empirical correlations and without the necessity of using an external coding platform, such as MATLAB or FORTRAN. Distributed variables including temperature, current density, and concentration profiles along the cell length, have been discussed for various reforming activity rates. Moreover, parametric estimation of anode oxidation risk and carbon formation potential against fuel reformation intensity have been demonstrated that contributes to the SOFC lifetime evaluation. Incrementally progressive catalyst activity has been proposed as a technically viable approach for attaining smooth profiles within the SOFC anode. The proposed modeling platform paves the way for SOFC system flowsheeting and optimization, particularly where the study of systems with stack distributed variables is of interest.},

ABSTRACT = {Metal aluminum has been widely used as an ingredient in propellant, gunpowder and thermite, but there is less understanding of the combustion mechanism of aluminum particles from submicron to several microns in diameter. This paper proposes to experimentally investigate the ignition and combustion characteristics of individual aluminum particles below 10 μm. A specific in situ diagnostic experimental apparatus was first designed for directly observing the ignition and combustion behaviors of individual aluminum particles, with a submicrometer spatial resolution and a temporal resolution of tens of microseconds. Direct observation through microscopic high-speed cinematography demonstrated that, when heated by a continuous laser, individual aluminum particles thermally expanded, followed by shell rupture; the molten aluminum core overflowed and evaporated, leading to ignition and combustion. Further results showed that, when the laser power densities were gradually increased (5.88, 7.56 and 8.81 × 105 W/cm2), the durations of thermal expansion, melting and evaporation were shortened. The required time for the aluminum particles to expand to 150% of their initial diameter was shortened (34 s, 0.34 s and 0.0125 s, respectively). This study will be beneficial to further extend the investigation of other individual metal particles and reveal their combustion mechanism by direct observation.},

ABSTRACT = {The Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) possesses a number of advantages over traditional power generation plants, including increased efficiency, flex-fuel, and carbon capture. A lesser-known advantage of the IGCC system is the ability to coordinate with the smart grid. The idea is that process modifications can enable dispatch capabilities in the sense of shifting power production away from periods of low electricity price to periods of high price and thus generate greater revenue. The work begins with a demonstration of Economic Model Predictive Control (EMPC) as a strategy to determine the dispatch policy by directly pursuing the objective of maximizing plant revenue. However, the numeric nature of EMPC creates an inherent limitation when it comes to process design. Thus, Economic Linear Optimal Control (ELOC) is proposed as a surrogate for EMPC in the formulation of the integrated design and control problem for IGCC power plants with smart grid coordination.},

ABSTRACT = {The integrated energy system is a vital part of distributed energy industries. In addition to this, the optimal economic dispatch model, which takes into account the complementary coordination of multienergy, is an important research topic. Considering the constraints of power balance, energy supply equipment, and energy storage equipment, a basic model of optimal economic dispatch of an integrated energy system is established. On this basis, a multiobjective function solving algorithm of NSGA-II, based on tent map chaos optimization, is proposed. The proposed model and algorithm are applied. The simulation results show that the optimal economic scheduling model of the integrated energy system established in this paper can provide a more economic system operation scheme and reduce the operation cost and risks associated with an integrated energy system. The Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II) multiobjective function solving algorithm, based on tent map chaos optimization, has better performance and efficiency.},

ABSTRACT = {With the increasing penetration of the hybrid AC/DC microgrid in power systems, an inertia decrease of the microgrid is caused. Many scholars have put forward the concept of a virtual synchronous generator, which enables the converters of the microgrid to possess the characteristics of a synchronous generator, thus providing inertia support for the microgrid. Nevertheless, the problems of active power oscillation and unbalance would be serious when multiple virtual synchronous generators (VSGs) operate in the microgrid. To conquer these problems, a VSG-based autonomous power-frequency control strategy is proposed, which not only independently allocates the power grid capacity according to the load capacity, but also effectively suppresses the active power oscillation. In addition, by establishing a dynamic small-signal model of the microgrid, the dynamic stability of the proposed control strategy in the microgrid is verified, and further reveals the leading role of the VSG and filter in the dynamic stability of microgrids. Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed control strategy are validated by the simulation results.},

ABSTRACT = {The cooling effect of room-temperature oxygen in oxygen blast furnaces with top gas recycling (TGR-OBF) delays the coal combustion process. To further explore the oxygen–coal combustion mechanism and intensify coal combustion in TGR-OBF, the effect of oxygen temperature on coal combustion was investigated using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). A three-dimensional model was developed to simulate the lance–blowpipe–tuyere–raceway of TGR-OBF. The effect of oxygen temperature at the same oxygen velocity and mass flow on coal combustion was investigated. Results showed the cooling effect of room-temperature oxygen was weakened, and the coal burnout was greatly increased with the increase in oxygen temperature. In particular, the coal burnout increased from 21.64% to 81.98% at the same oxygen velocity when the oxygen temperature increased from 300 to 500 K. The results provide useful reference for the development of TGR-OBF and coal combustion technology.},

ABSTRACT = {Water accumulation at the bottom of the product oil pipeline will lead to corrosion damage to the pipeline. The study on water carrying laws of refined oil could provide a reference for the safe operation of the pipeline. In this paper, the actual size of Lanzhou–Jiangyou section of Lanzhou–Chengdu–Chongqing pipeline was taken as the pipeline size. The volume of fluid (VOF) model of oil-water two-phase flow based on large eddy simulation (LES) was established. The numerical simulation of the water-carrying behavior of the product oil in the inclined pipeline was carried out. The LES-based two-phase flow model can capture the characteristics of stratified flow, wavy stratified flow, and dispersed flow under various operating conditions. The model was applied to simulate the water carrying process under various oil inlet velocities and the inclined pipe angles. The results show that as the pipeline inclined angle is 10~20° and the oil inlet velocity is 0.66 m/s, the flow patterns in the pipeline mainly include stratified flow and wavy stratified flow. As the oil inlet velocity is 0.88~1.55 m/s, the flow patterns in the pipe are mainly stratified flow, wavy stratified flow, and dispersed flow. As the inclined angle of the pipeline is 30~40°, the flow patterns in the pipeline mainly include stratified flows, wavy stratified flows, and dispersed flows. Finally, with the increase of flow time, water can be carried completely from the pipeline through the oil. With the increase of oil inlet velocity, the water carrying capacity of oil gradually increases. With the increase of pipeline inclination, the water carrying capacity of oil firstly increases and then decreases.},

The effect of nitrogen-containing gas flow rate on the nitridation of combustion products is shown. The effect of the amount of argon in the nitrogen–argon mixture on the burning rate and the burning temperature of the chromium powder is shown. It was found that an increase in the percentage of argon in the nitrogen–argon mixture can lead to the formation of an inverse combustion wave. The actual burning temperature is higher than adiabatic burning temperature in the co-flow filtration mode, thus the phenomenon of superadiabatic heating is observed. The phase composition of the obtained combustion products was studied. It was shown that the forced filtration mode allows for synthesizing non-stoichiometric Cr2N nitride.},

ABSTRACT = {Few experiments have been performed to investigate the hydraulic performance in a chevron brazed plate heat exchanger (BPHE) with the narrow channel at lower Reynolds number. The hydraulic characteristics of seven types of chevron BPHEs were investigated experimentally and numerical simulation revealed the effects of structural parameters on hydraulic performances. The correlations between friction factor f and Re were fitted out based on more than 500 sets of pressure drop data. The research results show that there is a power-law between f and Re; which has a similar trend but a different amplitude for different plates, and the exponent of the power-law could be approximate to a constant. Numerical results show that the pressure drop Δp is positively correlated with the corrugated angle and spacing, however, negatively correlated with the corrugated height. Research on the hydraulic performance is significant for the optimal design of BPHE.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper proposes an efficient power management approach for the 24 h-ahead optimal maneuver of Mega–scale grid–connected microgrids containing a huge penetration of wind power, dispatchable distributed generation (diesel generator), energy storage system and local loads. The proposed energy management optimization objective aims to minimize the microgrid expenditure for fuel, operation and maintenance and main grid power import. It also aims to maximize the microgrid revenue by exporting energy to the upstream utility grid. The optimization model considers the uncertainties of the wind energy and power consumptions in the microgrids, and appropriate forecasting techniques are implemented to handle the uncertainties. The optimization model is formulated for a day-ahead optimization timeline with one-hour time steps, and it is solved using the ant colony optimization (ACO)-based metaheuristic approach. Actual data and parameters obtained from a practical microgrid platform in Atlanta, GA, USA are employed to formulate and validate the proposed energy management approach. Several simulations considering various operational scenarios are achieved to reveal the efficacy of the devised methodology. The obtained findings show the efficacy of the devised approach in various operational cases of the microgrids. To further confirm the efficacy of the devised approach, the achieved findings are compared to a pattern search (PS) optimization-based energy management approach and demonstrate outperformed performances with respect to solution optimality and computing time.},

ABSTRACT = {The fault detection method has been used usually to give a diagnosis of the performance and efficiency in the proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) systems. To be able to use this method a lot of sensors are implemented in the PEMFC to measure different parameters like pressure, temperature, voltage, and electrical current. However, despite the high reliability of the sensors, they can fail or give erroneous measurements. To address this problem, an efficient solution to replace the sensors must be found. For this reason, in this work, the immersion and invariance method is proposed to develop an oxygen pressure estimator based on the voltage, electrical current density, and temperature measurements. The estimator stability region is calculated by applying Lyapunov’s Theorem and constraints to achieve stability are established for the oxygen pressure, electrical current density, and temperature. Under these estimator requirements, oxygen pressure measurements of high reliability are obtained to fault diagnosis without the need to use an oxygen sensor.},

ABSTRACT = {As the most mature denitration technology in the cement clinker burning process, selective non-catalytic reduction (SNCR) has been unable to meet the requirements of ultra-low nitrogen oxide (NOX) emissions under low ammonia escape, thus a hybrid denitration process based on SNCR was established. The process had three steps: reducing the NOX background concentration (NBC), implementing staged combustion, and optimizing the effect of the SNCR. One of the keys to this process was the real-time acquisition of the NBC. In this paper, a multivariate linear regression model for the prediction of NBC was constructed and applied to one 12,000 t/d production line and one 5000 t/d production line. For the 12,000 t/d production line, NBC had a positive correlation with the temperature of the calciner outlet, the pressure, and the temperature of the kiln hood, and it had a negative correlation with the quantity of the kiln coal, the temperature of the smoke chamber, and the main motor current of the kiln. The influence degree of each parameter on the NBC is gradually weakened according to the above order. The determination coefficient (R2) of the model was 0.771, and the mean absolute error and maximum relative error between the predicted and measured NBC were 6.300 mg/m3 and 18.670 mg/m3 respectively.},

ABSTRACT = {The combustion emissions of the hydrogen-fueled engines are very clean, but the problems of abnormal combustion and high NOx emissions limit their applications. Nowadays hydrogen engines use exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) technology to control the intensity of premixed combustion and reduce the NOx emissions. This study aims at improving the abnormal combustion and decreasing the NOx emissions of the hydrogen engine by applying a three-dimensional (3D) computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model of a single-cylinder hydrogen-fueled engine equipped with an EGR system. The results indicated that peak in-cylinder pressure continuously increased with the increase of the ignition advance angle and was closer to the top dead center (TDC). In addition, the mixture was burned violently near the theoretical air–fuel ratio, and the combustion duration was shortened. Moreover, the NOx emissions, the average pressure, and the in-cylinder temperature decreased as the EGR ratio increased. Furthermore, increasing the EGR ratio led to an increase in the combustion duration and a decrease in the peak heat release rate. EGR system could delay the spontaneous combustion reaction of the end-gas and reduce the probability of knocking. The pressure rise rate was controlled and the in-cylinder hot spots were reduced by the EGR system, which could suppress the occurrence of the pre-ignition in the hydrogen engine.},

ABSTRACT = {This study investigates the effects of convective hydrothermal pretreatment (CHTP) compared to microwave pretreatment (MWP) on the anaerobic digestion of hybrid Napier grass for biomethane production. For rapid estimation of methane yield (YCH4), enzymatic hydrolyzability (EH), whose test lasts only 2 days was used as a surrogate parameter instead of the biochemical methane potential (BMP) assay that normally takes 45–60 days. The relationship between EH and BMP was successfully modeled with satisfactory accuracy (R2 = 0.9810). From CHTP results, quadratic regression characterised by p < 0.0001 and R2 = 0.8364 shows that YCH4 increase was clearly sensitive to detention time at all CHTP temperatures. The maximal YCH4 achieved of 301.5 ± 3.0 mL CH4/gVSadd was 53.2% higher than the control. Then, MWP was employed at various power levels and microwave exposure times. Changes in lignocellulosic structure by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and energy balance demonstrate that MWP caused more damage to plant cells, which proved more effective than CHTP. In the best conditions, approximately 50% of energy was needed for MWP to achieve the equivalent improvement in YCH4. However, CHTP is a more suitable option since waste heat, i.e., from a biogas CHP (combined heat and power) unit, could be used, as opposed to the electricity required for MWP.},

ABSTRACT = {The photovoltaic (PV) industry is an important part of the renewable energy industry. With the growing use of PV systems, interest in their operation and maintenance (O&M) is increasing. In this regard, analyses of power generation efficiency and inverter efficiency are very important. The first step in efficiency analysis is solar power estimation based on environment sensor data. In this study, solar power was estimated using a univariate linear regression model. The estimated solar power data were cross-validated with the actual solar power data obtained from the inverter. The results provide information on the power generation efficiency of the inverter. The linear estimation model developed in this study was validated using a single PV system. It is possible to apply the coefficients presented in this study to other PV systems, even though the nature and error rates of the collected data may vary depending on the inverter manufacturer. To apply the proposed model to PV systems with different power generation capacities, reconstructing the model according to the power generation capacity is necessary.},

ABSTRACT = {Safety is the premise of efficiency and effectiveness in the port operation. Safety investment is becoming a vital part of port operation in current era in order to overcome different types of hazards the port operation exposed to. This paper aims to improve the safety level of port operation through analyzing its influencing factors and exploring the interactions between the safety investment and system risk level. By analyzing the key factors affecting the port operation and their mutual relationship within a man–machine–environment–management system, a decision-making model of safety investment in port enterprise was established by system dynamics (SD). An illustration example and a sensitivity analysis were carried out to justify and validate the proposed model. The results show that increasing the total safety investment of port enterprises, improving the safety management investment on personnel, and strengthening the implementation effect of investment can improve the degree of port security to a certain extent. The strength of the proposed work is its practical application in current scenarios using real time data and the ability to provide a baseline approach for port enterprises to formulate safety investment strategy.},

ABSTRACT = {The origins and effects of the complex vortex structure near the volute outlet of a multi-blade centrifugal fan are investigated in this paper. Due to the wide blade and short blade channel, the airflow maintains a large radial velocity during the blade channel. This continuous radial partial velocity causes vortices to be generated at the region of volute outlet. Then, the secondary flow close to the impeller generate from the center to the sides in volute. It is obtained that the streamlines are divided into two parts (backflow and outflow) at volute outlet. Although the vortices near volute outlet region are complex, the main features of flow behavior caused by the vortex are understandable.},

ABSTRACT = {The present work aims to provide insights into the dynamic operation of a coupled reformer/combustion unit that can utilize a variety of saturated hydrocarbons (HCs) with 1–4 C atoms towards H2 production (along with CO2). Within this concept, a preselected HC-based feedstock enters a steam reforming reactor for the production of H2 via a series of catalytic reactions, whereas a sequential postprocessing unit (water gas shift reactor) is then utilized to increase H2 purity and minimize CO. The core unit of the overall system is the combustor that is coupled with the reformer reactor and continuously provides heat (a) for sustaining the prevailing endothermic reforming reactions and (b) for the process feed streams. The dynamic model as it is initially developed, consists of ordinary differential equations that capture the main physicochemical phenomena taking place at each subsystem (energy and mass balances) and is compared against available thermodynamic data (temperature and concentration). Further on, a distributed control scheme based on PID (Proportional–Integral–Derivative) controllers (each one tuned via Ziegler–Nichols/Z-N methodology) is applied and a set of case studies is formulated. The aim of the control scheme is to maintain the selected process-controlled variables within their predefined set-points, despite the emergence of sudden disturbances. It was revealed that the accurately tuned controllers lead to (a) a quick start-up operation, (b) minimum overshoot (especially regarding the sensitive reactor temperature), (c) zero offset from the desired operating set-points, and (d) quick settling during disturbance emergence.},

ABSTRACT = {Lead-acid battery (LAB) weight is a major downside stopping it from being adapted to electric/hybrid vehicles. Lead grids constitute up to 50% of LAB electrode’s weight and it only ensures electric connection to electrochemically active material and provides structural integrity. Using graphite felt (GF) as a current collector can reduce the electrode’s weight while increasing the surface area. Modification of GF with lead (II) oxide using impregnation and calcination techniques and lead (II) formate and acetate as precursors was conducted to produce composite electrodes. It was found that lead (II) formate is not a viable material for this purpose, whereas multiple impregnation in lead (II) acetate saturated solution and calcination in air leads to thermal destruction GF. However, impregnation and calcination under nitrogen atmosphere in three cycles produced a sample of good quality with a mass loading of lead (II) oxide that was 17.18 g g−1 GF. This equates to only 5.5% of the total mass of composite electrode to be GF, which is immensely lower than lead grid mass in traditional electrodes. This result shows that a possible lightweight alternative of LAB electrode can be produced using the proposed modification method.},

ABSTRACT = {In this research, we performed energy and exergy assessments of a solar driven power plant. Supercritical carbon dioxide (S-CO2) Brayton cycle is used for the conversion of heat to work. The plant runs on solar energy from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. and to account for the fluctuations in the solar energy, the plant is equipped with an auxiliary heater operating on hot combustion gases from the combustion chamber. The capital city of Saudi Arabia (Riyadh) is chosen in this study and the solar insolation levels for this location are calculated using the ASHRAE clear-sky model. The solar collector (central receiver) receives solar energy reflected by the heliostats; therefore, a radially staggered heliostat field is generated for this purpose. A suite of code is developed to calculate various parameters of the heliostat field, such as optical efficiencies, intercept factors, attenuation factors and heliostat characteristic angles. S-CO2 Brayton cycle is simulated in commercial software, Aspen HYSYS V9 (Aspen Technology, Inc., Bedford, MA, USA). The cycle is mainly powered by solar energy but assisted by an auxiliary heater to maintain a constant net power input of 80 MW to the cycle. The heliostat field generated, composed of 1207 rows, provides 475 watts per unit heliostat’s area to the central receiver. Heat losses from the central receiver due to natural convection and radiation are significant, with an average annual loss of 10 percent in the heat absorbed by the receiver. Heat collection rate at the central receiver reveals that the maximum support of auxiliary heat is needed in December, at nearly 13% of the net input energy. Exergy analysis shows that the highest exergy loss takes place in the heliostat field that is nearly 42.5% of incident solar exergy.},

ABSTRACT = {The accuracy and reliability of solar tracking greatly impacts the performance of concentrator photovoltaic modules (CPV). Thus, it is of utmost significance to know how deviations in tracking influence CPV module power. In this work, the positioning characteristics of CPV modules compared to the focus points were investigated. The performance of CPV modules mounted on a dual-axis tracking system was analysed as a function of their orientation and inclination. The actual experiment was carried out with CPV cells of 3 mm in diameter. By using a dual tracking system under real weather conditions, the module’s position was gradually modified until the inclination differed by 5° relative to the optimal position of the focus point of the CPV module. The difference in inclination was established by the perfect perpendicularity to the Sun’s rays. The results obtained specifically for CPV technology help determine the level of accuracy that solar tracking photovoltaic systems are required to have to keep the loss in power yield under a certain level. Moreover, this power yield loss also demonstrated that the performance insensitivity thresholds of the CPV modules did not depend on the directions of the alterations in azimuthal alignment. The novelty of the research lies in the fact that earlier, no information had been found regarding the tracking insensitivity point in CPV technologies. A further analysis was carried out to compare the yield of CPV to other, conventional photovoltaic technologies under real Central European climate conditions. It was shown that CPV needs a sun tracking accuracy of at least 0.5° in order to surpass the yield of other PV technologies. Besides providing an insight into the tracking error values of solar tracking sensors, it is believed that the results might facilitate the planning of solar tracking sensor investments as well as the economic calculations related to 3 mm cell diameter CPV system investments.},

ABSTRACT = {Based on the shear stress transport (SST) turbulence model, the influence of different outlet pipe angles on the head and efficiency of a boiler circulating pump was analyzed. When the outlet pipe angle changed from 115° to 130°, the head and efficiency of the pump reduced significantly. The boiler circulating pump with 115° outlet pipe angle was selected as the further research object, and the reliability of the numerical simulation was verified by experiments. The transient flow of the prototype pump under the design flow rate condition (1.0Qd) and four other flow rate conditions (0.6Qd, 0.8Qd, 1.2Qd, and 1.4Qd) was studied. The results show that, under the conditions of design flow and large flow rate (1.0Qd, 1.2Qd, and 1.4Qd), the centrality and regularity of radial force distribution are obviously better than those of small flow rate (0.6Qd, 0.8Qd). The leakage of the rear seal ring is less than that of the front seal ring under five flow rate conditions. As the flow rate increases, the leakage of front and rear seal rings decreases, and the leakage ratio of front and rear seal rings increases. The energy loss of the rear cover plate is greater than the energy loss of the front cover plate under five flow rate conditions. With the increase in flow rate, the total loss energy of the prototype pump decreases first and then increases, and the energy loss of the disc becomes larger and larger.},

ABSTRACT = {One of the most important problems of operating solar heating systems involves variable efficiency depending on operating conditions. This problem is more pronounced in hybrid energy systems, where a solar installation cooperates with other segments based on conventional carriers of energy or renewable sources of energy. The operating cost of each segment of a hybrid system depends mainly on the resulting efficiency of solar installation. For over 40 years, the procedures of testing solar collectors have been undergoing development, testing, comparison and verification in order to create a procedure that would allow determining the thermal behavior of a solar collector without performing expensive and complicated experimental tests, usually based on the steady state condition. The proper determination of the static and dynamic properties of a solar collector is of key significance, as they constitute a basis for the design of a solar heating installation, as well as a control system. It is therefore important to conduct simulating and operating tests enabling the performance of a comparative analysis intended to indicate the degree to which the static and dynamic properties of a solar collector depend on the method used for their determination. The paper compares the static and dynamic properties of a flat solar collector determined by means of various methods. Based on the produced results, it has been concluded that the static and dynamic properties of a collector determined using various methods may differ from each other even by 50%. This means that it is possible to increase the efficiency of a solar heating installation via the use of an adaptive control algorithm, enabling real-time calculation of the values of characteristic parameters of solar installation, e.g., the time constant under operating conditions.},

Both axial and lateral stress–strain deformation curves clearly show the non-linear ferroelastic behavior of LSCF perovskite during compression. The ferroelastic characteristics of deformation curves such as coercive stress and apparent loading moduli decrease when the porosity of the samples increases. Ferroelastic creep deformations at applied stresses of 25 and 50 MPa demonstrate that stress and porosity are influencing factors on creep deformation, which increases with increasing stress and porosity. A negative creep or axial expansion and lateral contraction were observed in the sample with 35% porosity under 50-MPa constant compression stress.},

ABSTRACT = {In the pursuit of mitigating the effects of climate change the European Union and the government of Finland have set targets for emission reductions for the near future. This study examined the carbon emission reduction potential in the Finnish energy system with power-to-heat (P2H) coupling of the electricity and heat sectors with different housing renovation levels. The measures conducted in the energy system were conducted as follows. Wind power generation was increased in the Finnish power system with 10 increments. For each of these, the operation of hydropower was optimized to maximize the utilization of new wind generation. The excess wind generation was used to replace electricity and heat from combined heat and power production for district heating. The P2H conversion was performed by either 2000 m deep borehole heat exchangers coupled to heat pumps, with possible priming of heat, or with electrode boilers. The housing stock renovated to different levels affected both the electricity and district heating demands. The carbon emission reduction potential of the building renovation measures, and the energy system measures were determined over 25 years. Together with the required investment costs for the different measures, unit costs of emission reductions, €/t-CO2, were determined. The lowest unit cost solution of different measures was established, for which the unit cost of emission reductions was 241 €/t-CO2 and the reduced carbon emissions 11.3 Mt-CO2 annually. Moreover, the energy system measures were found to be less expensive compared to the building renovation measures, in terms of unit costs, and the P2H coupling a cost-efficient manner to increase the emission reductions.},

ABSTRACT = {Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) can be fueled with various gases, including carbon-containing compounds. High operating temperatures, exceeding 600 °C, and the presence of a porous, nickel-based SOFC anode, might lead to the formation of solid carbon particles from fuels such as carbon monoxide and other gases with hydrocarbon-based compounds. Carbon deposition on fuel electrode surfaces can cause irreversible damage to the cell, eventually destroying the electrode. Soot formation mechanisms are strictly related to electrochemical, kinetic, and thermodynamic conditions. In the current study, the effects of carbon deposition on the lifetime and performance of SOFCs were analyzed in-operando, both in single-cell and stack conditions. It was observed that anodic gas velocity has an impact on soot formation and deposition, thus it was also studied in depth. Single-anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells were fueled with gases delivered in such a way that the initial velocities in the anodic compartment ranged from 0.1 to 0.7 m/s. Both cell operation and post-mortem observations proved that the carbon deposition process accelerates at higher anodic gas velocity. Furthermore, single-cell results were verified in an SOFC stack operated in carbon-deposition regime by dry-coupling with a downdraft 150 kWth biomass gasifier.},

ABSTRACT = {Gaining energy independence by utilizing new and renewable energy resources has become imperative for Korea. Energy recovery from Korean municipal solid waste (MSW) could be a promising option to resolve the issue, as Korean MSW is highly recyclable due to its systematic separation, collection and volume-based waste disposal system. In this study, gasification experiments were conducted on Korean municipal waste-derived solid fuel (SRF) using a fixed bed reactor by varying the equivalence ratio (ER) to assess the viability of syngas production. Experiments were also conducted on coal and biomass under similar conditions to compare the experimental results, as the gasification applicability of coal and biomass are long-established. Experimental results showed that Korean SRF could be used to recover energy in form of syngas. In particular, 50.94% cold gas efficiency and 54.66% carbon conversion ratio with a lower heating value of 12.57 MJ/Nm3 can be achieved by gasifying the SRF at 0.4 ER and 900 °C. However, compared to coal and biomass, the syngas efficiency of Korean SRF was less, which can be resolved by operating the gasification processes at high temperatures. If proper research and development activities are conducted on Korean SRF, it could be a good substitute for fossil fuels in the future.},

ABSTRACT = {Hybrid Renewable Energy Systems (HRESs) have been touted as an appropriate way for supplying electricity to remote and off-grid areas in developing countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), where rural electrification challenges are the most pronounced. This study proposes a two-step methodology for optimizing and analyzing a stand-alone photovoltaic/wind/battery/diesel hybrid system to meet the electricity needs of Fanisua, an off-grid and remote village of northern Nigeria. In the first step, the MATLAB environment was used to run simulations and optimize the system via the genetic algorithm. Then, techno-economic and emissions analysis was carried out in the second step to compare the proposed system to the existing traditional modes of rural electrification in sub-Saharan Africa, namely, the grid-extension and diesel generator. The break-even distance parameter was adopted in the comparison with grid-extension. Besides, the hypothetical project of replacing the diesel generator by the optimal system was analyzed using the Simple Payback Period (SPP) and Net Present Value (NPV) parameters. The resulting optimal design architecture included an 89.271-kW photovoltaic array, a 100.31-W diesel generator, and 148 batteries with a total annualized cost (TAC) and cost of energy (COE) of USD 43,807 and USD 0.25/kWh, respectively. The break-even distance found was 16.2 km, while the NPV and SPP of the hypothetical project were USD 572,382 and 2.8 years, respectively. The savings in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions of the proposed system compared to the grid extension and the diesel generator were found to be 85,401.08 kg/year and 122,062.85 kg/year, respectively. This study highlighted the role that solar PV-based HRESs could play in the sustainable electricity supply in rural areas of sub-Saharan Africa.},

ABSTRACT = {Non-intrusive load monitoring is a vital part of an overall load management scheme. One major disadvantage of existing non-intrusive load monitoring methods is the difficulty to accurately identify loads with similar electrical characteristics. To overcome the various switching probability of loads with similar characteristics in a specific time period, a new non-intrusive load monitoring method is proposed in this paper which will modify monitoring results based on load switching probability distribution curve. Firstly, according to the addition theorem of load working currents, the complex current is decomposed into the independently working current of each load. Secondly, based on the load working current, the initial identification of load is achieved with current frequency domain components, and then the load switching times in each hour is counted due to the initial identified results. Thirdly, a back propagation (BP) neural network is trained by the counted results, the switching probability distribution curve of an identified load is fitted with the BP neural network. Finally, the load operation pattern is profiled according to the switching probability distribution curve, the load operation pattern is used to modify identification result. The effectiveness of the method is verified by the measured data. This approach combines the operation pattern of load to modify the identification results, which improves the ability to identify loads with similar electrical characteristics.},

ABSTRACT = {Chemical industries rely heavily on fossil resources for the production of carbon-based chemicals. A possible transformation towards sustainability is the usage of carbon dioxide as a source of carbon. Carbon dioxide is activated for follow-up reactions by its conversion to carbon monoxide. This can be accomplished by electrochemical reduction in solid oxide cells. In this work, we investigate the process performance of the direct high-temperature CO2 electrolysis by current-voltage characteristics (iV) and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) experiments. Variations of the operation parameters temperature, load, fuel utilization, feed gas ratio and flow rate show the versatility of the procedure with maintaining high current densities of 0.75 up to 1.5 A·cm−2, therefore resulting in high conversion rates. The potential of the high-temperature carbon dioxide electrolysis as a suitable enabler for the activation of CO2 as a chemical feedstock is therefore appointed and shown.},

ABSTRACT = {The global demand for clean fuels is increasing in order to meet the requirements of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) of 0.5% global Sulphur cap and Tier III emission limits. Natural gas has begun to be popularized on liquefied natural gas (LNG) ships because of its low cost and environment friendly. In large-bore marine engines, ignition with pilot fuel in the prechamber is a good way to reduce combustion variability and extend the lean-burn limit. However, the occurrence of knock limits the increase in power. Therefore, this paper investigates the effect of pilot fuel injection conditions on performance and knocking of a marine 2-stroke low-pressure dual-fuel (LP-DF) engine. The engine simulations were performed under different pilot fuel parameters. The results showed that the average in-cylinder temperature, the average in-cylinder pressure, and the NOx emissions gradually decreased with the delay of the pilot injection timing. Furthermore, the combustion situation gradually deteriorated as the pilot injection duration increased. A shorter pilot injection duration was beneficial to reduce NOx pollutant emissions. Moreover, the number of pilot injector orifices affected the ignition of pilot fuel and the flame propagation speed inside the combustion chamber.},

ABSTRACT = {Solid-state recycling is a sustainable technique for recycling aluminium scrap, and the process before recycling is essential to control the physical properties of the product. In this work, the effect of the thermally-treated chips on the extrudate density was investigated. The aluminium chips were thermally-treated to enrich the alumina layer and reduce compaction pressure during chips compaction before recycled using direct hot extrusion. The chips that were transformed into compacted billets were extruded directly without melting and conducted according to 24 full factorial experimental design. The density test on the recycle extrudate found that the density variation ranged from 2724 to 2983 kg/m3. The ANOVA result showed that all factors investigated were statistically significant. The most significant factor was the preheating temperature, followed by extrusion ratio, chip treatment temperature, chip treatment time, and the interaction of chip treatment-time–extrusion ratio. The predictive model suggested by the ANOVA is useful to predict the density with 1% error. Microstructure examination revealed the presence of alumina entrapped in the recycle extrudate, in which thermal-treated chips contained more alumina than that of the untreated chips. The result indicated that the thermal treatment performed on the chips had enriched the in-situ alumina, affecting the density of the recycle extrudate.},

ABSTRACT = {In the rural zones of Latin American and Caribbean developing countries, the poorest households rely on traditional fuels such as firewood to meet their daily cooking needs. Many of those countries are located near the equator, where they have a tropical climate and grass is one of the most common biomass crops. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of harvesting age (30, 44, and 57 days) in the performance of anaerobic digestion of King Grass (Pennisetum purpureum cv. King Grass) grown under tropical climate conditions. Three reduction methods of crop size were also compared. Results showed that 44-day harvesting age presented the greater specific methane yield (347.8 mLCH4 g−1VS) and area-specific methane yield (9773 m3CH4 ha−1 y−1). The machine chopped method (1–3 cm for stems and 1–10 cm for leaves) was the reduction method that maximized the methane production. From those results, the calculated area required for grass cultivation to provide the cooking energy to a typical family in the Colombian rural zones is 154 m2.},

ABSTRACT = {Solar photovoltaic (PV) direct current (DC) microgrids have gained significant popularity during the last decade for low cost and sustainable rural electrification. Various system architectures have been practically deployed, however, their assessment concerning system sizing, losses, and operational efficiency is not readily available in the literature. Therefore, in this research work, a mathematical framework for the comparative analysis of various architectures of solar photovoltaic-based DC microgrids for rural applications is presented. The compared architectures mainly include (a) central generation and central storage architecture, (b) central generation and distributed storage architecture, (c) distributed generation and central storage architecture, and (d) distributed generation and distributed storage architecture. Each architecture is evaluated for losses, including distribution losses and power electronic conversion losses, for typical power delivery from source end to the load end in the custom village settings. Newton–Raphson method modified for DC power flow was used for distribution loss analysis, while power electronic converter loss modeling along with the Matlab curve-fitting tool was used for the evaluation of power electronic losses. Based upon the loss analysis, a framework for DC microgrid components (PV and battery) sizing was presented and also applied to the various architectures under consideration. The case study results show that distributed generation and distributed storage architecture with typical usage diversity of 40% is the most feasible architecture from both system sizing and operational cost perspectives and is 13% more efficient from central generation and central storage architecture for a typical village of 40 houses. The presented framework and the analysis results will be useful in selecting an optimal DC microgrid architecture for future rural electrification implementations.},

ABSTRACT = {The limited shelf life of carbon prepreg waste (CPW) from component manufacturing restricts its use as a composite reinforcement fibre on its own. However, CPW can be recycled with glass fibre (GF) reinforcement to develop a unique remediate material. Therefore, this study fabricated (1) a glass fibre-carbon prepreg waste reinforced polymer hybrid composite (GF-CPW-PP), (2) a polypropylene composite (PP), (3) a carbon prepreg waste reinforced composite (CPW-PP), and (4) a glass fibre reinforced composite (GF-PP) and reported their degradation and residual tension properties after immersion in water. The polymer hybrid composites were fabricated via extrusion technique with minimum reinforce glass-carbon prepreg waste content of 10 wt%. The immersion test was conducted at room temperature using distilled water. Moisture content and diffusion coefficient (DC) were determined based on water adsorption values recorded at 24-h intervals over a one-week period. The results indicated that GF-PP reinforced composites retained the most moisture post-168 h of immersion. However, hardness and tensile strength were found to decrease with increased water adsorption. Tensile strength was found to be compromised since pores produced during hydrolysis reduced interfacial bonding between glass fibre and prepreg carbon reinforcements and the PP matrix.},

ABSTRACT = {This numerical investigation intends to present the impact of nanoparticles volume fraction, Casson, and magnetic force on natural convection in the boundary layer region of a horizontal cylinder in a Casson nanofluid under constant heat flux boundary conditions. Methanol is considered as a host Casson fluid. Graphite oxide (GO), single and multiple walls carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs and MWCNTs) nanoparticles have been incorporated to support the heat transfer performances of the host fluid. The Keller box technique is employed to solve the transformed governing equations. Our numerical findings were in an excellent agreement with the preceding literature. Graphical results of the effect of the relevant parameters on some physical quantities related to examine the behavior of Casson nanofluid flow were obtained, and they confirmed that an augmentation in Casson parameter results in a decline in local skin friction, velocity, or temperature, as well as leading to an increment in local Nusselt number. Furthermore, MWCNTs are the most efficient in improving the rate of heat transfer and velocity, and they possess the lowest temperature.},

ABSTRACT = {Transitioning to a renewable energy economy requires the widespread integration of solar and wind power, which are intermittent, into the electricity grid. To this goal, it is paramount to develop cost-competitive, reliable, location-independence, and large-scale energy storage technologies. The hydrogen bromine flow battery (HBFB) is a promising technology given the abundant material availability and its high power density. Here, the aim is to perform a comprehensive techno-economic analysis of a 500 kW nominal power/5 MWh HBFB storage system, based on the levelized cost of storage approach. Then, we systematically analyze stack and system components costs for both the current base and a future scenario (2030). We find that, for the base case, HBFB capital investments are competitive to Li-ion battery technology, highlighting the potential of large-scale HBFB market introduction. Improving the stack performance and reducing the stack and system costs are expected to result in ~62% reduction potential in capital investments. The base-case levelized cost of storage, $0.074/kWh, is sufficiently low for a wind-solar storage system to compete with a fossil-based power plant, with potential for reduction to $0.034/kWh in the future scenario. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the levelized cost of storage is most sensitive towards the stack lifetime, which motivates research efforts into advanced electrocatalysts with higher durability and ion-exchange membranes with improved selectivity.},

ABSTRACT = {Sustainable Development Goals establish the main challenges humankind is called to tackle to assure equal comfort of living worldwide. Among these, the access to affordable renewable energy and clean water are overriding, especially in the context of developing economies. Reversible Solid Oxide Cells (rSOC) are a pivotal technology for their sector-coupling potential. This paper aims at studying the implementation of such a technology in new concept PV-hybrid energy storage mini-grids with close access to seawater. In such assets, rSOCs have a double useful effect: charge/discharge of the bulk energy storage combined with seawater desalination. Based on the outcomes of an experimental proof-of-concept on a single cell operated with salty water, the operation of the novel mini-grid is simulated throughout a solar year. Simulation results identify the fittest mini-grid configuration in order to achieve energy and environmental optimization, hence scoring a renewable penetration of more than 95%, marginal CO2 emissions (13 g/kWh), and almost complete coverage of load demand. Sector-coupling co-production rate (desalinated water versus electricity issued from the rSOC) is 0.29 L/kWh.},

ABSTRACT = {One popular method for optimizing systems, referred to as ANN-PSO, uses an artificial neural network (ANN) to approximate the system and an optimization method like particle swarm optimization (PSO) to select inputs. However, with reinforcement learning developments, it is important to compare ANN-PSO to newer algorithms, like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). To investigate ANN-PSO’s and PPO’s performance and applicability, we compare their methodologies, apply them on steady-state economic optimization of a chemical process, and compare their results to a conventional first principles modeling with nonlinear programming (FP-NLP). Our results show that ANN-PSO and PPO achieve profits nearly as high as FP-NLP, but PPO achieves slightly higher profits compared to ANN-PSO. We also find PPO has the fastest computational times, 10 and 10,000 times faster than FP-NLP and ANN-PSO, respectively. However, PPO requires more training data than ANN-PSO to converge to an optimal policy. This case study suggests PPO has better performance as it achieves higher profits and faster online computational times. ANN-PSO shows better applicability with its capability to train on historical operational data and higher training efficiency.},

ABSTRACT = {Microscale combustion has potential application in a micro power generator. This paper studied the ignition and combustion behavior of individual graphite microparticles in a micro-combustor to explore the utilization of carbon-based fuels at the microscale system. The individual graphite microparticles inside the micro-combustor were ignited by a highly focused laser in an air flow with natural convection at atmospheric temperature and pressure. The results show that the ignition of graphite microparticles was heterogeneous. The particle diameter had a small weak effect on ignition delay time and threshold ignition energy. The micro-combustor wall heat losses had significant effects on the ignition and combustion. During combustion, flame instability, photophoresis, repetitive extinction and reignition were identified. The flame structure was asymmetric, and the fluctuation of flame front and radiation intensity showed combustion instability. Photophoretic force pushed the graphite away from the focal point and resulted in extinction. Owing to large wall heat loss, the flame quickly extinguished. However, the graphite was inductively reignited by laser.},

ABSTRACT = {Ash behavior is a key operational aspect of industrial-scale power generation by means of biomass combustion. In this work, FactSageTM 6.4 software was used to develop and assess three models of wheat straw combustion in a vibrating grate-fired commercial boiler of 16 MWth, aiming to describe the inorganic elements release as well as fly ash melting behavior and composition. Simulations were carried out solving four consecutive calculation stages corresponding to the main plant sections. Chemical fractionation was adopted in order to distinguish between reactive, inert and partially reactive biomass fractions. The developed models allow take into account different levels of partial reactivity, values of the temperature for each sub-stage on the grate, and ways to apply entrained streams based on data from the elemental analyses of the fly ashes. To this end, two one-week experimental campaigns were conducted in the plant to carry out the sampling. It has been found that considering chemical fractionation is indispensable to describe the entrainment of solid particles in the gas stream. In addition, the best results are obtained by adopting a small reactivity (2%) of the inert fraction. As for fly ash composition, the concentrations of the major elements showed good agreement with the results from the chemical analyses. In the case of S and Cl, calculations revealed a match with gas cooling effects in the superheaters as well as an entrainment effect. The melting behavior together with the presence of KCl and K2SO4 condensates, point out at possible corrosion phenomena in walls at temperatures of 700–750 °C.},

ABSTRACT = {To study the flow characteristics and the wear distribution of pumps at different rotation speeds, a rotating disc with three blades was designed for experiments. Numerical simulations were conducted using a computational fluid dynamics-discrete phase model (CFD–DPM) approach. The experimental and numerical results were compared, and the flow characteristics and wear behaviors were determined. As the speed increased, the particles at the blade working surface aggregated. The particle velocity gradually increased at the outlet of the channel. The severe wear areas were all located in the outlet area of the blade working surface, and the wear area extended toward the inlet area of the blade with increasing speed. The wear rate of the blade surface increased as the speed increased, and an area with a steady wear rate appeared at the outlet area of the blade. When the concentration was more than 8%, the severe wear areas were unchanged at the same speed. When the speed increased, the severe wear areas of the blade produced wear ripples, and the area of the ripples increased with increasing speed. The height difference between the ripples along the flow direction on the blade became larger as the speed increased.},

Optimized NARX model architectures of 5-29-1, 5-19-1, 5-17-1, 5-13-1 representing the input nodes, hidden neurons and the output units were obtained from the series of models configured.

Coal consumption has the highest level of influence on CO2 emissions in the four ASEAN countries based on the sensitivity analysis. These findings suggest that government policies in the four ASEAN countries should be more intensified on strategies to reduce CO2 emissions in relationship with the energy and economic indicators.},

ABSTRACT = {Inter-plant hydrogen integration can reduce the consumption of hydrogen utility in petrochemical parks. However, the fluctuation of operating conditions will lead to complex multi-period problems of hydrogen network integration. This work develops a simultaneous optimization approach to solving multi-period optimization problems for the inter-plant hydrogen network. To do this, we consider the inter-plant hydrogen integration and the fluctuation of operating conditions in each plant at the same time, and aim to minimize the total annualized cost of the entire hydrogen system of all plants involved. An industrial case study of a three-plant hydrogen network with seven subperiods was adopted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Results show that the optimal structure and the corresponding scheduling scheme can be obtained when the lowest cost of the system is targeted. Compared with the stepwise methods, the proposed approach features taking the characteristics of all subperiods into account simultaneously and making the structure of the hydrogen network much more effective and economical. For the scheduling schemes, the utilization efficiency of the internal hydrogen sources is increased by hydrogen exchange among the plants.},

ABSTRACT = {The hybrid renewable energy system is a promising and significant technology for clean and sustainable island power supply. Among the abundant ocean energy sources, tidal current energy appears to be very valuable due to its excellent predictability and stability, particularly compared with the intermittent wind and solar energy. In this paper, an island hybrid energy microgrid composed of photovoltaic, wind, tidal current, battery and diesel is constructed according to the actual energy sources. A sizing optimization method based on improved multi-objective grey wolf optimizer (IMOGWO) is presented to optimize the hybrid energy system. The proposed method is applied to determine the optimal system size, which is a multi-objective problem including the minimization of annualized cost of system (CACS) and deficiency of power supply probability (DPSP). MATLAB software is utilized to program and simulate the hybrid energy system. Optimization results confirm that IMOGWO is feasible to optimally size the system, and the energy management strategy effectively matches the requirements of system operation. Furthermore, comparison of hybrid systems with and without tidal current turbines is undertaken to confirm that the utilization of tidal current turbines can contribute to enhancing system reliability and reducing system investment, especially in areas with abundant tidal energy sources.},

ABSTRACT = {Biorefineries are novel, productive models that are aimed at producing biobased alternatives to many fossil-based products. Biomass supply and overall energy consumptions are important issues determining the overall biorefinery sustainability. Low-profit lands appear to be a potential option for the sustainable production of raw materials without competition with the food chain. Cardoon particularly matches these characteristics, thanks to the rapid growth and the economy of the cultivation and harvesting steps. An integrated biorefinery processing 60 kton/y cardoon lignocellulosic biomass for the production of 1,4-butanediol (bio-BDO) is presented and discussed in this work. After designing the biorefinery flowsheet, the mass and energy balances were calculated. The results indicated that the energy recovery system has been designed to almost completely cover the entire energy requirement of the BDO production process. Despite the lower supply of electricity, the energy recovery system can cover around 78% of the total electricity demand. Instead, the thermal energy recovery system was able to satisfy the overall demand of the sugar production process entirely, while BDO purification columns require high-pressure steam. The thermal energy recovery system can cover around 83% of the total thermal demand. Finally, a cradle-to-gate simplified environmental assessment was conducted in order to evaluate the environmental impact of the process in terms of carbon footprint. The carbon footprint value calculated for the entire production process of BDO was 2.82 kgCO2eq/kgBDO. The cultivation phase accounted for 1.94 kgCO2eq/kgBDO, the transport had very little impact, only for 0.067 kgCO2eq/kgBDO, while the biorefinery phase contributes for 0.813 kgCO2eq/kgBDO.},

ABSTRACT = {Increasing the use of renewable energy sources is one of the most important goals of energy policies in several countries to build a sustainable energy future. This contribution proposes the synthesis of a biorefinery supply network for a case study of the European Union (EU-27) under several scenarios based on a mathematical programming approach. Several biomass and waste sources, such as grains, waste oils, and lignocellulosics, are proposed to be utilized, and various biofuels including first, second, and third generations are produced such as bioethanol, green gasoline, biodiesel, Fischer Tropsch (FT) diesel, and hydrogen. The aim of this study is to evaluate the capabilities of EU-27 countries to be able to meet the Renewable Energy Directive (RED II) target regarding the share of renewable energy in the transport sector by 2030 in each Member State while not compromising the current production of food. A generic mathematical model has been developed for the multi-period optimization of a biorefinery supply network with the objective of maximizing sustainability profit. The solutions obtained show that biomass and waste are promising raw materials to reach and go beyond the EU’s renewable energy target in the transport sector for the year 2030. However, some countries would need to provide additional subsidies for their companies to achieve at least a non-negative economic performance of biofuel production.},

ABSTRACT = {Biomass-derived sugars are platform molecules that can be converted into a variety of final products. Non-food, lignocellulosic feedstocks, such as agroforest residues and low inputs, high yield crops, are attractive bioresources for the production of second-generation sugars. Biorefining schemes based on the use of versatile technologies that operate at mild conditions contribute to the sustainability of the bio-based products. The present work describes the conversion of giant reed (Arundo donax), a non-food crop, to ethanol and furfural (FA). A sulphuric-acid-catalyzed steam explosion was used for the biomass pretreatment and fractionation. A hybrid process was optimized for the hydrolysis and fermentation (HSSF) of C6 sugars at high gravity conditions consisting of a biomass pre-liquefaction followed by simultaneous saccharification and fermentation with a step-wise temperature program and multiple inoculations. Hemicellulose derived xylose was dehydrated to furfural on the solid acid catalyst in biphasic media irradiated by microwave energy. The results indicate that the optimized HSSF process produced ethanol titers in the range 43–51 g/L depending on the enzymatic dosage, about 13–21 g/L higher than unoptimized conditions. An optimal liquefaction time before saccharification and fermentation tests (SSF) was 10 h by using 34 filter paper unit (FPU)/g glucan of Cellic® CTec3. C5 streams yielded 33.5% FA of the theoretical value after 10 min of microwave heating at 157 °C and a catalyst concentration of 14 meq per g of xylose.},

ABSTRACT = {Flat plate solar collector has been presented as an example of a heat-exchanger with two input signals, solar radiation intensity and temperature of working medium on the input, and one output signal, the temperature of a working medium on the output. The dynamics of heat exchange were analyzed for two models of a solar collector—an analog one using a thermoelectric analogy, and a digital one—determined experimentally in on-line mode using the parametric identification method. The characteristics of both models were compared in terms of their step and frequency response for selected construction and operational parameters. Tests of step responses determined for the analog model indicate that the dynamics of heat exchange in the solar collector depending on two input signals is varied. For step-forcing of input signals of the analog model, in both cases, a stable steady state is achieved, but while the first of the signals is inertial, the second one is oscillatory. The phenomenon of temperature oscillation at the collector outlet suggests the need to introduce a new physical quantity in the thermoelectric analogy-thermal inductance. Such an assessment of the dynamics of the solar collector can be useful for proper designing (construction parameters simulation) and diagnostics (operational parameters simulation) of the device.},

ABSTRACT = {In the global transformation of energy systems, solar energy plays a prominent role, since the energy from our star is a limitless and clean resource, which is available practically almost everywhere. In spite of the immense advancements of photovoltaic systems, which utilize this source of energy, no in-depth research has been carried out regarding the present Hungarian status of the small-scale photovoltaic power plants, the most common type of solar power plant in Hungary. The novelty of this study is that it examines the number and power of these small-scale power plants at the settlement level within the service areas of the various distribution companies, by also considering the economic and infrastructural dimensions of the settlements. The paper seeks answers to the questions whether there are any significant relationships between the number and the power of power plants of this type and the indicators of the settlements, and if so, how strong they are. Besides pairwise correlations, the study also involved the analysis of the relationship between the ranking of the settlements based on the settlements’ complex indicators that were created from the settlements’ indicators and the ranking of the settlements according to the number and power of household-sized photovoltaic power plants per 1000 people. In the course of exploring the relationships, a regression model was also devised concerning the number of household-sized photovoltaic power plants and the settlement indicators.},

ABSTRACT = {The motion of a solid particle introduced into a stream of fluid is a crucial problem in the contexts of pneumatic transport and the purification and separation of non-uniform mixtures. However, the complexity of the underlying equations of motion enforces the creation of semi-empirical models. Therefore, analysis of particle motion in a pneumatic channel was performed. To reduce the number of independent variables, several simplifying assumptions were made in regard to both the particle and the stream. The resulting model provides trajectory equations for a particle introduced into the stream at given values of the initial angle and initial velocity, which are then solved using numerical integration methods. A hodograph function was formulated on the basis of the Runge–Kutta and NDFs methods to test the correctness of the solutions under various initial parameters and to provide a universal method of solving the equations of motion. To verify the model, terminal velocities were measured and particle trajectories recorded using an original experimental stand. The predictions of the model were subsequently compared to these empirical trajectories and were found to fall within the range of uncertainty.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper addresses the study of a pyro-gasification plant designed, built, and operated to recover inert metals from different types of solid waste. Experimental tests were carried out using pulper as the solid waste. However, while a reliable composition analysis of the produced syngas was carried out, a precise composition evaluation of the pulper used during the experimental activities was not performed and the related data were characterized by unacceptable uncertainty. Therefore, with the aim of reliably characterizing the plant operation, a thermochemical model of the gasification process was setup to simulate the equilibrium operation of the plant and a vector optimization methodology was used to calibrate the numerical model. Then, a decision-making problem was solved to identify the most suitable optimal solution between those belonging to the Pareto optimal front, thus obtaining reliable composition data for the adopted pulper waste. In particular, four different identification criteria were applied for the selection of small subset of solutions over the 3138 dominant solutions found. Among them, the solution (i.e., set of calibration parameters) that minimizes the experimental-numerical difference between the lower heating value of the produced syngas seemed to provide the most reliable approximation of the real plant operation. Finally, a possible plant configuration is proposed for the energetic valorization of the pulper waste and its overall conversion process efficiency is estimated.},

ABSTRACT = {In this study, we investigated thermophilic (55 °C) anaerobic digestion (AD) performance and microbial community structure, before and after hydrogen addition, in a novel hybrid gas-stirred tank reactor (GSTR) implemented with a partial immobilization of the microbial community and fed with second cheese whey (SCW). The results showed that H2 addition led to a 25% increase in the methane production rate and to a decrease of 13% in the CH4 concentration as compared with the control. The recovery of methane content (56%) was reached by decreasing the H2 flow rate. The microbial community investigations were performed on effluent (EF) and on interstitial matrix (IM) inside the immobilized area. Before H2 addition, the Anaerobaculaceae (42%) and Lachnospiraceae (27%) families dominated among bacteria in the effluent, and the Thermodesulfobiaceae (32%) and Lachnospiraceae (30%) families dominated in the interstitial matrix. After H2 addition, microbial abundance showed an increase in the bacteria and archaea communities in the interstitial matrix. The Thermodesulfobiaceae family (29%)remained dominant in the interstitial matrix, suggesting its crucial role in the immobilized community and the SHA-31 family was enriched in both the effluent (36%) and the interstitial matrix (15%). The predominance of archaea Methanothermobacter thermoautrophicus indicated that CH4 was produced almost exclusively by the hydrogenotrophic pathway.},

ABSTRACT = {In order to improve the efficiency of the diesel engine and reduce emissions, an improved heat transfer model was developed in an AVL-BOOST environment which is a powerful and user-friendly software for engine steady-state and transient performance analysis. The improved heat transfer model considers the advantages of the Woschni1978 heat transfer model and Honhenberg heat transfer model. In addition, a five-component biodiesel skeletal mechanism containing 475 reactions and 134 species was developed to simulate the fuel spray process and combustion process since it contained methyl linolenate, methyl linoleate, methyl oleate, methyl stearate, and methyl palmitate, which are a majority component in most biodiesel. Finally, the propulsion and load characteristics of a diesel engine fueled with biodiesel fuel were investigated by the improved heat transfer model in term of power, brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC), soot and NOx emissions. Similarly, the effects of the fuel injection rate on the diesel engine’s characteristic fueled with biodiesel was studied. The result showed that the errors between experiment and simulation were less than 2%. Thus, the simulation model could predict the propulsion and load characteristics of the diesel engine. The nozzle diameter, injection pressure, and injection advance angle are significant to the injection system. Thus, it is very important to choose the injection rate reasonably.},

ABSTRACT = {Identification of ongoing processes in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) enables both optimizing the operating environment and prolonging the lifetime of SOFC. The Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm (LMA) is commonly used in the characterization of unknown electrochemical processes within SOFC by extracting equivalent electrical circuit (EEC) parameter values from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data. LMA is an iteration optimization algorithm regularly applied to solve complex nonlinear least square (CNLS) problems. The LMA convergence can be boosted by the application of an ordinary limit strategy, which avoids the occurrence of off-limit values during the fit. However, to additionally improve LMA descent properties and to discard the problem of a poor initial parameters choice, it is necessary to modify the ordinary limit strategy. In this work, we designed a new automatic update (i.e., adaptive) limit strategy whose purpose is to reduce the impact of a poor initial parameter choice. Consequently, the adaptive limit strategy was embedded in a newly developed EIS fitting engine. To demonstrate that the new adaptive (vs. ordinary) limit strategy is superior, we used it to solve several CNLS problems. The applicability of the adaptive limit strategy was also validated by analyzing experimental EIS data collected by using industrial-scale SOFCs.},

ABSTRACT = {The results of optimisation calculations presented in the article are related to longitudinally finned tubes of a heat pump evaporator operating under natural wind-induced flow of outdoor air conditions. The finned surface is characterised by an unusual, wavy fin shape. The article presents the methodology applied to seeking optimal geometric parameters of the finned tube in which thermal calculations were performed by modelling a mixed convection process on the finned surface using the finite volume method. In the case of maximising the heat flow with the minimum mass of the fins, the optimal solution was dominated by the minimum mass of the fins and thus geometric parameters correspond to the number of fins n = 6, fin height h = 0.065 and fin thickness s = 0.0015 m. Optimisation calculations made for maximum efficiency of the exchanger at constant mass indicated that the tube with ten fins (n = 10) with a height of h = 0.11 m and a thickness of s = 0.0018 m allowed maximum heat flow at the assumed mass of the fins in the exchanger tube model. The article proposes a simplified method of determining the optimal geometric parameters of the profile for any mass and maximum thermal efficiency.},

ABSTRACT = {A novel procedure to determine the environmental quality of boilers based on the combustion entropy degradation, the pollutants emission and the device efficiency is proposed. The entropy generation due to the chemical reaction was determined and then the irreversibilities on the external environment were first quantified. Successively, the entropy generation numbers of the combustion reactions were combined with the heat transfer process entropy generation of the boilers to consider the actual functioning conditions, in order to quantify the environmental damages by introducing an Environment Quality Index (EQI). A parametric study varying the heat exchanger efficiency, fluid flow rates and temperatures, for different fuel typologies, was performed to assess the environmental impact. Solar hydrogen was considered for its importance as future renewable energy carrier. The results showed that the highest EQI was produced by the natural gas, but if heat exchanger parameters are defined opportunely, the score gap with other fluids can be recovered. For hydrogen and coal decreasing the flue gases temperature or by increasing the flue gases mass flow rate can strongly improve the EQI index, whereas the gap recovery for Diesel is rather difficult.},

ABSTRACT = {As an alternative to gasoline, bioethanol can be produced from lignocellulosic biomass through hydrolysis using an ionic solution containing zinc chloride (ZnCl2). This method allows for a high yield of glucose from lignocellulose, but entails the removal of ZnCl2 from the hydrolysate using multiple nanofiltration membranes before the fermentation of glucose. This paper presents a mathematical technique for designing such a multistage membrane separation system. The optimization model for the synthesis of membrane networks is based on a superstructure with all feasible interconnections between the membrane units, and consists of mass balances, logical constraints and product specifications. A case study of the separation of a bagasse hydrolysis solution is used to demonstrate the application of the proposed model. Results show that using both types of nanofiltration membranes allows higher ZnCl2 removal ratios at each membrane unit, hence a decrease in the number of membrane units required and a reduction of about 35% in capital cost compared to the cases in which only one membrane type is used. Further analysis is performed to examine the effect of membrane performance on the economics of the separation system.},

ABSTRACT = {The heat transfer, friction factor, and collector efficiency are estimated experimentally for multi-walled carbon nanotubes+Fe3O4 hybrid nanofluid flows in a solar flat plate collector under thermosyphon circulation. The combined technique of in-situ growth and chemical coprecipitation was utilized to synthesize the multi-walled carbon nanotubes+Fe3O4 hybrid nanoparticles. The experiments were carried out at volume flow rates from 0.1 to 0.75 L/min and various concentrations from 0.05% to 0.3%. The viscosity and thermal conductivity of the hybrid nanofluids were experimentally measured at different temperatures and concentrations. Due to the improved thermophysical properties of the hybrid nanofluids, the collector achieved better thermal efficiency. Results show that the maximum thermal conductivity and viscosity enhancements are 28.46% and 50.4% at 0.3% volume concentration and 60 °C compared to water data. The Nusselt number, heat transfer coefficient, and friction factor are augmented by 18.68%, 39.22%, and 18.91% at 0.3% volume concentration and 60 °C over water data at the maximum solar radiation. The collector thermal efficiency improved by 28.09% at 0.3 vol. % at 13:00 h daytime and a Reynolds number of 1413 over water data. Empirical correlations were developed for friction factor and Nusselt number.},

ABSTRACT = {Investigating the transient behaviour of liquid CO2 decompression is of great importance to ensure the safety of pipeline transportation in carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology. A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) decompression model based on the non-equilibrium phase transition and Span–Wagner equation of state (EoS) was developed to study the effects of actual flowing state within the pipeline on the transient behaviour of liquid CO2 decompression. Then, the CFD model was verified by comparing the simulated results to test data of a large-scale “shock tube” with an inner diameter of 146.36 mm. The results showed that the evaporation coefficient had a significant impact on the transition behaviour of CO2 decompression, while the condensation coefficient made no difference. When the evaporation coefficient was 15 s−1, the CFD-predicted results were in good agreement with the test results. Moreover, the effects of flow velocity on transient behaviour of liquid CO2 decompression were further investigated. It was found that the flow velocity affected the temperature drop of liquid CO2 during decompression, thereby affecting the phase transition of liquid CO2. In addition, the initial flow velocity also showed a significant influence on the transient behaviour of CO2 outside the pipe.},

ABSTRACT = {The thermal decomposition of wood chips from an apple tree is studied in a static air atmosphere under isothermal conditions. Based on the thermogravimetric analysis, the values of the apparent activation energy and pre-exponential factor are 34 ± 3 kJ mol−1 and 391 ± 2 min−1, respectively. These results have also shown that this process can be described by the rate of the first-order chemical reaction. This reaction model is valid only for a temperature range of 250–290 °C, mainly due to the lignin decomposition. The obtained results are used for kinetic prediction, which is compared with the measurement. The results show that the reaction is slower at higher values of degree of conversion, which is caused by the influence of the experimental condition. Nevertheless, the obtained kinetic parameters could be used for the optimization of the combustion process of wood chips in small-scale biomass boilers.},

ABSTRACT = {A large eddy simulation (LES) was performed for film cooling in the gas turbine blade involving spanwise injection angles (orientation angles). For a streamwise coolant injection angle (inclination angle) of 35°, the effects of the orientation angle were compared considering a simple angle of 0° and 30°. Two ratios of the coolant to main flow mass flux (blowing ratio) of 0.5 and 1.0 were considered and the experimental conditions of Jung and Lee (2000) were adopted for the geometry and flow conditions. Moreover, a Reynolds averaged Navier–Stokes simulation (RANS) was performed to understand the characteristics of the turbulence models compared to those in the LES and experiments. In the RANS, three turbulence models were compared, namely, the realizable k-ε, k-ω shear stress transport, and Reynolds stress models. The temperature field and flow fields predicted through the RANS were similar to those obtained through the experiment and LES. Nevertheless, at a simple angle, the point at which the counter-rotating vortex pair (CRVP) collided on the wall and rose was different from that in the experiment and LES. Under the compound angle, the point at which the CRVP changed to a single vortex was different from that in the LES. The adiabatic film cooling effectiveness could not be accurately determined through the RANS but was well reflected by the LES, even under the compound angle. The reattachment of the injectant at a blowing ratio of 1.0 was better predicted by the RANS at the compound angle than at the simple angle. The temperature fluctuation was predicted to decrease slightly when the injectant was supplied at a compound angle.},

ABSTRACT = {The coal to ethylene glycol (CTEG) process has drawn much attention due to the serious conflict between supply and demand of ethylene glycol in China. However, it is inevitably accompanied by the problem of high CO2 emissions. Carbon capture is one of the most promising potential effective ways to address this issue. However, the CTEG process, integrated with carbon capture technology, will lead to energy and economic penalties. Thus, a comprehensive evaluation of CTEG process with different CO2 capture technologies is urgently needed. This study analyzed the technoeconomic performance of four CO2 capture alternatives for the CTEG process: Rectisol, mono-ethanol amine (MEA), chilled ammonia process (CAP) and dimethyl carbonate (DMC) technologies. Results show the energy consumption of CO2 capture of the Rectisol process is the lowest, 1.88 GJ/tCO2, followed by the DMC process, 2.10 GJ/tCO2, the CAP process, 3.64 GJ/tCO2, and the MEA process, 5.20 GJ/tCO2. The CO2 capture cost of the Rectisol process is lowest, CNY 169.5/tCO2, followed by the DMC process, CNY 193.2/tCO2, the CAP process CNY 232.6/tCO2, and the MEA process CNY 250.5/tCO2. As the Rectisol technology has the best comprehensive performance, it is the best option for CTEG industry in comparison with the MEA, CAP, and DMC technologies.},

ABSTRACT = {Friction occurs in the processes of transport and storage of granular plant materials used in the energy (RES—Renewable Energy Sources) and food sectors. This paper presents the results of a study on the impact of the moisture content of the material and the number of its contact points with a smooth surface (a steel sheet) on the process of friction in grains of wheat and buckwheat. The friction process was studied for four different levels of moisture (9.5%, 13.5%, 17.5% and 21.5%) and three different average numbers of contact points. To measure the force of friction, an universal testing machine with appropriate instrumentation was used. To determine the number of contact points, computer imaging analysis was conducted. An increase in static and kinetic friction was observed along with the increase in moisture level and the increase in the number of contact points. Correlation and regression analysis was performed for the data obtained.},

ABSTRACT = {The question of electromobility is greatly discussed theme of the present especially in connection with the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. In order to fulfill decarbonization targets, incentives of many countries lead to the support of electromobility. In this paper we ask to which extend are Visegrád Group countries prepared for the widespread utilization of electric cars and define a new coefficient K called the infrastructural country electromobility coefficient. Its computing is covered by appropriate analysis and calculations done previously. Several indices that keep particular information about the state of preparation for electromobility are defined and debated here, as well. Their product forms the coefficient K. Obtained results include outcomes and discussion regarding the level of infrastructural electromobility preparedness for the chosen states, among which we extra focus on the position of Slovakia compared to the European Union average and European electromobility leaders. Based on the data obtained, we found out that the stage of preparation of Slovakia for electromobility among Visegrad Group countries is rather good, although it is far behind the European Union leaders. We realized that there was a rapid growth of electromobility infrastructure in Slovak Republic in the last five years as its infrastructural country electromobility coefficient grew 334 times.},

ABSTRACT = {Thermochemical processes utilizing biomass demonstrate promising prospects for the generation of syngas. In this work, a gasification process employing combination of an indigenous low-grade coal with two distinct biomass sources, namely rice husk (RH) and wood sawdust (WS), was explored. The gasification of the selected feedstock was performed using a double-staged multi-opposite burner (MOB) gasifier. A 3D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model was employed to analyze the effect of kinetic and diffusion rates on the overall gasification performance of an entrained flow biomass gasifier. DPM was employed to track the particles’ trajectory, while the gas phase was treated as the continuous phase, and its behavior was predicted using a standard k-epsilon turbulent model. To calculate both the homogeneous and heterogeneous reaction rates, the finite rate/eddy dissipation model was implemented. The findings indicate that the char conversion efficiency exceeded 95% across all instances. Among the different reaction schemes, scheme E (which involved complete volatile and char combustion reactions) produced better results in comparison with published results, with less than 1% error. Hence, scheme E was validated and utilized for the rest of the simulated cases. The feeding rate has an inverse effect on the overall performance of the gasifier. An increase in feed rate decreases the CO and H2 composition in syngas. The maximum CO value was observed to be 57.59% at a 1.0 O/C ratio with a 0.005 kg/s feed rate, and the maximum H2 value was observed to be 16.58% in the same conditions for Lakhra coal samples. In summary, Lakhra coal exhibited better performance than other biomass samples due to its better fixed carbon and volatiles in its composition.},

ABSTRACT = {Oil lubricates the contact between the orbiting and stationary scroll in the refrigerant scroll compressor, while the sealing between the scrolls is achieved through the refrigerant vapour pressure in the sealed back pressure chamber. The back pressure should be adjusted using the refrigerant oil two-phase flow from the oil separator at the compressor discharge to the back pressure chamber and the refrigerant oil flow from the back pressure chamber to the compressor suction side. Both of the flows are conducted through connecting tubes with corresponding high-pressure and low-pressure nozzles with small diameters. Models for predicting the refrigerant oil critical and subcritical flows through the nozzles were developed and applied in enable the prediction of the back pressure. The models are original, because the slip between the oil and the refrigerant as well as the refrigerant solubility in the oil are taken into account. The critical flow model is validated against the experimental data that are available in the literature. The back pressure is predicted by equating the mass flow rates of refrigerant and oil two-phase mixtures through the high- and low-pressure nozzles. The results show that the critical flow takes place through the high-pressure nozzle, while the subcritical flow through the low-pressure nozzle can also exist in cases with a small pressure difference between the back pressure chamber and the compressor suction side. The refrigerant solubility in the oil has a small influence on the critical and subcritical refrigerant oil mixture mass flow rates, while the influence on the back pressure is more pronounced.},

ABSTRACT = {A pumping-while-tripping method is proposed to mitigate pressure swabs during tripping out in wells with a narrow mud density window and extended reach. In the proposed tripping-out process, the fluid circulation is started by using a special pump from a customized circulation line before tripping is initiated. During the tripping out, drilling fluid is circulated in the wellbore simultaneously while the drilling string is moving. A model to simulate the dynamic pressure changes in this process is developed based on the Navier–Stokes (N-S) equations and a damped free vibration system. The model was initially developed for Herschel–Bulkley (H-B) fluid; however, it can be applied to other fluid models by eliminating the non-existing terms. An analysis was conducted to investigate the effect of tripping velocity and circulation pumping rate on the pressure changes. The results show that pumping-while-tripping is effective in mitigating the pressure swab during tripping out, which is especially useful for extended-reach wells. It can also help to increase tripping out velocity and save tripping time for drilling operations.},

ABSTRACT = {The Fengcheng Formation in the Mahu Sag of the Junggar Basin, China, is characterized by alkaline lake deposits, featuring abundant alkaline minerals. The content of alkaline minerals affects the physical properties and oil-bearing properties of the reservoir, and existing mineral inversion methods cannot calculate the content of alkaline minerals. Based on Litho Scanner Log data, we can calculate the dry weight of elements using the oxide closure model. By improving the rock volume physical model; adding trona, shortite, eitelite, and reedmergnerite to the rock volume physical model; and combining with the least squares method, the mineral content calculation was carried out, using the inversion method of combination models (Shortite Model, Eitelite Model, Reedmergnerite Model, and Trona Model) to achieve mineral inversion of alkali-bearing shale oil reservoirs. Litho Scanner Log is expensive, and its widespread application will increase exploration costs. This article scales the mineral inversion results of Litho Scanner Log into conventional log data, improves the rock volume physical model of conventional log, and uses a combination model to achieve mineral inversion of alkali-bearing shale oil reservoirs in conventional log. Compared with the results of X-ray diffraction experiments, the average absolute error of all minerals except for trona and feldspar is less than 10%, and the inversion results are consistent with the core test results. The research results of this article can provide theoretical and technical support for the log evaluation of alkali-bearing shale oil reservoirs.},

ABSTRACT = {A floatation nozzle can effectively transfer heat and dry without touching the substrate, and serves as a vital component for heat transfer to the substrate. Enhancing the heat transfer performance, and reducing its heat transfer unevenness to the substrate play an important role in improving product quality and reducing thermal stress. In this work, the effects of key structural parameters of the floatation nozzle on the heat transfer mechanism are systematically investigated by means of a numerical simulation of computational fluid dynamics. The findings demonstrate that the secondary vortex structure induced by the floatation nozzle with effusion holes increases heat transfer performance by 254.3% compared with the nozzle without effusion holes. The turbulent kinetic energy and temperature distribution between the jet and the target surface are affected by the jet angle and slit width respectively, which change the heat transfer performance of the float nozzle in different degrees. Furthermore, to improve the comprehensive heat transfer performance of the floatation nozzle structure, taking into account the average heat transfer capability and heat transfer uniformity, the floatation nozzle’s design is optimized by the application of the response surface method. The comprehensive heat transfer performance is increased by 26.48% with the optimized design parameters. Our work is of practical value for the design of floatation nozzles with high heat transfer performance to improve product quality in industrial systems.},

ABSTRACT = {The pre-tightening force loss (PTFL) of bolts is an important but underestimated cause of roadway instability. In mine anchorage systems, the actual pre-tightening force of bolts is only 50% to 80% of the design value. Through a case study at Xiahuo Coal Mine, it was found that the essential causes of PTFL are the increasing friction coefficient between supporting units controlled by factors such as pre-tightening torque levels, pre-tightening cycles, and surrounding rock roughness. This study investigates the behavioral characteristics of PTFL and its influence on surrounding rock failure in roadways. This research reveals a linear correlation between pre-tightening force and torque, with an average torque conversion coefficient of approximately 0.19. However, the PTFL increases with higher levels of pre-tightening torque, increasing pre-tightening cycles, and rougher surrounding rock conditions. For every 30 N·m increase in pre-tightening torque, the PTFL increases by approximately 1.67 kN. Reducing the PTFL can expedite the stress redistribution process and shorten the self-stabilizing period of the roadway by approximately 10 days, thereby enhancing the active supporting potential of bolts.},

ABSTRACT = {Shale oil resources, noted for their broad distribution and significant reserves, are increasingly recognized as vital supplements to traditional oil resources. In response to the high fracturing costs and swift decline in productivity associated with shale oil horizontal wells, this research introduces a novel approach utilizing CO2 for enhanced shale oil recovery in radial boreholes. A compositional numerical simulation method is built accounted for component diffusion, adsorption, and non-Darcy flow, to explore the viability of this technique. The study examines how different factors—such as initial reservoir pressure, permeability, numbers of radial boreholes, and their branching patterns—influence oil production and CO2 storage. Our principal conclusions indicate that with a constant CO2 injection rate, lower initial reservoir pressures predominantly lead to immiscible oil displacement, hastening the occurrence of CO2 gas channeling. Therefore, maintaining higher initial or injection pressures is critical for effective miscible displacement in CO2-enhanced recovery using radial boreholes. Notably, the adsorption of CO2 in shale oil results in the displacement of lighter hydrocarbons, an effect amplified by competitive adsorption. While CO2 diffusion tends to prompt earlier gas channeling, its migration towards areas of lower concentration within the reservoir reduces the extent of channeling CO2. Nonetheless, when reservoir permeability falls below 0.01 mD, the yield from CO2-enhanced recovery using radial boreholes is markedly low. Hence, selecting high-permeability “sweet spot” regions within shale oil reservoirs for the deployment of this method is advisable. To boost oil production, utilizing longer and broader radial boreholes, increasing the number of boreholes, or setting the phase angle to 0° are effective strategies. Finally, by comparing the production of shale oil enhanced by CO2 with that of a dual horizontal well fracturing system enhanced by CO2, it was found that although the former’s oil production is only 50.6% of the latter, its cost is merely 11.1%, thereby proving its economic viability. These findings present a new perspective for the economically efficient extraction of shale oil, offering potential guidance for industrial practices.},

ABSTRACT = {Traditional research on apparent permeability in shale reservoirs has mainly focussed on effects such as poromechanics and porosity-assisted adsorption layers. However, for a more realistic representation of field conditions, a comprehensive multi-scale and multi-flowing mechanism model, considering the fracturing process, has not been thoroughly explored. To address this research gap, this study introduces an innovative workflow for dynamic permeability assessment. Initially, an accurate description of the pore size distribution (PSD) within three major mineral types in shale is developed using focussed ion beam-scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data. Subsequently, an apparent permeability model is established by combining the PSD data, leading to the derivation of dynamic permeability. Finally, the PSD-related dynamic permeability model is refined by incorporating the effects of imbibition resulting from the fracturing process preceding shale gas production. The developed dynamic permeability model varies with pore and fracture pressures in the shale reservoir. The fracturing process induces water blockage, water-film formation, and water-bridging phenomena in shale, requiring additional pressure inputs to counteract capillary effects in hydrophilic minerals in shale, But also increases the overall permeability from increasing permeability at larger scale pores. Unlike traditional reservoirs, the production process commences when the fracture is depleted to 1–2 MPa exceeds the pore pressure, facilitated by the high concentration of hydrophobic organic matter pores in shale, this phenomenon explains the gas production at the intial production stage. The reduction in adsorption-layer thickness resulting from fracturing impacts permeability on a nano-scale by diminishing surface diffusion and the corresponding slip flow of gas. this phenomenon increases viscous-flow permeability from enlarged flow spacing, but the increased viscous flow does not fully offset the reduction caused by adsorbed-gas diffusion and slip flow. In addition to the phenomena arising from various field conditions, PSD in shale emerges as a crucial factor in determining dynamic permeability. Furthermore, considering the same PSD in shale, under identical pore spacing, the shape factor of slit-like clay minerals significantly influences overall permeability characteristics, much more slit-shaped pores(higher shape factor) reduce the overall permeability. The dynamic permeability-assisted embedded discrete fracture model (EDFM) showed higher accuracy in predicting shale gas production compared to the original model.},

ABSTRACT = {Effective fluid-loss control in oil wells is a critical concern for the oil industry, particularly given the substantial reserves situated in carbonate reservoirs globally. The prevalence of such reservoirs is expected to rise with the slow depletion of hydrocarbons, intensifying the need to address challenges related to deteriorating reservoir properties post well-killing operations. This deterioration results in significant annual losses in hydrocarbon production at major oil enterprises, impacting key performance indicators. To tackle this issue, this study focuses on enhancing well-killing technology efficiency in carbonate reservoirs with abnormally low formation pressures. To address this issue, the authors propose the development of new blocking compositions that prevent the fluid loss of treatment fluids by the productive reservoir. The research tasks include a comprehensive analysis of global experience in well-killing technology; the development of blocking compositions; an investigation of their physico-chemical, rheological, and filtration properties; and an evaluation of their effectiveness in complicated conditions. The technology’s application in the oil and gas condensate fields of the Volga-Ural province showcases its practical implementation. This study provides valuable insights and solutions for improved fluid-loss control in carbonate reservoirs, ultimately enhancing well performance and hydrocarbon recovery.},

ABSTRACT = {The thermal storage performance of shell and tube phase change heat storage units is greatly influenced by the thermophysical parameters of the phase change material (PCM). Therefore, we use numerical simulations to examine how the thermal storage capability of shell and tube phase change heat storage units is affected by thermophysical parameters such as specific heat capacity, thermal conductivity, and latent heat of phase change. The findings indicate that while the rate of temperature increase and the rate of the PCM melting both slow down as specific heat capacity increases, the overall heat storage increases. Within the specified range of parameters, the average rate of heat storage increases by approximately 4% for every 50% increase in specific heat capacity. The PCM’s rate of temperature rise slows down and its overall heat storage capacity rises throughout the middle stage of the phase change heat storage process as the latent heat of phase change grows. The average heat storage rate increases by approximately 6% and 22% for every 50% increase in latent heat and thermal conductivity, respectively. Notably, when the thermal conductivity is enhanced by a factor of 1.5, the average heat storage rate experiences an almost 50% increase. The thermal conductivity of the PCM has a negligible impact on total heat storage. The choice and use of the PCM in shell and tube phase change heat storage heat exchangers has a theoretical and empirical foundation thanks to this work.},

ABSTRACT = {The bottomhole pressure is one of the key parameters for oilfield development and decision-making. However, due to factors such as cost and equipment failure, bottomhole pressure data is often lacking. In this paper, we established a GA-XGBoost model to predict the bottomhole pressure in carbonate reservoirs. Firstly, a total of 413 datasets, including daily oil production, daily water production, daily gas production, daily liquid production, daily gas injection rate, gas–oil ratio, and bottomhole pressure, were collected from 14 wells through numerical simulation. The production data were then subjected to standardized preprocessing and dimensionality reduction using a principal component analysis. The data were then split into training, testing, and validation sets with a ratio of 7:2:1. A prediction model for the bottomhole pressure in carbonate reservoirs based on XGBoost was developed. The model parameters were optimized using a genetic algorithm, and the average adjusted R-squared score from the cross-validation was used as the optimization metric. The model achieved an adjusted R-squared score of 0.99 and a root-mean-square error of 0.0015 on the training set, an adjusted R-squared score of 0.84 and a root-mean-square error of 0.0564 on the testing set, and an adjusted R-squared score of 0.69 and a root-mean-square error of 0.0721 on the validation set. The results demonstrated that in the case of fewer data variables, the GA-XGBoost model had a high accuracy and good generalization performance, and its performance was superior to other models. Through this method, it is possible to quickly predict the bottomhole pressure data of carbonate rocks while saving measurement costs.},

ABSTRACT = {Liquid nitrogen (LN2) fracturing is a potential stimulation method in unconventional hydrocarbon recovery, showing its merits in being water free, creating low formation damage and being environmentally friendly. The microstructure evolution of rocks subjected to LN2 cooling is a fundamental concern for the engineering application of LN2 fracturing. In this paper, pore-scale imaging and characterization were performed on two rocks, i.e., tight sandstone and coal specimens subjected to LN2 cooling using computed tomography scanning. The digital core technique was employed to reconstruct the microstructures of rocks and give a quantitative analysis of the pore structure evolution of both dry and water-saturated rocks. The results indicate that LN2 cooling has a great effect on the pores’ morphology and their spatial distribution, leading to a great improvement in pore diameter and aspect ratio. When compared to the sandstone, coal is more sensitive to LN2 cooling and thermal stresses, having a more noticeable growth in pore–throat size. The porosity growth of coal is 291% higher than that of sandstone. There is a growing trend in the irregularity and complexity of pore structures. After LN2 cooling, the fractal dimensions of the pores of sandstone and coal grow by 11.7% and 0.87%, respectively, and the proportion of pores with a shape factor > 100 increases. More bundle-like and strip-shape pores with multiple branches are generated, which causes a significant growth in the throat size and the proportion of connected pores with a coordination number ≥ 1, enhancing the complexity and connectivity of pore structures dramatically. Additionally, pore water plays an important role in aggravating rock damage during LN2 cooling, enhancing the pore space and connectivity. The porosities of the saturated sandstone and coal samples grow by 22.6% and 490.4%, respectively, after LN2 cooling, which are 5.6% and 186.6% higher than dry samples. The generation of macropores ≥ 70 μm is the primary contributor to porosity growth during LN2 cooling, although such pores account for only a small proportion of the total. These findings contribute to our understanding of the microscopic mechanism of LN2 cooling on rock damage and may provide some guidance for the engineering application of LN2 fracturing.},

ABSTRACT = {The construction and development of energy storage are crucial areas in the reform of China’s power system. However, one of the key issues hindering energy storage investments is the ambiguity of revenue sources and the inaccurate estimation of returns. In order to facilitate investors’ understanding of revenue sources and returns on investment of energy storage in the existing electricity market, this study has established multiple relevant revenue quantification models. The research methodology employed in this paper consists of three main components: Firstly, we established a revenue model and a cost model for energy storage participation in the electricity market. These models focus on arbitrage revenue, subsidy revenue, auxiliary services revenue, investment cost, operational and maintenance cost, and auxiliary service cost of energy storage. Subsequently, we utilized an enhanced Grey Wolf Optimizer algorithm to solve the optimization problem and maximize revenue, thus obtaining the optimal capacity and revenue scale of energy storage in the electricity market. Finally, we compared the whole-lifecycle ROI of different energy storage options in various scenarios. The evaluation results demonstrate that the difference between peak and off-peak loads impacts the investment demand and charging/discharging depth of energy storage. In addition, the discrepancy between peak and off-peak prices affects the arbitrage return of energy storage. These two factors can serve as criteria for energy storage investors to assess their return expectations.

ABSTRACT = {Reactivating oil and gas wells, increasing oil and gas production, and improving recovery provide more opportunities for energy supply especially in the extraction of unconventional oil and gas reservoirs. Due to changes caused by well completion and production in pore pressure around oil and gas wells, subsequently leading to changes in ground stress, and the presence of natural and induced fractures in the reservoir, the process of refracturing is highly complex. This complexity is particularly pronounced in shale oil reservoirs with developed weak layer structures. Through true triaxial hydraulic fracturing experiments on Jimsar shale and utilizing micro-CT to characterize fractures, this study investigates the mechanisms and patterns of refracturing. The research indicates: (1) natural fractures and the stress states in the rock are the primary influencing factors in the fracture propagation. Because natural fractures are widely developed in Jimsar shale, natural fractures are the main influencing factors of hydraulic fracturing, especially in refracturing, the existing fractures have a greater impact on the propagation of secondary fracturing fractures. (2) Successful sealing of existing fractures using temporary blocking agents is crucial for initiating new fractures in refracturing. Traditional methods of plugging the seam at the root of existing fractures are ineffective, whereas extensive injection of blocking agents, forming large “sheet-like” blocking bodies in old fractures, yields better sealing effects, promoting the initiation of new fractures. (3) Moderately increasing the pumping rate and viscosity of fracturing fluid is advantageous in forming “sheet-like” temporary blocking bodies, enhancing the complexity of the network of new fractures in refracturing. (4) When there is a high horizontal stress difference, after sealing old fractures, the secondary hydraulic fractures initiate parallel to and extend from the old fractures. In cases of low horizontal stress difference, the complexity of secondary hydraulic fractures increases. When the horizontal stress changes direction, the secondary hydraulic fractures also change direction. It is recommended to use high-viscosity fracturing fluid and moderately increase the pumping rate, injecting blocking agents to seal old fractures, thereby enhancing the complexity of the network of refracturing. These findings provide important technical guidance for improving the efficiency of shale oil reservoir development.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper presents a new grid-forming strategy for hybrid AC/DC microgrids using bidirectional virtual inertia support designed to address weak grid conditions. The stability of hybrid AC/DC microgrids heavily relies on the AC mains frequency and the DC-link voltage, and deviations in these factors can lead to undesirable outcomes such as load curtailments and power system congestions and blackouts. This paper introduces a unique approach that leverages bidirectional virtual inertia support to enhance the stability and reliability of hybrid AC/DC microgrids under weak grid conditions. The proposed strategy employs virtual inertia as a buffer to mitigate rapid changes in DC-link voltage and AC frequency, thereby enhancing system stability margins. This strategy significantly contributes to a more stable and reliable grid operation by reducing voltage and frequency fluctuations. A standard hybrid AC/DC microgrid configuration is used to implement the bidirectional virtual inertia support, where a bidirectional interlinking converter control is adjusted to deliver inertia support to both the AC and DC subgrids. This converter utilizes the DC grid voltage and AC grid frequency as inputs, effectively managing active power balance and implementing auxiliary functions. Extensive simulations are conducted under weak grid conditions and standalone mode to validate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy. The simulation results demonstrate a remarkable improvement in frequency nadir, rate-of-change-of-frequency (RoCoF), and DC bus voltage deviation in the hybrid AC/DC microgrids. The bidirectional virtual inertia support substantially reduces voltage and frequency fluctuations, enhancing the microgrid stability and resilience. There is an improvement of over 45% and 25% in the frequency deviation and voltage deviation, respectively, achieved through implementing the proposed control strategy.},

ABSTRACT = {Hydrogen energy, as a clean and green energy medium, is characterized by large capacity, extended lifespan, convenient storage, and seamless transmission. On the one hand, in the power system, hydrogen can be prepared by the electrolysis of water using the surplus power from intermittent new energy generation, such as photovoltaic and wind power, to increase the space for new energy consumption. On the other hand, it can be used to generate electricity from the chemical reaction between hydrogen and oxygen through the fuel cell and be used as a backup power source when there is a shortage of power supply. In this paper, based on the teaching practice, the conversion mechanism and coupling relationship between various forms of energy, such as photovoltaic energy, hydrogen energy, and electric energy, were deeply analyzed. Further, a hydrogen-electricity coupling digital simulation experimental system, including photovoltaic power generation, fuel cell, and electrolysis hydrogen system, was formed. Simultaneously, considering the synergy between hydrogen production and electricity generation businesses, as well as the demand for the efficient utilization and flexible regulation of multiple energy sources, eight sets of simulation experimental scenarios were designed. A cooperative control strategy for the hydrogen-electric coupling system was proposed and validated through simulation on the MATLAB/SIMULINK-R2023a platform. This study shows that the simulation system has rich experimental scenarios and control strategies, and can comprehensively and accurately demonstrate the multi-energy complementary and cooperative control characteristics of the hydrogen-electric coupling system.},

ABSTRACT = {The permeability of low-permeability cores is generally measured using a pulse decay method. The core of low-permeability rocks, such as shale, often has a layered structure. The applicability of pulse decay testing for layered cores is not clear. In this study, the performance of the pulse decay method on layered cores was comprehensively investigated. Numerical simulations were conducted to investigate the influence of the interlayer permeability ratio, storativity ratio, layer thickness, interlayer location, and number of layers on the pulse decay pressure and pressure derivative curves, as well as the permeability obtained from pulse decay testing. The results revealed that the pressure curves of layered cores exhibit distinct differences from those of homogeneous cores if the upstream permeability is larger than the downstream one. The pressure derivative curve shows more inclined or horizontal straight-line segments than in the homogeneous case. The shapes of the pressure and pressure derivative curves are affected by the upstream and downstream positions of the core, but the tested permeability is not affected. The tested permeability differs from the equivalent model permeability, with an error of up to 22%. If the number of layers is not less than 10, the permeability obtained from the pulse decay test is consistent with that of the equivalent model. These differences are influenced by the interlayer permeability ratio, storativity ratio, layer thickness, interlayer location, and number of layers. To improve the accuracy of permeability analysis in pulse decay testing for layered cores, curve fitting using the characteristics of the pressure derivative curve can be employed.},

ABSTRACT = {Based on the background of dynamic mining pressure monitoring and pressure prediction research on the No. 232205 working face of the Meihuajing coal mine, this study systematically investigates the predictive model of mining pressure manifestation on the working face of the Meihuajing coal mine by integrating methods such as engineering investigation, theoretical analysis, and mathematical modeling. A mining pressure manifestation prediction method based on IA-PSO-BP is proposed. The IA-PSO optimization algorithm is applied to optimize the hyperparameters of the BP neural network, and the working face mining pressure prediction model based on IA-PSO-BP is established. The mean absolute error (MAE), mean square error (MSE), and coefficient of determination (R2) are selected as evaluation indicators to compare the prediction performance of the BP model, PSO-BP model, and IA-PSO-BP model. The experimental results of the model show that the convergence speed of the IA-PSO-BP model is about eight times faster than that of the BP model and two times faster than that of the PSO-BP model. Compared with the BP and PSO-BP models, the IA-PSO-BP model has the smallest MAE and MSE and the largest R2 on the three different data sets of the test set, indicating significantly improved prediction accuracy. The predicted results conform to the periodic variation pattern of mining pressure data and are consistent with the actual situation in the coal mine.},

ABSTRACT = {The preparation of activated carbons (ACs) from cherry stones and chemical activation with H3PO4 can be controlled by the experimental variables during the impregnation step in order to obtain a tailored porous structure of the as-prepared ACs. This control not only extends to the ACs’ texture and porosity development, but also to the chemical nature of their surface. The spectroscopic and elemental characterization of different series of ACs is presented in this study. The spectroscopic band features and assignments strongly depend on the H3PO4 concentration and/or the semi-carbonization treatments applied to the feedstock before impregnation, which ultimately influence different characteristics such as the AC hydrophilicity. Different surface chemistries arise from the different tailored impregnation solutions, showing a practical outcome for future applications of the as-prepared ACs.},

ABSTRACT = {The Modular Multilevel Converter (MMC) has been widely used in high-power applications owing to its inherent advantages, including scalability, modularity, high-power density, and fault tolerance. MMCs have recently been used in Low-Frequency Alternating Current (LFAC) transmission, particularly in the integration of offshore wind power with onshore grids. However, LFAC applications produce significant voltage oscillations in floating capacitor voltages within the MMC. Early research efforts have successfully established and validated decoupled control strategies for LFAC-based MMC systems. However, validations are usually based on simulations or small-scale prototypes equipped with limited power cells. Consequently, this paper presents a decentralized voltage control strategy based on Nearest Level Control for an MMC-based LFAC system. Experimental results obtained with a 120-cell MMC prototype are presented to validate the effectiveness and operation of the MMC in LFAC applications.},

ABSTRACT = {Electrode roll forming involves rolling a battery electrode into a preset thickness using a hydraulic roll gap thickness automatic control system (hydraulic AGC for short). The pump-controlled AGC is a highly nonlinear servo system, which is a combination of mechanical, hydraulic and electronic control disciplines; thus, as a new technology, it still faces many challenges in the field of pole plate rolling. In this paper, electro-hydraulic servo pump-controlled AGC technology is replaced by electro-hydraulic servo valve-controlled AGC technology. With pump-controlled AGC high-precision thickness control as the research objective, the fuzzy control method is selected to deal with complex nonlinear systems based on pump-controlled AGC nonlinear stiffness characteristics and nonlinear transmission characteristics. A characteristic compensation control strategy is proposed. At the same time, considering the load fluctuation caused by the uneven thickness of the electrode plate under the intermittent coating rolling condition of a lithium battery, the fuzzy internal model (IMC) compensation control strategy was proposed to compensate the structural characteristics of the electrode plate rolling. Comparative experiments show that the position control accuracy of the pump-controlled AGC system can be improved significantly by using a fuzzy IMC compensation control strategy. The steady-state accuracy of the slope signal can reach ±0.7 μm, and the position-following accuracy of the sinusoidal signal can reach ±1.8 μm. In addition, this study will assist technological upgrades to lithium battery electrode roll forming and fixed-roll-gap rolling, laying a theoretical foundation for the promotion of pump control technology in the field of electrode rolling.},

ABSTRACT = {Total organic carbon (TOC) content is a key indicator for determining the hydrocarbon content of shale. The current model for calculating the TOC content of shale is relatively simplistic, the modeling process is cumbersome, and the parameters involved are influenced by subjective factors, which have certain shortcomings. To address this problem, a time-domain convolutional neural network (TCN) model for predicting total organic carbon content based on logging sequence information was established by starting from logging sequence information, conducting logging parameter sensitivity analysis experiments, prioritizing logging-sensitive parameters as model feature vectors, and constructing a TCN network. Meanwhile, to overcome the problem of an insufficient sample size, a five-fold cross-validation method was used to train the TCN model and obtain the weight matrix with the minimum error, and then a shale reservoir TOC content prediction model based on the TCN model was established. The model was applied to evaluate the TOC logging of the Lianggaoshan Formation in the Sichuan Basin, China, and the predicted results were compared with the traditional ΔlogR model. The results indicate that the TCN model predicts the TOC content more accurately than the traditional model, as demonstrated by laboratory tests. This leads to a better application effect. Additionally, the model fully explores the relationship between the logging curve and the total organic carbon content, resulting in improved accuracy of the shale TOC logging evaluation.},

ABSTRACT = {With the increasing scale of the power system, the increasing penetration of renewable energy, and the increasing uncertainty factors, traditional reliability evaluation methods based on Monte Carlo simulation have greatly reduced computational efficiency in complex power systems and cannot meet the requirements of real-time and rapid evaluation. This article proposes a hybrid data-driven strategy to achieve a rapid assessment of power grid reliability on two levels: offline training and online evaluation. Firstly, this article derives explicit analytical expressions for reliability indicators and component parameters, avoiding the computational burden of repetitive Monte Carlo simulation. Next, a large number of samples are quickly generated by parsing expressions to train convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and the system reliability index is quickly calculated under changing operating conditions through CNNs. Finally, the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed method are verified through an improved RTS-79 testing system. The calculation results show that the method proposed in this article can achieve an online solution of second-level reliability indicators while ensuring calculation accuracy.},

ABSTRACT = {There are many natural fractures in shale reservoirs, changes in hydraulic fracture extension patterns. In the paper, a multi-fracture extension finite element model for horizontal wells in shale reservoirs under the disturbance of natural fractures is established by combining the actual geological parameters and construction parameters of a horizontal well multi-fracturing operation in X oilfield to analyze the effects of the difference in geostress, elastic modulus, angle of natural fractures, and the number of natural fracture groups on the hydraulic fracture extension. The results show that with the increase in ground stress difference and natural fracture angle, hydraulic fractures are more likely to penetrate the natural fractures; with the increase in elastic modulus, the fracture stress and tip stress increase, the volume of rupture unit, the fracture extension width and the pore pressure concentration area decrease, and it is easy to form a long and narrow fracture; with the increase in the number of fracture groups, the connectivity of reservoir fractures increases, the extension of fractures is stronger, and it is easier to form a complex fracture network.},

ABSTRACT = {An integrated energy system (IES) breaks down barriers between different energy subsystems, enhancing energy reliability and efficiency. However, issues such as uneven equipment capacity allocation and suboptimal scheduling persist in multi-energy flow IES. To maximize economic benefits while ensuring energy balance and the operational characteristics of the equipment, a capacity matching optimization and scheduling strategy model for IES was developed. Firstly, mathematical models for the electricity, gas, and thermal networks within the IES were established. Secondly, considering the efficiency of energy conversion between different forms and constraints of energy storage in the electricity–thermal–gas interconnected energy system, optimization solutions were obtained using regional contraction algorithms and sequential quadratic programming methods. Finally, case studies conducted in a real park demonstrated that, through optimized capacity matching, unit prices for electricity, heat, and gas decreased by 39.9%, 90.5%, and 74.2%, respectively, effectively improving the economic viability of the system.},

ABSTRACT = {This study examines the connections between various fracture indicators and production data with an example from one of the giant fields in the Middle East producing complex fractured carbonate lithologies. The field under study hosts two reservoirs with a long development and production history, including carbonates from the Asmari and Bangestan Formations. A fracture intensity map was generated based on the interpretation of image logs from 28 wells drilled within the field. Mud loss data were collected and mapped based on the geostatistical Gaussian Random Function Simulation (GRFS) algorithm. Maximum curvature maps were generated based on Asmari structural surface maps. Comparing the results shows a good agreement between the curvature map, fault distribution model, mud loss map, fracture intensity map, and productivity index. The results of image log interpretations led to the identification of four classes of open fractures, including major open fractures, medium open fractures, minor open fractures, and hairline fractures. Using the azimuth and dip data of the four fracture sets mentioned above, the fracture intensity log was generated as a continuous log for each well with available image log data. For this purpose, the fracture intensity log and a continuous fracture network (CFN) model were generated. The continuous fracture network model was used to generate a 3D discrete fracture network (DFN) for the Asmari Formation. Finally, a 3D upscaled model of fracture dip and azimuth, fracture porosity, fracture permeability, fracture length, fracture aperture, and the sigma parameter (the connectivity index between matrix and fracture) were obtained. The results of this study can illuminate the modeling of intricate reservoirs and the associated production challenges, providing insights not only during the initial production phase but also in the application of advanced oil recovery methods, such as thermal recovery.},

ABSTRACT = {The production of tight gas wells decreases rapidly, and the traditional method is difficult to accurately predict the production of tight gas wells. At present, intelligent algorithms based on big data have been applied in oil and gas well production prediction, but there are still some technical problems. For example, the traditional error back propagation neural network (BP) still has the problem of finding the local optimal value, resulting in low prediction accuracy. In order to solve this problem, this paper establishes the output prediction method of BP neural network optimized with the sparrow search algorithm (SSA), and optimizes the hyperparameters of BP network such as activation function, training function, hidden layer, and node number based on examples, and constructs a high-precision SSA-BP neural network model. Data from 20 tight gas wells, the SSA-BP neural network model, Hongyuan model, and Arps model are predicted and compared. The results indicate that when the proportion of the predicted data is 20%, the SSA-BP model predicts an average absolute mean percentage error of 20.16%. When the proportion of forecast data is 10% of the total data, the SSA-BP algorithm has high accuracy and high stability. When the proportion of predicted data is 10%, the mean absolute average percentage error is 3.97%, which provides a new method for tight gas well productivity prediction.},
