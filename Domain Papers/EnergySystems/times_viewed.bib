ABSTRACT = {Shale gas production is associated with significant usage of fresh water and discharge of wastewater. Consequently, there is a necessity to create proper management strategies for water resources in shale gas production and to integrate conventional energy sources (e.g., shale gas) with renewables (e.g., solar energy). The objective of this study is to develop a design framework for integrating water and energy systems including multiple energy sources, the cogeneration process and desalination technologies in treating wastewater and providing fresh water for shale gas production. Solar energy is included to provide thermal power directly to a multi-effect distillation plant (MED) exclusively (to be more feasible economically) or indirect supply through a thermal energy storage system. Thus, MED is driven by direct or indirect solar energy and excess or direct cogeneration process heat. The proposed thermal energy storage along with the fossil fuel boiler will allow for the dual-purpose system to operate at steady-state by managing the dynamic variability of solar energy. Additionally, electric production is considered to supply a reverse osmosis plant (RO) without connecting to the local electric grid. A multi-period mixed integer nonlinear program (MINLP) is developed and applied to discretize the operation period to track the diurnal fluctuations of solar energy. The solution of the optimization program determines the optimal mix of solar energy, thermal storage and fossil fuel to attain the maximum annual profit of the entire system. A case study is solved for water treatment and energy management for Eagle Ford Basin in Texas.},

ABSTRACT = {The naphtha recovery unit (NRU) is an integral part of the processes used in the oil sands industry for bitumen extraction. The principle role of the NRU is to recover naphtha from the tailings for reuse in this process. This process is energy-intensive, and environmental guidelines for naphtha recovery must be met. Steady-state models for the NRU system are developed in this paper using two different approaches. The first approach is a statistical, data-based modelling approach where linear regression models have been developed using Minitab® from plant data collected during a performance test. The second approach involves the development of a first-principles model in Aspen Plus® based on the NRU process flow diagram. A novel refinement to this latter model, called “withdraw and remix”, is proposed based on comparing actual plant data to model predictions around the two units used to separate water and naphtha. The models developed in this paper suggest some interesting ideas for the further optimization of the process, in that it may be possible to achieve the required naphtha recovery using less energy. More plant tests are required to validate these ideas.},

ABSTRACT = {A dynamic model of a concentrating solar thermal array and thermal energy storage system is presented that is differentiable in the design decision variables: solar aperture area and thermal energy storage capacity. The model takes as input the geographic location of the system of interest and the corresponding discrete hourly solar insolation data, and calculates the annual thermal and economic performance of a particular design. The model is formulated for use in determining optimal hybridization strategies for industrial process heat applications using deterministic gradient-based optimization algorithms. Both convex and nonconvex problem formulations are presented. To demonstrate the practicability of the models, they were applied to four different case studies for three disparate geographic locations in the US. The corresponding optimal design problems were solved to global optimality using deterministic gradient-based optimization algorithms. The model and optimization-based analysis provide a rigorous quantitative design and investment decision-making framework for engineering design and project investment workflows.},

ABSTRACT = {The increasing variability in power plant load in response to a wildly uncertain electricity market and the need to to mitigate CO2 emissions, lead power plant operators to explore advanced options for efficiency optimization. Model-based, system-scale dynamic simulation and optimization are useful tools in this effort and are the subjects of the work presented here. In prior work, a dynamic model validated against steady-state data from a 605 MW subcritical power plant was presented. This power plant model was used as a test-bed for dynamic simulations, in which the coal load was regulated to satisfy a varying power demand. Plant-level control regulated the plant load to match an anticipated trajectory of the power demand. The efficiency of the power plant’s operation at varying loads was optimized through a supervisory control architecture that performs set point optimization on the regulatory controllers. Dynamic optimization problems were formulated to search for optimal time-varying input trajectories that satisfy operability and safety constraints during the transition between plant states. An improvement in time-averaged efficiency of up to 1.8% points was shown to be feasible with corresponding savings in coal consumption of 184.8 tons/day and a carbon footprint decrease of 0.035 kg/kWh.},

ABSTRACT = {The recent shale gas boom has transformed the energy landscape of the United States. Compared to natural gas, shale resources contain a substantial amount of condensate and natural gas liquids (NGLs). Many shale basin regions located in remote areas are lacking the infrastructure to distribute the extracted NGLs to other regions—particularly the Gulf Coast, a major gas processing region. Here we present a shale gas transformation process that converts NGLs in shale resources into liquid hydrocarbons, which are easier to transport from these remote basins than NGL or its constituents. This process involves catalytic dehydrogenation followed by catalytic oligomerization. Thermodynamic process analysis shows that this process has the potential to be more energy efficient than existing NGL-to-liquid fuel (NTL) technologies. In addition, our estimated payback period for this process is within the average lifetime of shale gas wells. The proposed process holds the promise to be an energy efficient and economically attractive step to valorize condensate in remote shale basins.},

ABSTRACT = {Supercritical carbon dioxide (S-CO2) Brayton cycles (BC) are soon to be a competitive and environment friendly power generation technology. Progressive technological developments in turbo-machineries and heat exchangers have boosted the idea of using S-CO2 in a closed-loop BC. This paper describes and discusses energy and exergy analysis of S-CO2 BC in cascade arrangement with a secondary cycle using CO2, R134a, ammonia, or argon as working fluids. Pressure drop in the cycle is considered, and its effect on the overall performance is investigated. No specific heat source is considered, thus any heat source capable of providing temperature in the range from 500 °C to 850 °C can be utilized, such as solar energy, gas turbine exhaust, nuclear waste heat, etc. The commercial software ‘Aspen HYSYS version 9’ (Aspen Technology, Inc., Bedford, MA, USA) is used for simulations. Comparisons with the literature and simulation results are discussed first for the standalone S-CO2 BC. Energy analysis is done for the combined cycle to inspect the parameters affecting the cycle performance. The second law efficiency is calculated, and exergy losses incurred in different components of the cycle are discussed.},

ABSTRACT = {Owing to the pollution free nature, higher efficiency and noise free operation, fuel cells have been identified as ideal energy sources for the future. To avoid direct storage of hydrogen due to safety considerations, storing hydrocarbon fuel such as methane and suitably reforming in situ for hydrogen production offers merit for further investigation. Separating the resulting hydrogen in the reformate using membrane separation can directly feed pure gas to the anode side of fuel cell for power generation. Despite the numerous works reported in literature on the dynamic and steady state modeling and analysis of reformers, membrane separation units and fuel cell systems, there has been limited work on an analysis of the integrated system consisting of all the three components. This study focuses on the mathematical modeling and analysis of the integrated reformer, membrane, fuel cell system from first principles in a dynamic framework. A multi loop control strategy is developed and implemented on the mathematical model of the integrated system in which appropriate controllers based on the system dynamics are designed to examine and study the overall closed loop performance to achieve rapidly fluctuating target power demand and rejection of reformer feed and fuel cell coolant temperature disturbances.},

ABSTRACT = {Natural gas liquefaction is an energy intensive process where the feed is cooled from ambient temperature down to cryogenic temperatures. Different liquefaction cycles exist depending on the application, with dual mixed refrigerant processes normally considered for the large-scale production of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG). Large temperature spans and small temperature differences in the heat exchangers make the liquefaction processes difficult to analyze. Exergetic losses from irreversible heat transfer increase exponentially with a decreasing temperature at subambient conditions. Consequently, an accurate and robust simulation tool is paramount to allow designers to make correct design decisions. However, conventional process simulators, such as Aspen Plus, suffer from significant drawbacks when modeling multistream heat exchangers. In particular, no rigorous checks exist to prevent temperature crossovers. Limited degrees of freedom and the inability to solve for stream variables other than outlet temperatures also makes such tools inflexible to use, often requiring the user to resort to a manual iterative procedure to obtain a feasible solution. In this article, a nonsmooth, multistream heat exchanger model is used to develop a simulation tool for two different dual mixed refrigerant processes. Case studies are presented for which Aspen Plus fails to obtain thermodynamically feasible solutions.},

ABSTRACT = {The market for the small-scale micro gas turbine is expected to grow rapidly in the coming years. Especially, utilization of commercial off-the-shelf components is rapidly reducing the cost of ownership and maintenance, which is paving the way for vast adoption of such units. However, to meet the high-reliability requirements of power generators, there is an acute need of a real-time monitoring system that will be able to detect faults and performance degradation, and thus allow preventive maintenance of these units to decrease downtime. In this paper, a micro gas turbine based combined heat and power system is modelled and used for development of physics-based diagnostic approaches. Different diagnostic schemes for performance monitoring of micro gas turbines are investigated.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper we propose a methodology to study circular economy processes based on mathematical modelling. In open-ended systems, waste could be converted back to recycling, transforming the economy from linear to circular. The concept of entropy and the second law of thermodynamics give the argument for a scale reduction of material circulation. As humans extract more and more energy and matter for the economy, the degree of entropy is likely to increase. Based on the findings of economic studies on the implications of industrialization in the case of growing economies, this study aims at evaluating circular economy processes at the European Union (EU) level using a Shannon-Entropy-based algorithm. An entropy-based analysis was conducted for the 28 European Union countries during the time frame 2007–2016. The modelling process consists of constructing a composite indicator which is composed of a weighted sum of all indicators developed by an algorithm based on Shannon Entropy. The weights assigned to each indicator in our analysis measure the significance of each indicator involved in the development of the composite indicator. The results are similar to the international rakings, consolidating and confirming the accuracy and reliability of this approach.},

ABSTRACT = {Traditional energy production plants are increasingly forced to cycle their load and operate under low-load conditions in response to growth in intermittent renewable generation. A plant-wide dynamic model of a supercritical pulverized coal (SCPC) power plant has been developed in the Aspen Plus Dynamics® (APD) software environment and the impact of advanced control strategies on the transient responses of the key variables to load-following operation and disturbances can be studied. Models of various key unit operations, such as the steam turbine, are developed in Aspen Custom Modeler® (ACM) and integrated in the APD environment. A coordinated control system (CCS) is developed above the regulatory control layer. Three control configurations are evaluated for the control of the main steam; the reheat steam temperature is also controlled. For studying servo control performance of the CCS, the load is decreased from 100% to 40% at a ramp rate of 3% load per min. The impact of a disturbance due to a change in the coal feed composition is also studied. The CCS is found to yield satisfactory performance for both servo control and disturbance rejection.},

ABSTRACT = {The attempt to reduce the environmental impact of the petroleum sector has been the driver for researching energy efficient solutions to supply energy offshore. An attractive option is to develop innovative energy systems including renewable and conventional sources. The paper investigates the possibility to integrate a wind farm into an offshore combined cycle power plant. The design of such an energy system is a complex task as many, possibly conflicting, requirements have to be satisfied. The large variability of operating conditions due to the intermittent nature of wind and to the different stages of exploitation of an oil field makes it challenging to identify the optimal parameters of the combined cycle and the optimal size of the wind farm. To deal with the issue, an optimisation procedure was developed that was able to consider the performance of the system at a number of relevant off-design conditions in the definition of the optimal design. A surrogate modelling technique was applied in order to reduce the computational effort that would otherwise make the optimisation process unfeasible. The developed method was applied to a case study and the resulting optimal designs were assessed and compared to other concepts, with or without wind power integration. The proposed offshore power plant returned the best environmental performance, as it was able to significantly cut the total carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in comparison to all the other concepts evaluated. The economic analysis showed the difficulty to repay the additional investment for a wind farm and the necessity of favourable conditions, in terms of gas and carbon dioxide (CO2) prices.},

ABSTRACT = {The penetration of renewable power generation is increasing at an unprecedented pace. While the operating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of photovoltaic (PV) and wind power are negligible, their upstream emissions are not. The great challenge with the deployment of renewable power generators is their intermittent and variable nature. Current electric power systems balance these fluctuations primarily using natural gas fired power plants. Alternatively, these dynamics could be handled by the integration of energy storage technologies to store energy during renewable energy availability and discharge when needed. In this paper, we present a model for estimating emissions from integrated power generation and energy storage. The model applies to emissions of all pollutants, including greenhouse gases (GHGs), and to all storage technologies, including pumped hydroelectric and electrochemical storage. As a case study, the model is used to estimate the GHG emissions of electricity from systems that couple photovoltaic and wind generation with lithium-ion batteries (LBs) and vanadium redox flow batteries (VFBs). To facilitate the case study, we conducted a life cycle assessment (LCA) of photovoltaic (PV) power, as well as a synthesis of existing wind power LCAs. The PV LCA is also used to estimate the emissions impact of a common PV practice that has not been comprehensively analyzed by LCA—solar tracking. The case study of renewables and battery storage indicates that PV and wind power remain much less carbon intensive than fossil-based generation, even when coupled with large amounts of LBs or VFBs. Even the most carbon intensive renewable power analyzed still emits only ~25% of the GHGs of the least carbon intensive mainstream fossil power. Lastly, we find that the pathway to minimize the GHG emissions of power from a coupled system depends upon the generator. Given low-emission generation (<50 gCO2e/kWh), the minimizing pathway is the storage technology with lowest production emissions (VFBs over LBs for our case study). Given high-emission generation (>200 gCO2e/kWh), the minimizing pathway is the storage technology with highest round-trip efficiency (LBs over VFBs).},

ABSTRACT = {Trailing oil is the tail section of contamination in oil pipelines. It is generated in batch transportation, for which one fluid, such as diesel oil follows another fluid, such as gasoline, and it has an effect on the quality of oil. This paper describes our analysis of the formation mechanism of trailing oil in pipelines and our study of the influence of dead-legs on the formation of trailing oil. We found that the oil replacement rate in a dead-leg is exponentially related to the flow speed, and the length of the dead-leg is exponentially related to the replacement time of the oil. To reduce the amount of mixed oil, the main flow speed should be kept at about 1.6 m/s, and the length of the dead-leg should be less than five times the diameter of the main pipe. In our work, the Reynolds time-averaged method is used to simulate turbulence. To obtain contamination-related experimental data, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software is used to simulate different flow rates and bypass lengths. MATLAB software was used to perform multi-nonlinear regression for the oil substitution time, the length of the bypass, and the flow speed. We determined an equation for calculating the length of the trailing oil contamination produced by the dead-leg. A modified equation for calculating the length of the contamination was obtained by combining the existing equation for calculating the length of the contamination with new factors based on our work. The amounts of contamination predicted by the new equation is closer to the actual contamination amounts than predicted values from other methods suggested by previous scholars.},

ABSTRACT = {The available energy can be effectively upgraded by adopting smart energy conversion measures. The biodegradability of biomass can be improved by employing pretreatment techniques; however, such methods result in reduced energy efficiency. In this study, microwave (MW) irradiation is used for green algae (Enteromorpha) pretreatment in combination with iron oxide nanoparticles (NPs) which act as a heterogeneous catalyst during anaerobic digestion process for biogas enhancement. Batch-wise anaerobic digestion was carried out. The results showed that MW pretreatment and its combination with Fe3O4 NPs produced highest yields of biogas and hydrogen as compared to the individual ones and control. The biogas amount and hydrogen % v/v achieved by MW pretreatment + Fe3O4 NPs group were 328 mL and 51.5%, respectively. The energy analysis indicated that synergistic application of MW pretreatment with Fe3O4 NPs produced added energy while consuming less input energy than MW pretreatment alone. The kinetic parameters of the reaction were scientifically evaluated by using modified Gompertz and Logistic function model for each experimental case. MW pretreatment + Fe3O4 NPs group improved biogas production potential and maximum biogas production rate.},

The thermal balance in the reactor (cavity and tubes) has been also solved by the CFD model, showing a 7.9% thermal efficiency of the reactor. CFD results also show the percentage of reacting media inside the tubes which achieve the required temperature for the endothermic reaction process, with 90% of the ferrite pellets inside the tubes above the required temperature of 900 °C.

ABSTRACT = {The electrification of the petrochemical industry, imposed by the urgent need for decarbonization and driven by the incessant growth of renewable electricity share, necessitates electricity-driven technologies for efficient conversion of fossil fuels to chemicals. Non-thermal plasma reactor systems that successfully perform in lab scale are investigated for this purpose. However, the feasibility of such electrified processes at industrial scale is still questionable. In this context, two process alternatives for ethylene production via plasma-assisted non-oxidative methane coupling have conceptually been designed based on previous work of our group namely, a direct plasma-assisted methane-to-ethylene process (one-step process) and a hybrid plasma-catalytic methane-to-ethylene process (two-step process). Both processes are simulated in the Aspen Plus V10 process simulator and also consider the technical limitations of a real industrial environment. The economically favorable operating window (range of operating conditions at which the target product purity is met at minimum utility cost) is defined via sensitivity analysis. Preliminary results reveal that the hybrid plasma-catalytic process requires 21% less electricity than the direct one, while the electric power consumed for the plasma-assisted reaction is the major cost driver in both processes, accounting for ~75% of the total electric power demand. Finally, plasma-assisted processes are not economically viable at present. However, future decrease in electricity prices due to renewable electricity production increase can radically affect process economics. Given that a break-even electricity price of 35 USD/MWh (without considering the capital cost) is calculated for the two-step plasma process and that current electricity prices for some energy intensive industries in certain countries can be as low as 50 USD/MWh, the plasma-assisted processes may become economically viable in the future.},

ABSTRACT = {With the rapid increase in production of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and environmental issues arising around the world, cathode materials, as the key component of all LIBs, especially need to be environmentally sustainable. However, a variety of life cycle assessment (LCA) methods increase the difficulty of environmental sustainability assessment. Three authoritative LCAs, IMPACT 2002+, Eco-indicator 99(EI-99), and ReCiPe, are used to assess three traditional marketization cathode materials, compared with a new cathode model, FeF3(H2O)3/C. They all show that four cathode models are ranked by a descending sequence of environmental sustainable potential: FeF3(H2O)3/C, LiFe0.98Mn0.02PO4/C, LiFePO4/C, and LiCoO2/C in total values. Human health is a common issue regarding these four cathode materials. Lithium is the main contributor to the environmental impact of the latter three cathode materials. At the midpoint level in different LCAs, the toxicity and land issues for LiCoO2/C, the non-renewable resource consumption for LiFePO4/C, the metal resource consumption for LiFe0.98Mn0.02PO4/C, and the mineral refinement for FeF3(H2O)3/C show relatively low environmental sustainability. Three LCAs have little influence on total endpoint and element contribution values. However, at the midpoint level, the indicator with the lowest environmental sustainability for the same cathode materials is different in different methodologies.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper proposes a microelectric power grid that includes wind and fuel cell power generation units, as well as a water electrolyzer for producing hydrogen gas. The grid is loaded by an induction motor (IM) as a dynamic load and constant impedance load. An optimal control algorithm using the Mine Blast Algorithm (MBA) is designed to improve the performance of the proposed renewable energy system. Normally, wind power is adapted to feed the loads at normal circumstances. Nevertheless, the fuel cell compensates extra load power demand. An optimal controller is applied to regulate the load voltage and frequency of the main power inverter. Also, optimal vector control is applied to the IM speed control. The response of the microgrid with the proposed optimal control is obtained under step variation in wind speed, load impedance, IM rotor speed, and motor mechanical load torque. The simulation results indicate that the proposed renewable generation system supplies the system loads perfectly and keeps up the desired load demand. Furthermore, the IM speed performance is acceptable under turbulent wind speed.},

ABSTRACT = {The objective of this paper is to evaluate and to simulate the cogeneration process applied to an apartment building in the Polanco area (Mexico). Considering the building’s electric, thermal demand and consumption data, the cogeneration process model was simulated using Thermoflow© software (Thermoflow Inc., Jacksonville, FL, USA), in order to cover 1.1 MW of electric demand and to supply the thermal needs of hot water, heating, air conditioning and heating pool. As a result of analyzing various schemes of cogeneration, the most efficient scheme consists of the use of a gas turbine (Siemens model SGT-100-1S), achieving a cycle with efficiency of 84.4% and a heat rate of 14,901 kJ/kWh. The economic results of this evaluation show that it is possible to implement the cogeneration in the building with a natural gas price below US$0.014/kWh. The use of financing schemes makes the economic results more attractive. Furthermore, the percentage of the turbine load effect on the turbine load net power, cogeneration efficiency, chimney flue gas temperature, CO2 emission, net heat ratio, turbine fuel flow and after burner fuel flow was also studied.},

ABSTRACT = {The use of hydrogen gas as a means of decoupling supply from demand is crucial for the transition to carbon-neutral energy sources and a greener, more distributed energy landscape. This work shows how simple commercially available titanium nitride coatings can be used to extend the lifetime of 316 grade stainless-steel electrodes for use as the cathode in an alkaline electrolysis cell. The material was subjected to accelerated ageing, with the specific aim of assessing the coating’s suitability for use with intermittent renewable energy sources. Over 2000 cycles lasting 5.5 days, an electrolytic cell featuring the coating outperformed a control cell by 250 mV, and a reduction of overpotential at the cathode of 400 mV was observed. This work also confirms that the coating is solely suitable for cathodic use and presents an analysis of the surface changes that occur if it is used anodically.},

ABSTRACT = {Binary cycle experiment as one of the Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) technologies has been known to provide an improved alternate scenario to utilize waste energy with low temperatures. As such, a binary geothermal power plant simulator was developed to demonstrate the geothermal energy potential in Dieng, Indonesia. To better understand the geothermal potential, the laboratory experiment to study the ORC heat source mechanism that can be set to operate at fixed temperatures of 110 °C and 120 °C is conducted. For further performance analysis, R245fa, R123, and mixed ratio working fluids with mass flow rate varied from 0.1 kg/s to 0.2 kg/s were introduced as key parameters in the study. Data from the simulator were measured and analyzed under steady-state condition with a 20 min interval per given mass flow rate. Results indicate that the ORC system has better thermodynamic performance when operating the heat source at 120 °C than those obtained from 110 °C. Moreover, the R123 fluid produces the highest ORC efficiency with values between 9.4% and 13.5%.},

ABSTRACT = {Pakistan has long relied on fossil fuels for electricity generation. This is despite the fact that the country is blessed with enormous renewable energy (RE) resources, which can significantly diversify the fuel mix for electricity generation. In this study, various renewable resources of Pakistan—solar, hydro, biomass, wind, and geothermal energy—are analyzed by using an integrated Delphi-analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and fuzzy technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (F-TOPSIS)-based methodology. In the first phase, the Delphi method was employed to define and select the most important criteria for the selection of RE resources. This process identified four main criteria, i.e., economic, environmental, technical, and socio-political aspects, which are further supplemented by 20 sub-criteria. AHP is later used to obtain the weights of each criterion and the sub-criteria of the decision model. The results of this study reveal wind energy as the most feasible RE resource for electricity generation followed by hydropower, solar, biomass, and geothermal energy. The sensitivity analysis of the decision model results shows that the results of this study are significant, reliable, and robust. The study provides important insights related to the prioritizing of RE resources for electricity generation and can be used to undertake policy decisions toward sustainable energy planning in Pakistan.},

ABSTRACT = {The best pricing method for any company in a perfectly competitive market is the pricing scheme with regards to the marginal cost. In contrast to this environment, there is a market with imperfect competition. In this market, the price can be affected by some players in the generation/demand side (i.e., suppliers and/or buyers). In the economic literature, “market power” refers to a company that has the power to affect prices. In fact, market power is often defined as the ability to divert prices from competitive levels. In the electricity market, especially because of the integration of intermittent renewable energy resources (RESs) along with the inflexibility of demand, there are levels of market power on the supply side. Hence, implementation of demand response (DR) programs is necessary to increase the flexibility of the demand side to deal with the intermittency of renewable generations and at the same time tackle the market power of the supply side. This paper uses economic theories and mathematical formulations to develop a flexible responsive load economic model (FRLEM) based on real-time pricing (RTP) to show modification of the load profile and mitigation of the energy costs for an industrial zone. This model was developed based on constant elasticity of the substitution utility function, known as one of the most popular utility functions in microeconomics.},

ABSTRACT = {The continuous increase in the number of stringent exhaust emission legislations of marine Diesel engines had led to a decrease in NOx emissions at the required level. Selective catalyst reduction (SCR) is the most prominent and mature technology used to reduce NOx emissions. However, to obtain maximum NOx removal with minimum ammonia slip remains a challenge. Therefore, new mixers are designed in order to obtain the maximum SCR efficiency. This paper reports performance parameters such as uniformity of velocity, ammonia uniformity distribution, and temperature distribution. Also, a numerical model is developed to investigate the interaction of urea droplet with exhaust gas and its effects by using line (LM) and swirl (SM) type mixers alone and in combination (LSM). The urea droplet residence time and its interaction in straight pipe are also investigated. Model calculations proved the improvement in velocity uniformity, distribution of ammonia uniformity, and temperature distribution for LSM. Prominent enhancement in the evaporation rate was also achieved by using LSM, which may be due to the breaking of urea droplets into droplets of smaller diameter. Therefore, the SCR system accomplished higher urea conversion efficiency by using LSM. Lastly, the ISO 8178 standard engine test cycle E3 was used to verify the simulation results. It has been observed that the average weighted value of NOx emission obtained at SCR outlet using LSM was 2.44 g/kWh, which strongly meets International Maritime Organization (IMO) Tier III NOx (3.4 g/kWh) emission regulations.},

ABSTRACT = {In this study, we developed a new hybrid mathematical model that combines wind-speed range with the log law to derive the wind energy potential for wind-generated hydrogen production in Pakistan. In addition, we electrolyzed wind-generated power in order to assess the generation capacity of wind-generated renewable hydrogen. The advantage of the Weibull model is that it more accurately reflects power generation potential (i.e., the capacity factor). When applied to selected sites, we have found commercially viable hydrogen production capacity in all locations. All sites considered had the potential to produce an excess amount of wind-generated renewable hydrogen. If the total national capacity of wind-generated was used, Pakistan could conceivably produce 51,917,000.39 kg per day of renewable hydrogen. Based on our results, we suggest that cars and other forms of transport could be fueled with hydrogen to conserve oil and gas resources, which can reduce the energy shortfall and contribute to the fight against climate change and global warming. Also, hydrogen could be used to supplement urban energy needs (e.g., for Sindh province Pakistan), again reducing energy shortage effects and supporting green city programs.},

ABSTRACT = {Electricity demand in Pakistan has consistently increased in the past two decades. However, this demand is so far partially met due to insufficient supply, inefficient power plants, high transmission and distribution system losses, lack of effective planning efforts and due coordination. The existing electricity generation also largely depends on the imported fossil fuels, which is a huge burden on the national economy alongside causing colossal loss to the environment. It is also evident from existing government plans that electricity generation from low-cost coal fuels in the near future will further increase the emissions. As such, in this study, following the government’s electricity demand forecast, four supply side scenarios for the study period (2013–2035) have been developed using Long-range Energy Alternatives Planning System (LEAP) software tool. These scenarios are Reference scenario (REF) based on the government’s power expansion plans, and three alternative scenarios, which include, More Renewable (MRR), More Hydro (MRH), and More Hydro Nuclear (MRHN). Furthermore, the associated gaseous emissions (CO2, SO2, NOX, CH4, N2O) are projected under each of these scenarios. The results of this study reveal that the alternative scenarios are more environmentally friendly than the REF scenario where penetration of planned coal-based power generation plants would be the major sources of emissions. It is, therefore, recommended that the government, apart from implementing the existing plans, should consider harnessing the renewable energy sources as indispensable energy sources in the future energy mix for electricity generation to reduce the fossil-fuel import bill and to contain the emissions.},

ABSTRACT = {Double-suction centrifugal pumps are widely used in industrial and agricultural applications since their flow rate is twice that of single-suction pumps with the same impeller diameter. They usually run for longer, which makes them susceptible to cavitation, putting the downstream components at risk. A fast approach to predicting the Net Positive Suction Head required was applied to perform a multi-objective optimization on the double-suction centrifugal pump. An L32 (84) orthogonal array was designed to evaluate 8 geometrical parameters at 4 levels each. A two-layer feedforward neural network and genetic algorithm was applied to solve the multi-objective problem into pareto solutions. The results were validated by numerical simulation and compared to the original design. The suction performance was improved by 7.26%, 3.9%, 4.5% and 3.8% at flow conditions 0.6Qd, 0.8Qd, 1.0Qd and 1.2Qd respectively. The efficiency increased by 1.53% 1.0Qd and 1.1% at 0.8Qd. The streamline on the blade surface was improved and the vapor volume fraction of the optimized impeller was much smaller than that of the original impeller. This study established a fast approach to cavitation optimization and a parametric database for both hub and shroud blade angles for double suction centrifugal pump optimization design.},

ABSTRACT = {Waste cooking oils (WCO) recycling companies usually have economic losses for buying WCO not suitable for biodiesel production, e.g., WCO with high free acidity (FA). For this reason, the determination of FA of WCO by near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy was studied in this work to assess its potential for in situ application. To do this, FA of 45 WCO was measured by the classical titration method, which ranged between 0.15 and 3.77%. Then, the NIR spectra from 800 to 2200 nm of these WCO were acquired, and a partial least squares model was built, relating the NIR spectra to FA values. The accuracy of the model was quite high, providing r2 of 0.970 and a ratio of performance to deviation (RPD) of 4.05. Subsequently, a model using an NIR range similar to that provided by portable NIR spectrometers (950–1650 nm) was built. The performance was lower (r2 = 0.905; RPD = 2.66), but even so, with good accuracy, which demonstrates the potential of NIR spectroscopy for the in situ determination of FA of WCO.},

ABSTRACT = {The off-grid solar photovoltaic (PV) system is a significant step towards electrification in the remote rural regions, and it is the most convenient and easy to install technology. However, the strategic problem is in identifying the potential of solar energy and the economic viability in particular regions. This study, therefore, addresses this problem by evaluating the solar energy potential and economic viability for the remote rural regions of the Sindh province, Pakistan. The results recommended that the rural regions of Sindh have suitable solar irradiance to generate electricity. An appropriate tilt angle has been computed for the selected rural regions, which significantly enhances the generation capacity of solar energy. Moreover, economic viability has been undertaken in this study and it was revealed that the off-grid solar PV power generation system provides electricity at the cost of Pakistani Rupees (PKR) 6.87/kWh and is regarded as much cheaper than conventional energy sources, i.e., around PKR 20.79/kWh. Besides, the off-grid solar PV power generation system could mitigate maximum CO2 annually on the condition that all of the selected remote rural regions adopt the off-grid solar PV system. Therefore, this study shall help the government to utilize the off-grid solar PV power generation system in the remote rural regions of Pakistan.},

ABSTRACT = {When assessing energy efficiency, most studies have frequently ignored environmental aspects even though the concept has been widely used in the past. This study evaluates the energy efficiency and environmental performance of South Asia by using DEA (data envelopment analysis) like mathematical composite indicator. We construct a comprehensive set of indicators, including an energy self-sufficiency ratio, energy production over consumption ratio, energy imports, diversification index of energy imports, energy reserve ratio, GDP productivity, energy intensity, per capita energy consumption index, carbon emission index, carbon emission index per unit of energy consumption and share of renewable energy in order to develop an energy efficiency and environmental performance index. Unlike other studies, this study first examines each indicator and then estimates a combined score for each country. The results reveal that Bhutan as a more secure country and Pakistan showed a decreasing trend, while Sri Lanka and India performed satisfactorily. Remarkably, Bangladesh, Nepal and Afghanistan showed a decreasing trend. This study proposes a policy that increases the cross-border trade of renewable energy for long term energy efficiency and environmental performance.},

ABSTRACT = {Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) is an effective method to optimize energy consumption patterns. Since the concept of NILM was proposed, extensive research has focused on energy disaggregation or load identification. The traditional method is to disaggregate mixed signals, and then identify the independent load. This paper proposes a multi-label classification method using Random Forest (RF) as a learning algorithm for non-intrusive load identification. Multi-label classification can be used to determine which categories data belong to. This classification can help to identify the operation states of independent loads from mixed signals without disaggregation. The experiments are conducted in real environment and public data set respectively. Several basic electrical features are selected as the classification feature to build the classification model. These features are also compared to select the most suitable features for classification by feature importance parameters. The classification accuracy and F-score of the proposed method can reach 0.97 and 0.98, respectively.},

ABSTRACT = {In addition to its potential for wave power, wind power, hydropower, and solar power, it can be said that Vietnam is a country with great potential for biomass energy derived from agricultural waste, garbage, and urban wastewater, which are resources widely available across the country. This huge amount of biomass, however, if left untreated, could become a major source of pollution and cause serious impacts on ecosystems (soil, water, and air), as well as on human health. In this research, the authors present a fuzzy multicriteria decision-making model (FMCDM) for optimizing the site selection process for biomass power plants. All of the criteria affecting location selection are identified by experts and literature reviews; in addition, the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) method was utilized so as to identify the weight of all of the criteria in the second stage. Furthermore, the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) is applied for ranking potential locations in the final stage of this research. As a result, Long An (DMU/005) was found to be the best location for building biomass energy in Vietnam. The main contributions of this work include modeling the site selection decision process under fuzzy environment conditions. The proposed approaches also can address the complex problems in site selection; it is also a flexible design model for considering the evaluation criteria, and is applicable to location selection for other industries.},

ABSTRACT = {Solvent-based post-combustion carbon capture (PCC) is a mature and essential technology to solve the global warming problem. The high energy consuming issue and the flexible operation required by the power plants inquire about the development of effective control systems for PCC plants. This study proposes the optimal-based control approach that utilizes optimal set-point values for the quality controllers. The five optimal-based control schemes studied all employed L/G (liquid to gas ratio in absorber) as one quality control variable. Performance comparisons with a typical conventional control scheme are conducted employing a rate-based dynamic model for the MEA (monoethanolamine) solvent PCC process developed on a commercial process simulator. Compared to the typical control scheme, the optimal-based control schemes provide faster responses to the disturbance changes from the flue gas conditions and the set-point change of the CO2 capture efficiency, as well as better results in terms of IAEs (integral of absolute errors) of capture efficiency and reboiler heat duty during the stabilization period. LG-Tstr and LG-Tabs-Cascade are the best schemes. In addition to L/G, these two schemes employ the control of Tstr (the temperature of a stage of stripper) and a cascade control of Tabs (the temperature of a stage of absorber) (outer loop) and Tstr (inner loop), respectively.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper presents a statistical analysis of wind speed data that can be extremely useful for installing a wind generation as a stand-alone system. The main objective is to define the wind power capacity’s contribution to the adequacy of generation systems for the purpose of selecting wind farm locations at specific sites in Malaysia. The combined Sequential Monte Carlo simulation (SMCS) technique and the Weibull distribution models are employed to demonstrate the impact of wind power in power system reliability. To study this, the Roy Billinton Test System (RBTS) is considered and tested using wind data from two sites in Peninsular Malaysia, Mersing and Kuala Terengganu, and one site, Kudat, in Sabah. The results showed that Mersing and Kudat were best suitable for wind sites. In addition, the reliability indices are compared prior to the addition of the two wind farms to the considered RBTS system. The results reveal that the reliability indices are slightly improved for the RBTS system with wind power generation from both the potential sites.},

ABSTRACT = {The widespread penetration of hydrogen in mainstream energy systems requires hydrogen production processes to be economically competent and environmentally efficient. Hydrogen, if produced efficiently, can play a pivotal role in decarbonizing the global energy systems. Therefore, this study develops a framework which evaluates hydrogen production processes and quantifies deficiencies for improvement. The framework integrates slack-based data envelopment analysis (DEA), with fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (FAHP) and fuzzy technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (FTOPSIS). The proposed framework is applied to prioritize the most efficient and sustainable hydrogen production in Pakistan. Eleven hydrogen production alternatives were analyzed under five criteria, including capital cost, feedstock cost, O&M cost, hydrogen production, and CO2 emission. FAHP obtained the initial weights of criteria while FTOPSIS determined the ultimate weights of criteria for each alternative. Finally, slack-based DEA computed the efficiency of alternatives. Among the 11, three alternatives (wind electrolysis, PV electrolysis, and biomass gasification) were found to be fully efficient and therefore can be considered as sustainable options for hydrogen production in Pakistan. The rest of the eight alternatives achieved poor efficiency scores and thus are not recommended.},

ABSTRACT = {Understanding the dynamic nexus between CO2 emissions and economic growth in the sustainable environment helps the economies in developing resources and formulating apposite energy policies. In the recent past, various studies have explored the nexus between CO2 emissions and economic growth. This study, however, investigates the nexus between renewable energy production, CO2 emissions, and economic growth over the period from 1995 to 2016 for seven Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries. Fully Modified Ordinary Least Square (FMOLS) and Dynamic Ordinary Least Square (DOLS) methodologies were used to estimate the long- and short-run relationships. The panel results revealed that renewable energy production has a significant long term effect on CO2 emissions for Vietnam (t = −2.990), Thailand (t = −2.505), and Indonesia (t = −2.515), and economic growth impact for Malaysia (t = 2.050), Thailand (t = −2.001), and the Philippines (t = −2.710). It is, therefore, vital that the ASEAN countries implement policies and strategies that ensure energy saving and continuous economic growth without forsaking the environment. This study, as such, recommends that ASEAN countries should take measures to decrease the reliance on fossil fuels for achieving these objectives. Future research should consider the principles of circular economy and clean energy development mechanisms integrated with renewable energy technologies.},

ABSTRACT = {The temperature of a PV (photovoltaic) panel increases when it produces electricity but its electrical efficiency decreases when the temperature increases. In addition, the electrical efficiency of the PV panel is very limited. To increase the PV efficiency, the rest of the solar irradiance must be used, together with the temperature being kept at an optimum value. With this purpose, an experimental study was conducted. Firstly, two specific photovoltaic-thermal (PV/T) systems were designed. The first was the PV/T system which used only a water heat exchanger. The other one was the PV/T system that used a water and air heat exchanger. In the latter PV/T system, air passed through both the top of the PV panel and the bottom of it while water passed through only the bottom of the panel in a separate heat exchanger. In this way, the water and air absorbed the thermal energy of the panel by means of separate heat exchangers, simultaneously. In addition to the two systems mentioned above, an uncooled photovoltaic module was also designed in order to compare the systems. As a result, three different modules were designed. This study was conducted in a natural ambient environment and on days which had different climatic conditions. The thermal, electrical and overall efficiencies of each PV/T module were determined. The results were compared with the uncooled module electrical efficiency. The results showed that when water and air were used together, it was more efficient than single usage in a PV/T system. The thermal gain of the working fluids was also found to be fairly high and so, the gained energy could be used for different purposes. For example, hot air could be used in drying systems and air condition systems. Hot water could be used in hot water supply systems.},

ABSTRACT = {The open-source software OpenFOAM 5.0 was used as a platform to perform steady-state and transient numerical simulation for full flow field of a pipeline centrifugal pump (specific speed ns = 65) in a wide operating capacity range of 0.3Qd~1.4Qd. The standard k-ε and k-ω SST (Shear-Stress Transport) turbulence models were selected in the flow governing equations. The simpleFoam and pimpleDyMFoam solvers were used for the steady-state and transient calculations, respectively. ParaView, the postprocessor in OpenFOAM, was used to display the calculated flow velocity, pressure and streamline distributions, and to analyze the relationship between the vortex and the hydraulic loss in the pump. The external performance parameters of the pump such as head, input power and efficiency were also calculated based on the simulated flow fields. The predicted pump performances by OpenFOAM and Ansys-Fluent are compared with the test results under the same calculation model, grids and boundary conditions. The comparison indicates that OpenFOAM had high accuracy in the prediction of pump performance in the current case.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper focuses on total quality management (TQM) processes and their applications to increase the management performance of enterprises in the renewable energy sector (RES). TQM is a modern tool used by enterprises to increase their management performance. We start with a description of Edwards Deming’s conceptualized model, highlighting different phases of its development as described in the literature. The TQM process is then used for an application to the RES in Romania. The quantitative model analyzes the influence of TQM process implementation in achieving competitive advantage and the management performance of the undertakings in the RES. Data was collected through a survey based on a questionnaire addressed to employees and managers in the RES. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used and the research hypotheses were tested with the partial least squares path method (PLS). Data analysis was performed with the statistical software SmartPLS 3.2.8. The main contribution of this article is to evaluate the relationship between the management performance of enterprises in the RES sector in Romania and TQM process indicators. The results underline the fact that the most important attributes of a TQM process to increase the management performance are: integrated operational processes, policies and trading strategies, integrated operational management, company social responsibility, motivated workforce, knowledge, and competencies. The conclusions of the research are in line with the latest findings in the area, underlining that management performance is the direct result of the association between a group of factors and processes, such as the integrated operational processes, trade strategies and policies, integrated operational management, corporate social responsibility (CSR), motivated workforce, knowledge, and competencies.},

ABSTRACT = {A high specific speed centrifugal pump is used in the situation of large flow and low head. Centrifugal pump parameters need to be optimized in order to raise its head and efficiency under off-design conditions. In this study, the orthogonal experiment design method is adopted to optimize the performance of centrifugal pump basing on three parameters, namely, blade outlet width b2, blade outlet angle β2 and blade wrap angle φ. First, the three-dimensional model of the centrifugal pump is established by CFturbo and SolidWorks. Then nine different schemes are designed by using orthogonal table, and numerical simulation is carried out in CFX15.0. The final optimized combination of parameters is b2 = 24 mm, β2 = 24°, φ = 112°. Under the design condition, the head and efficiency of the optimized centrifugal pump are appropriately improved, the increments of which are 0.74 m and 0.48%, respectively. However, the efficiency considerably increases at high flow rates, with an increase of 6.9% at 1.5 Qd. The anti-cavitation performance of the optimized centrifugal pump is also better than the original pump. The results in this paper can provide references for parameter selection (b2, β2, φ) in the centrifugal pump design.},

ABSTRACT = {In this study, plate-fin heat sinks with partial heating under forced convection were experimentally investigated. The base temperature profiles of the plate-fin heat sinks were measured for various heating lengths, heating positions, flow rates, and channel widths. From the experimental data, the effects of heating length, heating position, and flow rate on the base temperature profile and the thermal performance were investigated. Finally, the characteristics of the optimal heating position were investigated. As a result, it was shown that the optimal heating position was on the upstream side in the case of the heat sinks under laminar developing flow, as opposed to the heat sinks under turbulent flow. It was also shown that the optimal heating position could change significantly due to heat losses through the front and back of the heat sink, while the effects of the heat loss through the sides of the heat sink on the optimal heating position were negligible. In addition, it was shown that the one-dimensional numerical model with empirical coefficients could predict the important trends in the measured temperature profiles, thermal resistances, and optimal heating lengths.},

ABSTRACT = {The commercial COCO simulation program was used to mimic the experimental slow pyrolysis process of five different biomasses based on thermodynamic consideration. The program generated the optimum set of reaction kinetic parameters and reaction stoichiometric numbers that best described the experimental yields of solid, liquid and gas products. It was found that the simulation scheme could predict the product yields over the temperature range from 300 to 800 °C with reasonable accuracy of less than 10% average error. An attempt was made to generalize the biomass pyrolysis behavior by dividing the five biomasses into two groups based on the single-peak and two-peak characteristics of the DTG (derivative thermogravimetry) curves. It was found that this approximate approach was able to predict the product yields reasonably well. The proposed simulation method was extended to the analysis of slow pyrolysis results derived from previous investigations. The results obtained showed that the prediction errors of product yields were relatively large, being 12.3%, 10.6%, and 27.5% for the solid, liquid, and gas products, respectively, possibly caused by differing pyrolysis conditions from those used in the simulation. The prediction of gas product compositions by the simulation program was reasonably satisfactory, but was less accurate for predicting the compositions of liquid products analyzed in forms of hydrocarbons, aromatics and oxygenated fractions. In addition, information on the kinetics of thermal decomposition of biomass in terms of the variation of fractional conversion with time was also derived as a function of temperature and biomass type.},

ABSTRACT = {A computational fluid dynamics software (DynamFluid) based on the application of the finite element method with the characteristic-based-split algorithm is presented and validated. The software is used to numerically integrate the steady and unsteady Navier–Stokes equations for both constant-density and Boussinesq non-isothermal flows. Benchmark two-dimensional computations carried out with DynamFluid show good agreement with previous results reported in the literature. Test cases used for validation include (i) the lid-driven cavity flow, (ii) mixed convection flow in a vertical channel with asymmetric wall temperatures, (iii) unsteady incompressible flow past a circular cylinder, and (iv) steady non-isothermal flow past a circular cylinder with negligible buoyancy effects. The new software is equipped with a graphical user interface that facilitates the definition of the fluid properties, the discretization of the physical domain, the definition of the boundary conditions, and the post-processing of the computed velocity, pressure and temperature fields.},

ABSTRACT = {As an important over-current component of the waterjet propulsion system, the main function of a nozzle is to transform the mechanical energy of the propulsion pump into the kinetic energy of the water and eject the water flow to obtain thrust. In this study, the nozzle with different geometry and parameters was simulated based on computational fluid dynamics simulation and experiment. Numerical results show a good agreement with experimental results. The results show that the nozzle with a circular shape outlet shrinks evenly. Under the designed flow rate condition, the velocity uniformity of the circular nozzle is 0.26% and 0.34% higher than that of the elliptical nozzle and the rounded rectangle nozzle, respectively. The pump efficiency of the circular nozzle is 0.31% and 0.14% higher than that of the others. The pressure recovery and hydraulic loss of the circular nozzle are superior. The hydraulic characteristics of the propulsion pump and waterjet propulsion system are optimal when the nozzle area is 30% times the outlet area of the inlet duct. Thus, the shaft power, head, thrust, and system efficiency of the propulsion pump and waterjet propulsion system are maximized. The system efficiency curve decreases rapidly when the outlet area exceeds 30% times the outlet area of the inlet duct. The transition curve forms greatly affect thrust and system efficiency. The transition of the linear contraction shows improved uniformity, and the hydraulic loss is reduced. Furthermore, the hydraulic performance of the nozzle with a linear contraction transition is better than that of others.},

ABSTRACT = {Renewed interest in freeze desalination has emerged due to its advantages over other desalination technologies. A major advantage of the freeze desalination process over evaporative methods is its lower energy consumption (latent heat of freezing is 333.5 kJ/kg and latent heat of evaporation is 2256.7 kJ/kg). Cryogenic fluids like LN2/LAir are emerging as an effective energy storage medium to maximise utilisation of intermittent renewable energy sources. The recovery of this stored cold energy has the potential to be used for freeze desalination. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modelling was developed to simulate the evaporation of liquid nitrogen to simultaneously conduct freeze desalination to investigate the feasibility of using cryogenic energy for freeze desalination. This integrated CFD model was validated using experimental heat exchanger test facility constructed, to evaporate liquid nitrogen to supply the cooling required for freezing. Parametric study on the LN2 flow rate to observe the volume of ice obtained was also examined using CFD, where increasing the velocity of LN2 by 6 times, increased the volume of ice obtained by 4.3 times. A number of freezing stages were required in order to reduce the ice salinity from 1.5% down to 0.1% as regarded by the World Health Organisation (WHO) as safe to drink. In the cryogenic desalination test rig, approximately 1.35 L of liquid nitrogen was required to reduce the ice salinity from 1.5% to less than 0.1%. Furthermore, the above results illustrate the potential of using the cold energy of cryogenic fluids such as Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) and LN2/LAir for freeze desalination applications as most cold energy during LNG regasification has been unexploited today.},

ABSTRACT = {The rising global warming concerns and explosive degradation of the environment requires the mainstream utilization of alternative fuels, such as hydroxy gas (HHO) which presents itself as a viable substitute for extracting the benefits of hydrogen. Therefore, an experimental study of the performance and emission characteristics of alternative fuels in contrast to conventional gasoline was undertaken. For experimentation, a spark ignition engine was run on a multitude of fuels comprising of gasoline, Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and hybrid blend of HHO with LPG. The engine was operated at 60% open throttle with engine speed ranging from 1600 rpm to 3400 rpm. Simultaneously, the corresponding performance parameters including brake specific fuel consumption, brake power and brake thermal efficiency were investigated. Emission levels of CO, CO2, HC and NOx were quantified in the specified speed range. To check the suitability of the acquired experimental data, it was subjected to a Weibull distribution fit. Enhanced performance efficiency and reduced emissions were observed with the combustion of the hybrid mixture of LPG with HHO in comparison to LPG: on average, brake power increased by 7% while the brake specific fuel consumption reduced by 15%. On the other hand, emissions relative to LPG decreased by 21%, 9% and 21.8% in cases of CO, CO2, and unburned hydrocarbons respectively. Incorporating alternative fuels would not only imply reduced dependency on conventional fuels but would also contribute to their sustainability for future generations. Simultaneously, the decrease in harmful environmental pollutants would help to mitigate and combat the threats of climate change.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper aims at studying the dynamic fluid evolution process of port plate pair of an axial piston pump. First of all, The Renormalization Group k-ε model (RNG k-ε model) is implemented to simulate the dynamic flow distribution and forecast the evolution of the internal vortex structure inside the valve plate chamber with different speeds of pistons and velocities of inlet fluid by using computational fluid dynamics software. Then, an equivalent amplification test model of a piston-valve plate is built up based on Reynolds similarity theory; the flow state of the piston-valve plate flow field is observed applied the particle image velocimetry (PIV) measuring technique. The resulting uniformity of numerical simulation and PIV measurement verifies that the RNG k-ε model can achieve high-precision prediction for the vortex structure inside the valve plate chamber. Through analysis of velocity contours and streamlines of the flow field, it can be found that vortices with different scales, strengths and positions will occur during the process of fluid distribution, and the scale and strength of the vortex inside the valve plate chamber will be reduced with the increase of the piston’s moving speed, so the energy loss is also reduced and the efficiency is improved.},

ABSTRACT = {Usage of a wide-angle diffuser may result in unfavorable separated flow and a significant diffuser loss. To improve the performance of the diffusers, inserting short splitter vanes is known as a useful method that has been demonstrated experimentally. Regarding the role of the vane in the diffuser flow, Senoo & Nishi (1977) qualitatively explained that the lift force acting on the vane should be a key factor. However, its quantitative verification remains since then. To challenge this issue, numerical simulations of incompressible flow in a wide angle of 28° two-dimensional diffuser with and without a short splitter vane were conducted in the present study. An improvement of pressure-recovery by the vane and oscillatory flows in the diffuser are reasonably reproduced from comparison with the experimental results made by Cochran & Kline (1958). It is also found that the lift force acting on the vane varies periodically in an opposite phase with the detachment point moved back and forth on a diverging wall, since one vane is not sufficient to fully suppress the flow separation that occurred on the wall and the incoming main-flow shifts toward the other diverging wall in the diffuser. Thus, as a role of splitter vane in the diffuser, “the lift force of the vane is a key factor” may be quantitatively verified from the present numerical simulation. Further, it is confirmed by the local loss analysis that the turbulent kinetic energy production observed in mixing layers contributes most of the loss in the diffuser. Consequently, the present numerical technique may be usable to investigate the flow character in a diffuser with splitter vanes at a design stage.},

ABSTRACT = {A solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) is an electrochemical cell that converts chemical energy into electrical energy by oxidizing fuel. SOFC has high efficiency and cleans oxidation residues. Research has shown the importance of SOFC control. Voltage output control is needed because of nonlinearity, slow dynamics, and proper SOFC operating restrictions. This study aims to design an SOFC simulator with output voltage control to optimize the flow rate of fuel (hydrogen) and air (oxygen). This SOFC simulator is designed based on a microcontroller model. The controller is designed using the fuzzy logic method. Tests show that the output voltage can approach the set point with an average of 340.6 volts. The pressure difference (∆Pressure) between the two gases averaged 4428 Pa, and the fuel/gas flow rate was in the range of 0.7 mol/s. The controller can correct both the output voltage of the SOFC simulator and the difference in gas pressure under 8106 Pa (0.08 atm).},

ABSTRACT = {CFD (computational fluid dynamics) simulation using a commercial package (Fluent-ANSYS) on industrial rotary kilns using annulus-type burners and methane gas was carried out to examine the characteristics of the flame length and flow visualization. New influencing design and operating parameters—primary air swirl number, primary air inlet annulus diameter, and secondary air temperature—were investigated and discussed. The influence of these parameters on axial temperature distribution, axial mean mixture fractions, velocity vectors, mixture fractions, and temperature contours were investigated. The current numerical findings were compared with existing experimental results to validate the simulation approach. The results showed that the primary air swirl number had a remarkable influence on the flame length at a lower primary air inlet annulus diameter ratio of 2.3. Moreover, the flame length increased by 20% and 6% with increasing the swirl number from zero to one for primary air inlet annulus diameter ratios of 2.3 and 5, respectively, and it also increased by 19% with increasing primary air inlet annulus diameter ratio from 2.3 to 5.},

ABSTRACT = {Ice cream viscosity is one of the properties that most changes during crystallization in scraped surface heat exchangers (SSHE), and its online measurement is not easy. Its estimation is necessary through variables that are easy to measure. The temperature and power of the stirring motor of the SSHE turn out to be this type of variable and are closely related to the viscosity. Therefore, a mathematical model based on these variables proved to be feasible. The development of this mathematical relationship involved the rheological study of the ice cream base, as well as the application of a method for its in situ melting in the rheometer as a function of the temperature, and the application of a mathematical model correlating the SSHE stirring power and the ice cream viscosity. The result was a coupled model based on both the temperature and stirring power of the SSHE, which allowed for online viscosity estimation with errors below 10% for crystallized systems with a 30% ice fraction at the exit of the SSHE. The model obtained is a first step in the search for control strategies for crystallization in SSHE.},

ABSTRACT = {Global warming is one of most severe environmental concerns that our planet is facing today. One of its causes is the previous generation of refrigerants that, upon release, remain in the atmosphere for longer periods and contribute towards global warming. This issue could potentially be solved by replacing the previous generation’s high global warming potential (GWP) refrigerants with environmentally friendly refrigerants. This scenario requires an analysis of new refrigerants for a comparison of the thermodynamic properties of the previously used refrigerants. In the present research, a numerical study was conducted to analyze the thermodynamic performance of specifically low GWP hydrofluoroolefens (HFO) refrigerants for an actual vapor compression refrigeration cycle (VCRC) with a constant degree of 3 K superheat. The output parameters included the refrigeration effect, compressor work input, the coefficient of performance (COP), and the volumetric refrigeration capacity (VRC), all of which were calculated by varying the condenser pressure from 6 to 12 bars and vapor pressure from 0.7 to 1.9 bars. Results showed that R1234ze(Z) clearly possessed the desired thermodynamic performance. The drop in refrigeration effect for R1234ze(Z) was merely 14.6% less than that of R134a at a 12 bar condenser pressure; this was minimum drop among candidate refrigerants. The drop in the COP was the minimum for R1234ze(Z)—5.1% less than that of R134a at a 9 bar condenser pressure and 4.7% less than that of R134a at a 1.9 bar evaporator pressure, whereas the COP values of the other refrigerants dropped more drastically at higher condenser pressures. R1234ze(Z) possessed favorable thermodynamic characteristics, with a GWP of 7, and it can serve as an alternative refrigerant for refrigeration systems for a sustainable environment.},

ABSTRACT = {A distributed variable model for solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC), with internal fuel reforming on the anode, has been developed in Aspen HYSYS. The proposed model accounts for the complex and interactive mechanisms involved in the SOFC operation through a mathematically viable and numerically fast modeling framework. The internal fuel reforming reaction calculations have been carried out in a plug flow reactor (PFR) module integrated with a spreadsheet module to interactively calculate the electrochemical process details. By interlinking the two modules within Aspen HYSYS flowsheeting environment, the highly nonlinear SOFC distributed profiles have been readily captured using empirical correlations and without the necessity of using an external coding platform, such as MATLAB or FORTRAN. Distributed variables including temperature, current density, and concentration profiles along the cell length, have been discussed for various reforming activity rates. Moreover, parametric estimation of anode oxidation risk and carbon formation potential against fuel reformation intensity have been demonstrated that contributes to the SOFC lifetime evaluation. Incrementally progressive catalyst activity has been proposed as a technically viable approach for attaining smooth profiles within the SOFC anode. The proposed modeling platform paves the way for SOFC system flowsheeting and optimization, particularly where the study of systems with stack distributed variables is of interest.},

ABSTRACT = {The cogeneration system of a sugar factory consists of boiler, steam turbine, and sugar juice evaporation process. The multiple-effect evaporator used for the conventional sugar juice evaporation process is the forward-feed multiple-effect evaporator, in which steam and sugar juice flow in the same direction. The main objective of this paper is to investigate the energy efficiency of the backward-feed multiple-effect evaporator, in which steam and sugar juice flow in opposite directions, compared with that of the forward-feed multiple-effect evaporator. Mathematical models are developed for both multiple-effect evaporators, and used to compare the performances of two cogeneration systems that use the forward-feed and backward-feed multiple-effect evaporators. The forward-feed multiple-effect evaporator requires extracted steam from a turbine at one pressure, whereas the backward-feed multiple-effect evaporator requires steam extraction at two pressures. Both evaporators have the same total heating surface area, process the same amount of sugar juice, and operate at the optimum conditions. It is shown that the cogeneration system that uses the backward-feed multiple-effect is more energy efficient than the cogeneration system that uses the forward-feed multiple-effect because it yields more power output for the same fuel consumption.},

ABSTRACT = {Modeling and optimization of a double-inlet pulse tube refrigerator (DIPTR) is very difficult due to its geometry and nature. The objective of this paper was to optimize-DIPTR through experiments with the cold heat exchanger (CHX) along the comparison of cooling load with experimental data using different boundary conditions. To predict its performance, a detailed two-dimensional DIPTR model was developed. A double-drop pulse pipe cooler was used for solving continuity, dynamic and power calculations. External conditions for applicable boundaries include sinusoidal pressure from an end of the tube from a user-defined function and constant temperature or limitations of thermal flux within the outer walls of exchanger walls under colder conditions. The results of the system’s cooling behavior were reported, along with the connection between the mass flow rates, heat distribution along pulse tube and cold-end pressure, the cooler load’s wall temp profile and cooler loads with varied boundary conditions i.e. opening of 20% double-inlet and 40-60% orifice valves, respectively. Different loading conditions of 1 and 5 W were applied on the CHX. At 150 K temperature of the cold-end heat exchanger, a maximum load of 3.7 W was achieved. The results also reveal a strong correlation between computational fluid dynamics modeling results and experimental results of the DIPTR.},

ABSTRACT = {Heating flame furnaces are the main type of furnaces used for heating and heat treatment of metal products in metallurgy and mechanical engineering. In the working chamber of a modern heating furnace, there should be neither high-temperature nor stagnation zones. One of the methods used to provide such combustion conditions is the application of distributed (volumetric) combustion. Owing to this method, heating quality is ensured by creating a uniform temperature field and equivalent heat exchange conditions, regardless of the placement of the charge in the working chamber of the furnace. In this work, we numerically study the volumetric combustion and influences of small- and large-scale recirculation ratios of furnace gases, the influence of temperature fluctuation on the regenerator nozzle, and the working parameters at the starting phase and reverse.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper explores a possible waste-based economy transition strategy. Digestate from the organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW) is considered, as well as a low-added value product to be properly valorized. In this regard, air gasification may be used to produce syngas. In this work, the production of methanol, hydrogen, or electricity from digestate-derived syngas was assessed by ChemCAD process simulation software. The process scheme of methanol production comprises the following parts: water gas shift (WGS) with carbon capture and storage units (CCS), methanol synthesis, and methanol purification. In the case of hydrogen production, after WGS-CCS, hydrogen was purified from residual nitrogen by pressure swing absorption (PSA). Finally, for electricity production, the digestate-derived syngas was used as fuel in an internal combustion engine. The main objective of this work is to compare the proposed scenarios in terms of CO2 emission intensity and the effect of CO2 storage. In particular, CCS units were used for methanol or hydrogen production with the aim of obtaining high equilibrium yield toward these products. On the basis of 100 kt/year of digestate, results show that the global CO2 savings were 80, 71, and 69 ktCO2eq/year for electricity, methanol, and hydrogen production, respectively. If carbon storage was considered, savings of about 105 and 99 ktCO2eq/year were achieved with methanol and hydrogen production, respectively. The proposed scenarios may provide an attractive option for transitioning into methanol or hydrogen economy of the future.},

ABSTRACT = {Hydrogen purification and CO2 capture are of great significance in refineries and pre-combustion power plants. A dual membrane separator offers an alternative approach for improving H2/CO2 separation efficiency. In this work, H2/CO2/CH4 ternary gas mixtures separation can be achieved by a dual membrane separator with an integrated polyimide (PI) membrane and polydimethylsiloxane/polyetherimide (PDMS/PEI) composite membrane. A hollow fiber dual membrane separation equipment is designed and manufactured. Through the self-designed device, the effects of stage cut, operating temperature, operating pressure, and membrane area ratio on separation performance of dual membrane separator have been studied. The results indicate that, at a high stage cut, a dual membrane separator has obvious advantages over a single membrane separator. Operating temperature has a significant impact on gas permeation rates. At 25 °C, a dual membrane separator can obtain the highest purity of H2 and CO2. By increasing operating pressure, the purity and recovery of H2 and CO2 can be improved simultaneously. The effect of the membrane area ratio on the performance of the dual membrane separator was studied. When the permeate flows of two membranes are approximately equal by changing the membrane area ratio, the overall performance of the dual membrane separator is the best. On the basis of its synergy in promoting separation, the dual membrane separator holds great industrial application potential.},

ABSTRACT = {Zinc-air batteries (ZABs) offer a sustainable and safe pathway to low-cost energy storage. Recent research shows that thermally-sintered porous Zn electrodes with a three-dimensional network structure can enhance the performance and lifetime of ZABs, but they are expensive and energy-intensive to manufacture. In this work, monolithic porous Zn electrodes fabricated through an efficient cold sintering process (CSP) were studied for rechargeable ZABs. Electrochemical studies and extended charge-discharge cycling show good Zn utilization with no observable performance degradation when compared to Zn foil. Post-mortem analysis after 152 h of cycling reveals that the cold-sintered electrodes retain their original structure. A techno-economic assessment of the cold sintering process confirms significant reductions in both the time and energy required to manufacture Zn electrodes compared to a comparable thermal sintering process.},

ABSTRACT = {In this work, a comprehensive experimental analysis on the performance of a 50 cm2 polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cell is presented, including experimental results for a dedicated load cycling test. The harmonized testing protocols defined by the Joint Research Centre (JRC) of the European Commission for automotive applications were followed. With respect to a reference conditions representative of automotive applications, the impact of variations in the cell temperature, reactants pressure, and cathode stoichiometry was analyzed. The results showed that a higher temperature resulted in an increase in cell performance. A higher operating pressure also resulted in higher cell voltages. Higher cathode stoichiometry values negatively affected the cell performance, as relatively dry air was supplied, thus promoting the dry-out of the cell. However, a too low stoichiometry caused a sudden drop in the cell voltage at higher current densities, and also caused significant cell voltage oscillations. No significant cell degradation was observed after the load cycling tests.},

ABSTRACT = {Pipelines are like a lifeline that is vital to a nation’s economic sustainability; as such, pipelines need to be monitored to optimize their performance as well as reduce the product losses incurred in the transportation of petroleum chemicals. A significant number of pipes would be underground; it is of immediate concern to identify and analyse the level of corrosion and assess the quality of a pipe. Therefore, this study intends to present the development of an intelligent model that predicts the condition of crude oil pipeline cantered on specific factors such as metal loss anomalies (over length, width and depth), wall thickness, weld anomalies and pressure flow. The model is developed using Feed-Forward Back Propagation Network (FFBPN) based on historical inspection data from oil and gas fields. The model was trained using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm by changing the number of hidden neurons to achieve promising results in terms of maximum Coefficient of determination (R2) value and minimum Mean Squared Error (MSE). It was identified that a strong R2 value depends on the number of hidden neurons. The model developed with 16 hidden neurons accurately predicted the Estimated Repair Factor (ERF) value with an R2 value of 0.9998. The remaining useful life (RUL) of a pipeline is estimated based on the metal loss growth rate calculations. The deterioration profiles of considered factors are generated to identify the individual impact on pipeline condition. The proposed FFBPN was validated with other published models for its robustness and it was found that FFBPN performed better than the previous approaches. The deterioration curves were generated and it was found that pressure has major negative affect on pipeline condition and weld girth has a minor negative affect on pipeline condition. This study can help petroleum and natural gas industrial operators assess the life condition of existing pipelines and thus enhances their inspection and rehabilitation forecasting.},

ABSTRACT = {Global human pollutant activities have raised greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, which have directly affected the climate. Fossil fuel-based energy has brought a negative impact on the environment and is considered one of the largest sources of GHG emissions. It is envisaged that GHG emissions will increase in the future due to rapid population growth and industrialization. Thus, it is imperative to mitigate climate variability and reduce GHGs by adopting renewable energy (RE) sources for electricity generation. In this regard, the multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) process would serve the purpose of framing out energy policy to analyze these environmentally friendly energy sources. This study uses an integrated decision methodology—a combination of Delphi, fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (FAHP), and the fuzzy weighted aggregated sum product assessment (FWASPAS)—for the adoption of RE sources for electricity generation in Turkey. Initially, the study identified five main criteria and seventeen sub-criteria using the Delphi method. Then, the FAHP method was used to evaluate and rank the main criteria and sub-criteria. Finally, the FWASPAS method was used to assess and prioritize five major RE sources for electricity generation. The FAHP analysis indicated that political criteria are the most influential, followed by economic and technical criteria. Further, the FWASPAS method revealed that wind energy is the most significant option for electricity generation. This decision-making process can help the energy planners to utilize RE sources for sustainable development.},

ABSTRACT = {The application of incinerators for the municipal solid waste (MSW) is growing due to the ability of such instruments to produce energy and, more specifically, reduce waste volume. In this paper, a numerical simulation of the combustion process with the help of the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) inside a portable (mobile) incinerator has been proposed. Such work is done to investigate the most critical parameters for a reliable design of a domestic portable incinerator, which is suitable for the Iranian food and waste culture. An old design of a simple incinerator has been used to apply the natural gas (NG), one of the available cheap fossil fuels in Iran. After that, the waste height, place of the primary burner, and the flow rate of the cooling air inside the incinerator, as the main parameters of the design, are investigated. A validation is also performed for the mesh quality test and the occurrence of the chemical reactions near the burner of the incinerator. Results proved that the numerical results have less than 5% error compared to the previous experimental and numerical approaches. In addition, results show that by moving the primary burner into the secondary chamber of the incinerator, the temperature and the heating ability of the incinerator could be affected dramatically. Moreover, it has been found that by increasing the flow rate of the cooling air inside the incinerator to some extent, the combustion process is improved and, on the other hand, by introducing more cooling air, the evacuation of the hazardous gases from the exhaust is also improved.},

ABSTRACT = {The diesel engine is one of the solutions to slow down fossil fuel depletion due to its high efficiency. However, its high pollutant emission limits its usage in many fields. To improve its efficiency and emissions, a conventional mechanical fuel injection system (MFI) was be replaced with common rail direct injection (CRDI) system for the purpose of this study. In this way, injection parameters such as injection timing, injection pressure and multiple injection schemes can be tuned to enhance the engine performance. The rail pressure and engine speed response of the modified diesel engine was tested. It was found that by advancing the start of injection timing (SOI) timing or increasing the rail pressure, the brake torque generated can be increased. Multiple injection schemes can be implemented to reduce the peak heat release rate (HRR). Post injection was observed to increase the late combustion HRR. The maximum pressure rise rate (PRR) can be reduced by applying pilot injection. Further research was conducted on optimizing fuel injector parameters to improve the indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP) consistency and reduce injector power consumption. The consistency of IMEP was indicated by coefficient of variation (CoV) of IMEP. The injector parameters included open time, low time and duty cycle of injector signals. These parameters were optimized by carrying out response surface methodology. The optimized parameters were observed to be 230 µs for open time, 53µs for low time and 27.5% for duty cycle. The percentage of error of CoV of IMEP and injector power were found to be lower than 5% when the predicted results are compared with experimental results.},

ABSTRACT = {The photovoltaic (PV) industry is an important part of the renewable energy industry. With the growing use of PV systems, interest in their operation and maintenance (O&M) is increasing. In this regard, analyses of power generation efficiency and inverter efficiency are very important. The first step in efficiency analysis is solar power estimation based on environment sensor data. In this study, solar power was estimated using a univariate linear regression model. The estimated solar power data were cross-validated with the actual solar power data obtained from the inverter. The results provide information on the power generation efficiency of the inverter. The linear estimation model developed in this study was validated using a single PV system. It is possible to apply the coefficients presented in this study to other PV systems, even though the nature and error rates of the collected data may vary depending on the inverter manufacturer. To apply the proposed model to PV systems with different power generation capacities, reconstructing the model according to the power generation capacity is necessary.},

ABSTRACT = {Hybrid Renewable Energy Systems (HRESs) have been touted as an appropriate way for supplying electricity to remote and off-grid areas in developing countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), where rural electrification challenges are the most pronounced. This study proposes a two-step methodology for optimizing and analyzing a stand-alone photovoltaic/wind/battery/diesel hybrid system to meet the electricity needs of Fanisua, an off-grid and remote village of northern Nigeria. In the first step, the MATLAB environment was used to run simulations and optimize the system via the genetic algorithm. Then, techno-economic and emissions analysis was carried out in the second step to compare the proposed system to the existing traditional modes of rural electrification in sub-Saharan Africa, namely, the grid-extension and diesel generator. The break-even distance parameter was adopted in the comparison with grid-extension. Besides, the hypothetical project of replacing the diesel generator by the optimal system was analyzed using the Simple Payback Period (SPP) and Net Present Value (NPV) parameters. The resulting optimal design architecture included an 89.271-kW photovoltaic array, a 100.31-W diesel generator, and 148 batteries with a total annualized cost (TAC) and cost of energy (COE) of USD 43,807 and USD 0.25/kWh, respectively. The break-even distance found was 16.2 km, while the NPV and SPP of the hypothetical project were USD 572,382 and 2.8 years, respectively. The savings in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions of the proposed system compared to the grid extension and the diesel generator were found to be 85,401.08 kg/year and 122,062.85 kg/year, respectively. This study highlighted the role that solar PV-based HRESs could play in the sustainable electricity supply in rural areas of sub-Saharan Africa.},

ABSTRACT = {Transitioning to a renewable energy economy requires the widespread integration of solar and wind power, which are intermittent, into the electricity grid. To this goal, it is paramount to develop cost-competitive, reliable, location-independence, and large-scale energy storage technologies. The hydrogen bromine flow battery (HBFB) is a promising technology given the abundant material availability and its high power density. Here, the aim is to perform a comprehensive techno-economic analysis of a 500 kW nominal power/5 MWh HBFB storage system, based on the levelized cost of storage approach. Then, we systematically analyze stack and system components costs for both the current base and a future scenario (2030). We find that, for the base case, HBFB capital investments are competitive to Li-ion battery technology, highlighting the potential of large-scale HBFB market introduction. Improving the stack performance and reducing the stack and system costs are expected to result in ~62% reduction potential in capital investments. The base-case levelized cost of storage, $0.074/kWh, is sufficiently low for a wind-solar storage system to compete with a fossil-based power plant, with potential for reduction to $0.034/kWh in the future scenario. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the levelized cost of storage is most sensitive towards the stack lifetime, which motivates research efforts into advanced electrocatalysts with higher durability and ion-exchange membranes with improved selectivity.},

ABSTRACT = {Biorefineries are novel, productive models that are aimed at producing biobased alternatives to many fossil-based products. Biomass supply and overall energy consumptions are important issues determining the overall biorefinery sustainability. Low-profit lands appear to be a potential option for the sustainable production of raw materials without competition with the food chain. Cardoon particularly matches these characteristics, thanks to the rapid growth and the economy of the cultivation and harvesting steps. An integrated biorefinery processing 60 kton/y cardoon lignocellulosic biomass for the production of 1,4-butanediol (bio-BDO) is presented and discussed in this work. After designing the biorefinery flowsheet, the mass and energy balances were calculated. The results indicated that the energy recovery system has been designed to almost completely cover the entire energy requirement of the BDO production process. Despite the lower supply of electricity, the energy recovery system can cover around 78% of the total electricity demand. Instead, the thermal energy recovery system was able to satisfy the overall demand of the sugar production process entirely, while BDO purification columns require high-pressure steam. The thermal energy recovery system can cover around 83% of the total thermal demand. Finally, a cradle-to-gate simplified environmental assessment was conducted in order to evaluate the environmental impact of the process in terms of carbon footprint. The carbon footprint value calculated for the entire production process of BDO was 2.82 kgCO2eq/kgBDO. The cultivation phase accounted for 1.94 kgCO2eq/kgBDO, the transport had very little impact, only for 0.067 kgCO2eq/kgBDO, while the biorefinery phase contributes for 0.813 kgCO2eq/kgBDO.},

ABSTRACT = {Although alkaline water electrolysis (AWE) is the most widespread technology for hydrogen production by electrolysis, its electrochemical and fluid dynamic optimization has rarely been addressed simultaneously using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation. In this regard, a two-dimensional (2D) CFD model of an AWE cell has been developed using COMSOL® software and then experimentally validated. The model involves transport equations for both liquid and gas phases as well as equations for the electric current conservation. This multiphysics approach allows the model to simultaneously analyze the fluid dynamic and electrochemical phenomena involved in an electrolysis cell. The electrical response was evaluated in terms of polarization curve (voltage vs. current density) at different operating conditions: temperature, electrolyte conductivity, and electrode-diaphragm distance. For all cases, the model fits very well with the experimental data with an error of less than 1% for the polarization curves. Moreover, the model successfully simulates the changes on gas profiles along the cell, according to current density, electrolyte flow rate, and electrode-diaphragm distance. The combination of electrochemical and fluid dynamics studies provides comprehensive information and makes the model a promising tool for electrolysis cell design.},

ABSTRACT = {The coal to ethylene glycol (CTEG) process has drawn much attention due to the serious conflict between supply and demand of ethylene glycol in China. However, it is inevitably accompanied by the problem of high CO2 emissions. Carbon capture is one of the most promising potential effective ways to address this issue. However, the CTEG process, integrated with carbon capture technology, will lead to energy and economic penalties. Thus, a comprehensive evaluation of CTEG process with different CO2 capture technologies is urgently needed. This study analyzed the technoeconomic performance of four CO2 capture alternatives for the CTEG process: Rectisol, mono-ethanol amine (MEA), chilled ammonia process (CAP) and dimethyl carbonate (DMC) technologies. Results show the energy consumption of CO2 capture of the Rectisol process is the lowest, 1.88 GJ/tCO2, followed by the DMC process, 2.10 GJ/tCO2, the CAP process, 3.64 GJ/tCO2, and the MEA process, 5.20 GJ/tCO2. The CO2 capture cost of the Rectisol process is lowest, CNY 169.5/tCO2, followed by the DMC process, CNY 193.2/tCO2, the CAP process CNY 232.6/tCO2, and the MEA process CNY 250.5/tCO2. As the Rectisol technology has the best comprehensive performance, it is the best option for CTEG industry in comparison with the MEA, CAP, and DMC technologies.},

ABSTRACT = {For the sour water strippers in petroleum refinery plants, three prediction models were developed first, including the estimators of sour water feed concentrations using convenient online measurements, the minimum reboiler duty and the corresponding internal temperature at a specific location (Tstage,29). Feedforward control schemes were developed based on these prediction models. Four categories of control schemes, including feedforward, feedback, feedback with external reset, and feedforward-feedback, were proposed and evaluated by the rigorous dynamic simulation model of the sour water stripper for their dynamic responses to the sour water feed stream disturbances. The comparison of control performance, in terms of the settling time, integrated absolute error (IAE) of the NH3 concentration of the stripped sour water and IAE of the specific reboiler duty, reveals that FFT (feedforward control of Tstage,29) and FBA-DT3 (feedback control with 3 min concentration measurement delay) are the best control schemes. The second-best control scheme is FBAT (cascade feedback control of concentration with temperature).},

ABSTRACT = {Agitated vessels (or mechanically stirred reactors) are heat exchange devices that are most widely used in many chemical and biochemical process industries, such as anaerobic digestion process. The mixing and heat transfer performances in these vessels are of crucial importance for increasing the energy efficiency in both batch and continuous processes. In this paper, a series of experiments were conducted to investigate heat transfer performance in agitated vessels for various configurations. In fact, this study examines the effects of heat transfer geometry (wall jacket and helical coils), heating power, and stirring speed, on the heating performance of two stirred fluids—water alone and a mixture of water and food waste. The experiments were conducted using a jacketed insulation tank with a helical coil and a propeller agitator. In each experiment, a transient method, based on measuring the temperature dependency on time, and solving the unsteady enthalpy balance, was used to determine the overall heat transfer coefficients between the agitated fluid and the heating surface. Finally, an extensive analysis of the reduced data was conducted based on temperature, heating time, heat transfer rate, heat transfer coefficient, and thermal resistance. The main finding was that the presence of food waste in agitated vessels reduces the heat rate of the agitated fluid with an average of 18.13% and 49.51%, respectively, for the case of JHX and CHX, and creates additional fouling, which further limits the heat transfer.},

ABSTRACT = {Hydrogen-fueled fuel cells are considered one of the key strategies to tackle the achievement of fully-sustainable mobility. The transportation sector is paying significant attention to the development and industrialization of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) to be introduced alongside batteries, reaching the goal of complete de-carbonization. In this paper a multi-phase, multi-component, and non-isothermal 3D-CFD model is presented to simulate the fluid, heat, and charge transport processes developing inside a hydrogen/air PEMFC with a serpentine-type gas distributor. Model results are compared against experimental data in terms of polarization and power density curves, including an improved formulation of exchange current density at the cathode catalyst layer, improving the simulation results’ accuracy in the activation-dominated region. Then, 3D-CFD fields of reactants’ delivery to the active electrochemical surface, reaction rates, temperature distributions, and liquid water formation are analyzed, and critical aspects of the current design are commented, i.e., the inhomogeneous use of the active surface for reactions, limiting the produced current and inducing gradients in thermal and reaction rate distribution. The study shows how a complete multi-dimensional framework for physical and chemical processes of PEMFC can be used to understand limiting processes and to guide future development.},

ABSTRACT = {The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) has experienced rapid social and economic development in the past decades, while energy shortage, environmental pollution, and climate change are the factors that prevent a sustainable development process. Deployment of solar photovoltaic (PV) power is one of the effective alternatives to overcome the above barriers and assist ASEAN to achieve the aspirational target of 23% renewable energy (RE) in the total primary energy supply (TPES). In this study, SWOT analysis is adopted to analyze the internal strengths and weaknesses and the external threats and opportunities tightly related to the development of solar PV power in ASEAN countries. Through the SWOT analysis, great potential for the development of solar PV power in ASEAN is found. As long as appropriate policies are implemented and proper actions are taken, huge space for deployment of solar PV power can be expected. Based on the SWOT analysis, countermeasures that emphasize further deployment of solar PV power in ASEAN countries are put forward. The tactics include arousing people’s awareness of a sustainable development process, government issue coherence and stable incentive policies, fostering a solar PV industry chain and master key technology, and seek opportunities via an international cooperation.},

ABSTRACT = {Condition assessment of insulating oil is crucial for the reliable long-term operation of power equipment, especially power transformers. Under thermal aging, critical degradation in oil properties, including chemical, physical, and dielectric properties, occurs due to the generation of aging byproducts. Ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy was recently proposed for the condition assessment of mineral oil. However, this absorption technique may involve all electronic states of the investigated material which typically yield a broad spectrum, and thus cannot precisely reflect the electronic structure of aged oil samples. It also cannot be implemented as an online sensor of oil degradation. In this paper, photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy is introduced, for the first time, for effective condition assessment of insulating oil. The PL technique involves emission processes that only occur between a narrow band of electronic states that are occupied by thermalized electrons and consequently yields a spectrum that is much narrower than that of the absorption spectrum. Aged oil samples with different aging extents were prepared in the laboratory using accelerated aging tests at 120 °C, under which 1 day of laboratory aging is equivalent to approximately 1 year of aging in the field. These aged samples were then tested using PL spectroscopy with a wavelength ranging from 150 nm to 1500 nm. Two main parameters were evaluated for quantitative analysis of PL spectra: The full width at half-maximum and the enclosed area under the PL spectra. These parameters were correlated to the aging extent. In conjunction with PL spectroscopy, the aged oil samples were tested for the dielectric dissipation factor as an indication of the number of aging byproducts. Interestingly, we find a correlation between the PL spectra and the dielectric dissipation factor. The results of PL spectroscopy were compared to those of UV-Vis spectroscopy for the same samples and the parameters extracted from PL spectra were compared to the aging b-products extracted from UV-Vis spectra. Finally, the corresponding physical mechanisms were discussed considering the obtained results and the spectral shift for each spectrum. It was proved that PL spectroscopy is a promising technique for the condition assessment of insulating oil when compared to conventional transformer oil assessment measuring techniques and even to other optical absorption techniques.},

ABSTRACT = {The powertrain system is critical to the reliability of a battery electric vehicle (BEV). However, the BEV powertrain is a complex system; it includes the motor, motor controller, power distribution unit, battery system, etc. The failure of any of these components may result in the failure of the entire powertrain system and eventually cause serious traffic accidents on the road. However, how much does each component affect the reliability of the entire system, and which components are the most vulnerable in the entire system? These questions are still unanswered today. To develop a reliability design for a BEV powertrain system, it is essential to conduct detailed research by investigating the most vulnerable component parts of the entire powertrain. In the present study, a fault-tree model of the entire powertrain and its subsystems was developed. Based on this model, the failure rates of all components were calculated first. Then, trends in the reliability indices for the entire powertrain and its components were estimated against BEV service life. From the estimation results, we learned that with increased service time, the reliability of the entire powertrain system is indeed much lower than that of its individual subsystems. Moreover, through comparative research, we found that the battery module is the most unreliable component not only of the battery system, but the entire powertrain system. Additionally, it was interesting to find that the reliability of the motor components was higher than that of other subsystem components, but that the reliability indices for the entire motor were not the highest among all the powertrain subsystems studied in this paper. We believe the findings of the present study will be of great significance to an improved understanding of the reliability design and maintenance of BEVs.},

ABSTRACT = {Despite the increasing contribution of the automotive industry to China’s national economy, CO2 emissions have become a challenge. However, the research about its energy consumption and carbon emissions is lacking. The significance of this study is to fill the research gap and provide suggestions for China’s automotive industry to reduce its carbon emissions. In this paper, the extended logarithmic Division index (LMDI) method is adopted to decompose the factors affecting carbon emissions and determine the key driving forces. According to provincial statistical data in China in 2017, the annual emissions of six provinces exceeded five million tons, accounting for 55.44% of the total emissions in China. The largest source of emissions in China is in Jilin Province, followed by Jiangsu, Shandong, Shanghai, Hubei and Henan. The decomposition results show that investment intensity effect is the greatest factor for CO2 emissions, while R&D intensity and energy intensity are the two principal factors for emission reduction. After the identification of driving factors, mitigation measures are proposed considering the current state of affairs and real situation, including improving energy structure, accelerating product structure transformation, stimulating sound R&D investment activities, promoting energy conservation and new energy automobile industry development and boosting industrial cluster development.},

ABSTRACT = {Biomass pellet fuel is one of the development directions of renewable energy. The purpose of the article is to study the combustion characteristics of five kinds of biomass pellet fuel that can be used as biomass fuel and analyze their combustion kinetics. The thermogravimetric method (TG method) was used to analyze the combustion characteristics of five kinds of biomass pellet fuel and to calculate the index S of comprehensive combustion characteristic. The Arrhenius equation and the Coats–Redfern method were used to analyze the combustion kinetics of five kinds of biomass pellet fuel. The activation energy and pre-exponential factor were obtained according to different temperature ranges. Conclusions are as follows: The pyrolysis of five kinds of biomass pellet fuel mainly includes three stages: (1) water evaporation stage, (2) volatile component combustion stage, (3) fixed carbon oxidation stage. The TG curves of five kinds of biomass pellet fuel are roughly the same at the same heating rate. The peaks of thermal weight loss rate and maximum degradation rate are both in the high temperature range. The differential thermal gravity (DTG) curves of five kinds of biomass pellet fuel have an obvious peak. The peak temperature of the largest peak in the DTG curves is 280–310 °C. The first-order reaction equation is used to obtain the kinetic parameters in stages. The correlation coefficients are bigger than the value of 0.92. The fitting results are in good agreement with the experimental results. The activation energy of each sample is basically the same in each stage. The value in the volatile matter combustion stage is 56–542 kJ/mol, and the activation energy of the carbon layer slowly increases rapidly. The five kinds of biomass pellet fuels have good combustion characteristics and kinetic characteristics, and they can be promoted and applied as biomass pellet fuels in the future.},

ABSTRACT = {In the past few decades, water and air were commonly used as working fluid to evaluate shell and tube heat exchanger (STHE) performance. This study was undertaken to estimate heat transfer coefficients and evaluate performance in the pilot-scale twisted tube-based STHE using the flue gas from biomass co-combustion as working fluid. Theoretical calculation along with experimental results were used to calculate the specific heat of flue gas. A simplified model was then developed from the integration of two heat transfer methods to predict the overall heat transfer coefficient without tedious calculation of individual heat transfer coefficients and fouling factors. Performance including water and trailer temperature, heat load, effectiveness, and overall heat transfer coefficient were jointly investigated under variable operating conditions. Results indicated that the specific heat of flue gas from co-combustion ranging between 1.044 and 1.338 kJ/kg·K while specific heat was increased by increasing flue gas temperature and decreasing excess air ratio. The developed mathematical model was validated to have relatively small errors to predict the overall heat transfer coefficient. A flue gas mass flow rate of 61.3–98.8 kg/h, a water flow rate of 13.7–14.1 L/min, and a parallel arrangement of two water-to-air heaters in an empty trailer were found to be optimal conditions for space heating purpose. In addition, a lower poultry litter feeding rate decreased heat loss of flue gas and increased heat gain of water, while a lower water flow rate also provided a lower maximum possible heat transfer rate with a higher actual heat transfer rate to quickly achieve heat equilibrium that ultimately improves the performance. This study demonstrates the possibility of collecting residual heat from the flue gas using the pilot-scale STHE system while outlining a systematic approach and process for evaluating its performance.},

ABSTRACT = {In this work, single-phase (liquid water) and two-phase (liquid water and gaseous oxygen) 3D-CFD flow analysis of the anode of a high pressure PEM electrolysis cell was conducted. 3D-CFD simulation models of the anode side porous transport layer of a PEM electrolyzer cell were created for the flow analysis. For the geometrical modelling of the PTL, two approaches were used: (a) modelling the exact geometry and (b) modelling a simplified geometry using a porosity model. Before conducting two-phase simulations, the model was validated using a single-phase approach. The Eulerian multiphase and the volume-of-fluid approaches were used for the two-phase modelling and the results were compared. Furthermore, a small section of the PTL was isolated to focus on the gas bubble flow and behaviour in more detail. The results showed plausible tendencies regarding pressure drop, velocity distribution and gas volume fraction distribution. The simplified geometry using the porous model could adequately replicate the results of the exact geometry model with a significant reduction in simulation time. The developed simulation model can be used for further investigations and gives insight into two-phase flow phenomena in the PTL. Additionally, the information obtained from simulation can aid the design and evaluation of new PTL structures.},

ABSTRACT = {The cooling coefficient of performance (COPR) and energy efficiency ratio (EER) of refrigerant R-134a compressors (single- and double-compressors) with different refrigerant tonnage (200, 250, 300, 380, 500, and 700 RT) for centrifugal and Maglev centrifugal compressors change with different operating performance load percentages (10–100%), and constant-frequency and variable-frequency operation, resulting in performance differences. In particular, a water chiller can have a fixed cooling water inlet temperature of 32 °C and a variable cooling water inlet temperature between 18.33 °C and 32 °C. According to the actual test results, the commercial performance code program and parameter table of the water chiller were established. Based on the performance matching of different load chillers, the on-site load capacity was analyzed and the effective water chiller performance and model matching were determined as the best choice for the tonR number of the deicing machine and unit matching, providing a reference for a future large water chiller that cannot be used on site for a single unit tonR. To achieve energy-saving benefits, different types of compressors, different refrigeration tonR operation, constant-frequency unit and variable-frequency unit alternate operation, and different operating performance load percentage operation can be allocated. Finally, the results show that, when the cooling water inlet temperature is fixed, the Maglev variable-frequency centrifugal compressor water chiller is better than the constant-frequency centrifugal water chiller, and also better than the variable-frequency centrifugal water chiller. The larger the freezing tonR of the variable-frequency centrifugal water chiller, the smaller the difference between COPR and EER. When the cooling water inlet temperature changes, the Maglev variable-frequency centrifugal water chiller is better than the constant-frequency centrifugal water chiller, and it is also better than the variable-frequency centrifugal water chiller. The larger the freezing tonR of the variable-frequency centrifugal water chiller, the smaller the difference between COPR and EER. Moreover, the operating performance of the constant-frequency centrifugal water chiller is between 60% and 90%, which can maintain relatively high COPR and EER values. The operating performance of the variable-frequency centrifugal water chiller is between 40% and 70%, which can maintain relatively high COPR and EER values. Compared with the constant-frequency and variable-frequency, the Maglev variable-frequency centrifugal water chiller can maintain higher COPR and EER values when the operating performance is between 10% and 100%. When the operating performance is between 10% and 70%, it can maintain very high COPR and EER values. When the water chiller is selected in the field, the energy-saving of COPR and EER will be given priority. Therefore, the load capacity can be used to effectively manage the water chiller performance and model selection, so that the operation performance can reach the best percentage and energy saving can be achieved.},

ABSTRACT = {The Atkinson cycle, where expansion ratio is higher than the compression ratio, is one of the methods used to improve thermal efficiency of engines. Miller improved the Atkinson cycle by controlling the intake- or exhaust-valve closing timing, a technique which is called the Miller cycle. The Otto–Miller cycle can improve thermal efficiency and reduce NOx emission by reducing compression work; however, it must compensate for the compression pressure and maintain the intake air mass through an effective compression ratio or turbocharge. Hence, we performed thermodynamic cycle analysis with changes in the intake-valve closing timing for the Otto–Miller cycle and evaluated the engine performance and Miller timing through the resulting problems and solutions. When only the compression ratio was compensated, the theoretical thermal efficiency of the Otto–Miller cycle improved by approximately 18.8% compared to that of the Otto cycle. In terms of thermal efficiency, it is more advantageous to compensate only the compression ratio; however, when considering the output of the engine, it is advantageous to also compensate the boost pressure to maintain the intake air mass flow rate.},

ABSTRACT = {The global focus on the use of renewable energy resources was mainly reignited by the signing of the Kyoto Protocol Agreement in 1997. Since then, the world has seen a great deal of progress in terms of the production and consumption of renewable energy. This in turn is rapidly powering economic growth and social development around the globe. Contrary to popular belief, the use of renewable energy is not limited to developed countries only. The developing countries are also rapidly endorsing renewable energy as a vital engine of economic growth and societal development. In this regard, even though renewable energy production and consumption are in their infancy in BRICS, these countries are taking concrete steps towards the development of renewable energy resources. The results of previous studies have indicated that with an increase in the GDP of a country its carbon footprint also tends to increase; the Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa (BRICS) countries are no exception in this regard. One of the main challenges in research related to measuring the contribution of renewable energy towards economic growth is the use of a singular model or techniques that may not be appropriate for the generalization of the results. This study intends to overcome this challenge by application of multiple econometric-based models which include the “Cross Dependency” test, the unit root test, and “CIPS” (cross-sectional augmented IPS). Besides these the second generation, stochastic models based upon econometrics, such as the DOLS test (dynamic ordinary least square) and the FMOLS (fully modified ordinary least square) are also applied for verification of the contribution of renewable energy towards the economic growth of the BRICS countries. The novelty of the study mainly stems from fact that these models are seldom applied in tandem and especially in the BRICS countries. The results of the study indicate that the existence of the bi-directional relationship between the use of renewable energy and economic growth is mainly indicated by the increase in GDP, thus lending support to the feedback hypothesis. Moreover, the conservation hypothesis was proven by the existence of a unidirectional causality relationship between the use of renewable energy and CO2 emissions. Alongside these, the study also included sensitivity analysis to gauge the impact of the growth of GDP on the CO2 emissions of BRICS countries, and regression analysis was performed to create an EKC curve which was used to gauge not only the sensitivity but also to help in highlighting the impact of using renewable energy in controlling and reducing CO2 emissions, thus proving the EKC theory. Thus, it can be deduced that increase in CO2 emissions is of major concern for the BRICS countries, which has led them to increase the production of renewable energy. Based upon the findings of the present study it is recommended that policymakers should encourage the use of renewable energy by offering incentives in financial terms, such as interest-free or low-interest loans, subsidies and feed-in tariffs.},

ABSTRACT = {Air pollution, especially in large cities around the world, is associated with serious problems both with people’s health and the environment. Over the past few years, there has been a particularly intensive demand for alternatives to fossil fuels, because when they are burned, substances that pollute the environment are released. In addition to the smoke from fuels burned for heating and harmful emissions that industrial installations release, the exhaust emissions of vehicles create a large share of the fossil fuel pollution. Alternative fuels, known as non-conventional and advanced fuels, are derived from resources other than fossil fuels. Because alcoholic fuels have several physical and propellant properties similar to those of gasoline, they can be considered as one of the alternative fuels. Alcoholic fuels or alcohol-blended fuels may be used in gasoline engines to reduce exhaust emissions. This study aimed to develop a gasoline engine model to predict the influence of different types of alcohol-blended fuels on performance and emissions. For the purpose of this study, the AVL Boost software was used to analyse characteristics of the gasoline engine when operating with different mixtures of ethanol, methanol, butanol, and gasoline (by volume). Results obtained from different fuel blends showed that when alcohol blends were used, brake power decreased and the brake specific fuel consumption increased compared to when using gasoline, and CO and HC concentrations decreased as the fuel blends percentage increased.},

ABSTRACT = {To improve the combustion and emission characteristics of diesel engines, methanol-diesel fuels with different mixing ratios (DM0, DM10, DM20, DM30, and DM40) were used to investigate the effects of methanol addition on the combustion and emission of a four-stroke diesel engine in terms of cylinder pressure, brake power, brake-specific fuel consumption, and nitrogen oxides, soot, and carbon monoxide emissions. Firstly, an improved entire diesel engine model was developed using AVL-BOOST software and validated by the experimental results. The results showed that the increase of methanol content in the fuel mixture had a negative impact on the performance characteristic of the diesel engine, but significantly improved the emission characteristic of the diesel engine. With the methanol ratio in the mixed fuel increased to 10%, 20%, 30%, and 40%, the cylinder pressure of the engine increased by 0.89%, 1.48%, 2.29%, and 3.17%, respectively. However, the power decreased by 3.76%, 6.74%, 11.35%, and 15.45%, the torque decreased by 3.76%, 6.74%, 11.35%, and 15.45%, respectively, and the brake specific fuel consumption increased by 3.77%, 6.92%, 12.33%, and 17.61%, respectively. In addition, with the methanol ratio in the mixed fuel increased to 10%, 20%, 30%, and 40%, the carbon monoxide emission decreased by 21.32%, 39.04%, 49.81%, and 56.59% and the soot emission decreased by 0.25%, 8.69%, 16.81%, and 25.28%, respectively. Therefore, the addition of methanol to the fuel can improve the combustion and emission characteristics of the engine.},

ABSTRACT = {Kiln is a prime need in the ceramics industry, where energy loss is a major part which consumes about 60% production cost through thermal energy for different applications. Higher density of fired and tunnel kiln refractory material lowers the thermal diffusivity and the proper selection of fired material minimizes the energy loss along the kiln. In particular, this research analysed the results of a heat recovery system comprised of a metallic recuperator which gives around 8% energy savings in natural gas consumption. In this work, detailed power quality analysis of low-power factor motors of a tunnel kiln was carried out and a power factor improvement solution was suggested to save electrical energy with payback period of 0.8 y. The motor operating at a low-power factor consumes more reactive power which does not produce beneficial work. A low-power factor around 0.4 causes network power loss, increases in transformer loss and voltage drops. The solution with accumulative capacitance power of 148.05 uF was installed to achieve the power factor to 0.9. Flu gas analyzer was installed to monitor the range of O2 in pre-heating, oxidation, and firing zones of the kiln which should be ≥8% and 3%, respectively. Regression analysis for thermal energy consumption of a tunnel kiln is done to find the forecast thermal energy consumption. This analysis can be used to find operational efficiency, supporting decisions regarding dependent variable of thermal energy consumption and independent variable of production. This research is very helpful for the ceramics industry to mitigate the energy loss at SMEs as well as in mass production level.},

ABSTRACT = {Battery cell production is a complex process chain with interlinked manufacturing processes. Calendering in particular has an enormous influence on the subsequent manufacturing steps and final cell performance. However, the effects on the mechanical properties of the electrode, in particular, have been insufficiently investigated. For this reason, the impact of different densification rates during calendering on the electrochemical cell performance of NMC811 (LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2) half-cells are investigated to identify the relevant calendering parameters. Based on this investigation, an experimental design has been derived. Electrode elongations after calendering in and orthogonal to the running direction of the NMC811 cathode are investigated in comparison with a hard carbon anode after calendering. Elongations orthogonal to the machine direction are observed to have no major dependencies on the compaction rate during calendering. In the machine direction, however, significant elongation occurs as a dependency of the compaction rate for both the hard carbon anode and the NMC811. In addition, the geometric shape of the NMC811 electrodes after separation into individual sheets is investigated with regard to different compaction rates during calendering. It is shown that the corrugations that occur during calendering are propagated into the single electrode, depending on the compaction rate.},

ABSTRACT = {The Archimedes/Archimedean screw generator (ASG) is a fish-friendly hydropower technology that could operate under a wide range of flow heads and flow rates and generate power from almost any flow, even wastewater. The simplicity and low maintenance requirements and costs make ASGs suitable even for remote or developing areas. However, there are no general and easy-to-use guidelines for designing Archimedes screw power plants. Therefore, this study addresses this important concern by offering a simple method for quick rough estimations of the number and geometry of Archimedes screws in considering the installation site properties, river flow characteristics, and technical considerations. Moreover, it updates the newest analytical method of designing ASGs by introducing an easier graphical approach that not only covers standard designs but also simplifies custom designs. Besides, a list of currently installed and operating industrial multi-Archimedes screw hydropower plants are provided to review and explore the common design properties between different manufacturers. On top of that, this study helps to improve one of the biggest burdens of small projects, the unscalable initial investigation costs, by enabling everyone to evaluate the possibilities of a green and renewable Archimedes screw hydropower generation where a flow is available.},

ABSTRACT = {Hydrogen is expected to be a next-generation energy source that does not emit carbon dioxide, but when used as a fuel, the issue is the increase in the amount of NOx that is caused by the increase in flame temperature. In this study, we experimentally investigated NOx emissions rate when hydrogen was burned in a hydrocarbon gas burner, which is used in a wide temperature range. As a result of the experiments, the amount of NOx when burning hydrogen in a nozzle mixed burner was twice as high as when burning city gas. However, by increasing the flow velocity of the combustion air, the amount of NOx could be reduced. In addition, by reducing the number of combustion air nozzles rather than decreasing the diameter of the air nozzles, a larger recirculation flow could be formed into the furnace, and the amount of NOx could be reduced by up to 51%. Furthermore, the amount of exhaust gas recirculation was estimated from the reduction rate of NOx, and the validity was confirmed by the relationship between adiabatic flame temperature and NOx calculated from the equilibrium calculation by chemical kinetics simulator software.},

ABSTRACT = {The adaptability of vehicle-mounted heating systems that include burner and stove remarkably influences the system efficiency, heat flux uniformity, and pollutants emission. In this work, the performance of a rotary cup burner assembly with three different cooking stoves was investigated using ANSYS Fluent software based on five factors of thermal efficiency, heat transfer intensity, heating uniformity, CO emissions, and flue gas outlet temperature. The Eulerian-Lagrangian method was used to perform the diesel spray, and the shear stress transfer k-ω turbulence model and the probability density function model were employed to simulate the turbulent combustion. Based on the simulation results, the performance pentagon of the above five factors was constructed to evaluate the comprehensive performance of the new rotary cup burner system. The rotary cup burner had a good performance when it is used in two staple food stoves and a subsidiary food stove. In staple food stove A, its higher furnace increased the heat exchange area of the vessel, while the higher fireboard of staple food stove B caused a higher heat transfer intensity at the bottom of the vessel. However, the higher fireboard also led to higher CO emissions. In consideration of these two factors, the thermal efficiency of stove A was about 7% higher than that of stove B. Different from the staple food stove, the furnace of subsidiary food stove C had better wrapping to the bottom of the boiler so that it had the highest heat transfer intensity. The obtained performance pentagon shows that the comprehensive adaptability performance of stove A was the best and that of stove B was the worst, which is mainly caused by the height of the fireboard and the shape of the vessel. This research guides the optimization of the heating system and promotes the application of the rotary cup burner.},

ABSTRACT = {Methanol, as a promising carbon-neutral fuel, has become a research hotspot worldwide. In this study, pure gasoline and gasoline blended with five different volume ratios of methanol (10%, 20%, 30%, 50%, and 75%) were selected as test fuels, which were referred to as M0, M10, M20, M30, M50, and M75. The experiments on carbon and pollutant emissions and performance were carried out on a passenger vehicle with gasoline direct injection (GDI) turbocharged engine using the steady-state, new European driving cycle (NEDC), and acceleration approaches. The results show that under steady-state conditions, as the methanol blending ratio increases, the volume of fuel consumption increases. Compared with pure gasoline, the equivalent fuel consumption and the CO2 emissions are reduced by 0.95 L/100 km (10.6%) and 18.95 g/km (9.6%) in maximum extent by fueling M75, respectively. In the NEDC, the CO2 emissions of M30 are reduced by 5.46 g/km (3.7%) compared with pure gasoline. After blending methanol in gasoline, CO emissions increase, and the emissions of NOx, THC, and PM decrease. The acceleration time is shortened with the increase of blending ratio of methanol. The application of methanol reduces the combustion CO2 emissions by 10% and improves the pollutant emissions.},

ABSTRACT = {Biodiesel can substitute for conventional diesel fuel and contribute to the decarbonization of the transportation sector. To improve biodiesel sustainability and decrease production costs, low-grade fats such as non-edible animal fats must be used. Animal fats are mixed with tissues which must be removed before alcoholysis to avoid biodiesel contamination with nitrogen and phosphorus-containing compounds. Biodiesel was produced by the methanolysis of beef tallow and beef tallow/soybean oil mixtures over calcium heterogeneous catalysts obtained by the calcination of scallop shells. The tallow from fatty bovine tissues was extracted using boiling water, dry microwave treatment, and acetone extraction. The thermal stability and the moisture content of the extracted fats were evaluated by thermogravimetry. The thermograms of fats revealed that microwave treatment, which was faster (3 min instead of 40 min for boiling water and 240 min for acetone extraction) and had the lowest energy consumption, led to a dry fat with a thermal stability analogous to that of fats extracted with boiling water and acetone. All the extracted fats behaved similarly in the methanolysis reaction over calcium catalyst, with biodiesel yield (61–62%) being 30% lower than the analogous obtained from soybean oil (88%). Co-processing the extracted tallow with soybean oil overcomes the drawback related to the low-grade fats.},

ABSTRACT = {Machine learning (ML) approaches have risen in popularity for use in many oil and gas (O&G) applications. Time series-based predictive forecasting of hydrocarbon production using deep learning ML strategies that can generalize temporal or sequence-based information within data is fast gaining traction. The recent emphasis on hydrocarbon production provides opportunities to explore the use of deep learning ML to other facets of O&G development where dynamic, temporal dependencies exist and that also hold implications to production forecasting. This study proposes a combination of supervised and unsupervised ML approaches as part of a framework for the joint prediction of produced water and natural gas volumes associated with oil production from unconventional reservoirs in a time series fashion. The study focuses on the pay zones within the Spraberry and Wolfcamp Formations of the Midland Basin in the U.S. The joint prediction model is based on a deep neural network architecture leveraging long short-term memory (LSTM) layers. Our model has the capability to both reproduce and forecast produced water and natural gas volumes for wells at monthly resolution and has demonstrated 91 percent joint prediction accuracy to held out testing data with little disparity noted in prediction performance between the training and test datasets. Additionally, model predictions replicate water and gas production profiles to wells in the test dataset, even for circumstances that include irregularities in production trends. We apply the model in tandem with an Arps decline model to generate cumulative first and five-year estimates for oil, gas, and water production outlooks at the well and basin-levels. Production outlook totals are influenced by well completion, decline curve, and spatial and reservoir attributes. These types of model-derived outlooks can aid operators in formulating management or remedial solutions for the volumes of fluids expected from unconventional O&G development.},

ABSTRACT = {The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is making significant progress in improving its economy by attracting tourists and trade. In the short run, however, economic activity will continue to be more based on oil, natural gas, and related industries. Rising demand for natural gas for power plants and industrial users, such as petrochemicals and steelmakers, has made the UAE a net gas importer, prompting the country to launch multibillion-dollar investments in nuclear and renewable energy. This study addresses the trend of solar energy production and consumption in the UAE. The strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis was performed on the different types of solar energy in the UAE, and some strategies were developed based on it. The SWOT analysis reveals promising strategies for the UAE’s solar energy transition that would reduce fossil fuel demand, mitigate greenhouse gas emissions through solar energy production, and transform the UAE into the carbon market centre of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.},

ABSTRACT = {The glass industry is highly energy-intensive, consuming approximately 500–700 million GJ each year. Replacing inefficient equipment with better-performing equipment is a good strategy to reduce the energy consumption of a glass plant. Since there are many alternative solutions, the choice of which technological improvement to implement is usually difficult. Therefore, a review of solutions to reduce energy consumption in a glass plant is pivotal. The literature offers similar studies, but they are not sufficiently up-to-date and do not represent the actual state of the art, which should be updated. Thus, this paper aims to provide an updated list of alternative solutions, clustering them into different categories (e.g., the process stage). Moreover, this paper investigates the current applicability of energy-saving solutions in Italy. Specifically, a sample of 103 Italian companies is considered and the type of interventions that the companies recently implemented or that they intend to adopt is analyzed. Quantitative statistical and economic analyses were conducted to highlight the most popular solutions and determine their cost-effectiveness. The results show that most interventions consist of replacing machinery with more efficient ones, mainly in auxiliary systems (132 out of 426). The outcome of this paper could represent a guide to select energy-saving solutions.},

ABSTRACT = {Accurate prediction of the compressive strength of concrete is of great significance to construction quality and progress. In order to understand the current research status in the concrete compressive strength prediction field, a bibliometric analysis of the relevant literature published in this field in the last decade was conducted first. The 3135 journal articles published from 2012 to 2021 in the Web of Science core database were used as the database, and the knowledge map was drawn with the help of the visualisation software CiteSpace 6.1R2 to analyse the field at the macro level in terms of spatial and temporal distribution, hotspot distribution and evolutionary trends, respectively. Afterwards, we go into the detail and divide concrete compressive strength prediction methods into two categories: traditional and machine-learning methods, and introduce the typical methods of each. In addition, a boosting-based ensemble machine-learning algorithm, namely the gradient boosting regression tree (GBRT) algorithm, is proposed for predicting the compressive strength of concrete. 1030 sets of concrete compressive strength test data were collected as the dataset, of which 60% were used to train the model, 20% to validate the model and 20% to test the trained model. The coefficient of determination (R2) of the GBRT model was 0.92, the mean square error (MSE) was 22.09 MPa, and the root mean square error (RMSE) was 4.7 MPa, which is an excellent prediction accuracy compared to prediction models constructed by other machine-learning algorithms. In addition, a five-fold cross-validation analysis was carried out, and the eight input variables were analyzed for their characteristic importance.},

ABSTRACT = {In addition to main fractures, a large number of secondary fractures are formed after the volumetric fracturing of shale gas wells. The secondary fracture properties are so complex, that it is difficult to identify and diagnose by direct monitoring methods. In this study, a new approach to model and diagnose secondary fracture properties is presented. First, a new pressure decline model, which is composed of four interconnected domains, i.e., wellbore, main fractures, secondary fractures, and reservoir matrix pores, is built. Then, the fracturing fluid pumping and post-fracturing soaking processes are simulated. The simulated pressure derivatives reflect five fracture-dominated flow regimes, which correspond to multiple alternating positive and negative slopes of the pressure decline derivative. The results of sensitivity simulation show that the density, permeability, and width of secondary fractures are the main controlling factors affecting the size ratio. Finally, based on the simulated pressure decline characteristics, a diagnostic method for the identification and analysis of secondary fracture properties is formed. This method is then applied to three platform wells in the Changning shale gas field in China. This study builds the correlation between the secondary fracture properties and the shut-in pressure decline characteristics, and also provides a theoretical method for comprehensive post-fracturing evaluation of shale gas horizontal wells.},
