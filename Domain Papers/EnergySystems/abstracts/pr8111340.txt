One of the most important problems of operating solar heating systems involves variable efficiency depending on operating conditions. This problem is more pronounced in hybrid energy systems, where a solar installation cooperates with other segments based on conventional carriers of energy or renewable sources of energy. The operating cost of each segment of a hybrid system depends mainly on the resulting efficiency of solar installation. For over 40 years, the procedures of testing solar collectors have been undergoing development, testing, comparison and verification in order to create a procedure that would allow determining the thermal behavior of a solar collector without performing expensive and complicated experimental tests, usually based on the steady state condition. The proper determination of the static and dynamic properties of a solar collector is of key significance, as they constitute a basis for the design of a solar heating installation, as well as a control system. It is therefore important to conduct simulating and operating tests enabling the performance of a comparative analysis intended to indicate the degree to which the static and dynamic properties of a solar collector depend on the method used for their determination. The paper compares the static and dynamic properties of a flat solar collector determined by means of various methods. Based on the produced results, it has been concluded that the static and dynamic properties of a collector determined using various methods may differ from each other even by 50%. This means that it is possible to increase the efficiency of a solar heating installation via the use of an adaptive control algorithm, enabling real-time calculation of the values of characteristic parameters of solar installation, e.g., the time constant under operating conditions.
