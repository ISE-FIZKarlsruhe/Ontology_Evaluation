The integrated energy system is a vital part of distributed energy industries. In addition to this, the optimal economic dispatch model, which takes into account the complementary coordination of multienergy, is an important research topic. Considering the constraints of power balance, energy supply equipment, and energy storage equipment, a basic model of optimal economic dispatch of an integrated energy system is established. On this basis, a multiobjective function solving algorithm of NSGA-II, based on tent map chaos optimization, is proposed. The proposed model and algorithm are applied. The simulation results show that the optimal economic scheduling model of the integrated energy system established in this paper can provide a more economic system operation scheme and reduce the operation cost and risks associated with an integrated energy system. The Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II) multiobjective function solving algorithm, based on tent map chaos optimization, has better performance and efficiency.
