The increase in mining depth causes the temperature of the coal seam to rise. Studying the effect of temperature on the mechanical property of coal is very necessary. In this paper, based on the results of conventional triaxial compression experiments of coal samples, the discrete element program PFC2D was used to conduct a conventional triaxial compression simulation of coal samples to obtain microscopic parameters. On this basis, the conventional triaxial simulation study of coal samples at different temperatures was carried out to explore the influence of temperature on the physical and mechanical properties of coal. In this process, acoustic emission and energy monitoring were carried out. The damage and failure process of coal is divided into three stages: the undamaged stage, the stable damage stage, and the rapid damage stage. The relationship between acoustic emission characteristic law, energy transformation law, and crack evolution in the damage and failure process of coal was analyzed in detail. The results indicate that the fracture evolution is affected by the increase in cross-sectional area and the decrease in distance between particles due to the expansion of particles, which corresponds to the phenomenon that the temperature increase produces new microcracks and the particles expand to fill the original cracks in the experiment. This indicates that PFC2D can be used as an effective numerical method for a coal mesoscopic study, and the results of these numerical experiments are also helpful to deepen the understanding of the damage mechanism of coal failure under thermo-mechanical coupling.
