The proportion of the coal and rock masses in different areas of surrounding rocks is quite different when a large-section coal roadway is excavated in gently inclined soft coal seams. Different creep failure occurs in coal and rock masses under high stress, which results in uneven deformations of roadways and difficulties in maintenance. This work studied the belt grooves of the 2103 working face in the lower coal group of the Wulihou Coal Mine. Theoretical analysis and measured geomechanical evaluation were used to analyze the failure causes of the surrounding rocks of the roadway. The failure law of large-section roadways in the gently inclined soft coal seams was studied using finite-difference numerical simulation software. Combined with the results of mathematical analysis, surrounding rocks were divided into regions. Surrounding-rock control schemes for different areas, such as grouting reinforcement, strengthening support, and pressure-relief grooving, were proposed separately and verified by numerical simulations. Strengthening the supports could reduce the deformations of area I, and pressure-relief grooving could control the deformations of area IV. The roadway and support system formed an anchored composite supporting body after grouting reinforcement, which greatly improved the bearing capacity and controlled the deformations of surrounding rocks. The fine on-site application effect and the improved non-symmetrical deformation verified the theoretical analysis, numerical simulations, and control technologies. The results provide a scientific basis and useful reference for similar projects.
