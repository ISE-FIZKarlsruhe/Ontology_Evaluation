Entropy generation and dual solutions are rarely studied in the literature. An analysis is attempted here. More exactly, the present paper looks at the impact of radiation of a micropolar fluid on mixed convective flow containing the titanium alloy Ti6Al4V nanoparticle along with a Riga plate. The study of dual-nature solution for the entropy generation along a Riga surface was not being explored in the literature; therefore, the current model focuses on the dual solutions of this complex nature model. Riga surface is identified as an actuator of electromagnetic in which electrodes are accumulated alternatively. This array produces the behavior of electromagnetic hydrodynamic in the flow field. The transmuted leading equations were worked out through the formula of 3-stage Lobatto IIIA. Influences of exercising enormous parameters on temperature distribution, velocity, and micro rotation fields are portrayed and argued. More than one solution is achieved in opposing flow, while in the phenomenon of assisting flow result is unique. Moreover, due to the micropolar parameter, the separation of the boundary layer is decelerating. It is determined that the entire structure produces the dual-nature solution of the phenomenon of stagnation point flow, and the temperature profile behavior shows the significant enhancement in the thermal conductivity due to the addition of the nanoparticle. The results exposed that liquid velocity is enhanced, and micro rotation is decelerated, by improving the values of Hartmann numbers in both solutions, whereas the temperature field is decelerated in the first solution and accelerated in the second solution.
