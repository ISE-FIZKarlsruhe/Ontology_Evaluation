 abstract = {Novel profile control agents are constantly emerging in the field of enhanced oil recovery, contributing to the extension of a stable production period. However, evaluation performed through conventional core flow experiments is usually inadequate to reveal the in-depth mechanism of profile control agents. Besides, due to different operation and production modes, there is an urgent need for a specific experimental method applicable to horizontal wells in bottom water reservoirs. In this context, this paper describes two models tailored to bottom water reservoirs and investigates the flow characteristics and mechanisms of three water-shutoff agent types. At the pore scale, further study was carried out on the water-shutoff synergism between a gel and an emulsifier. The results show that the gel is present at the edge of the pore body, while the emulsion is blocked in the center of the pore body. Hence, gel that enters a water channel (main flow and accumulation area of emulsion) can cooperate with an emulsion to achieve high-strength water shutoff, making the bottom water that re-invades mainly break through at oil-rich areas. Compared with water shutoff with gel alone (randomly distributed in the breakthrough area), the synergism improves the gel’s ability to select flow channels, inhibits emulsifier channeling, and achieves a remarkable EOR effect.},

 abstract = {The proportion of the coal and rock masses in different areas of surrounding rocks is quite different when a large-section coal roadway is excavated in gently inclined soft coal seams. Different creep failure occurs in coal and rock masses under high stress, which results in uneven deformations of roadways and difficulties in maintenance. This work studied the belt grooves of the 2103 working face in the lower coal group of the Wulihou Coal Mine. Theoretical analysis and measured geomechanical evaluation were used to analyze the failure causes of the surrounding rocks of the roadway. The failure law of large-section roadways in the gently inclined soft coal seams was studied using finite-difference numerical simulation software. Combined with the results of mathematical analysis, surrounding rocks were divided into regions. Surrounding-rock control schemes for different areas, such as grouting reinforcement, strengthening support, and pressure-relief grooving, were proposed separately and verified by numerical simulations. Strengthening the supports could reduce the deformations of area I, and pressure-relief grooving could control the deformations of area IV. The roadway and support system formed an anchored composite supporting body after grouting reinforcement, which greatly improved the bearing capacity and controlled the deformations of surrounding rocks. The fine on-site application effect and the improved non-symmetrical deformation verified the theoretical analysis, numerical simulations, and control technologies. The results provide a scientific basis and useful reference for similar projects.},

 abstract = {Polyurethane foam (PUF) is actively used for thermal insulation. The main characteristic of thermal insulation is effective thermal conductivity. We studied the effective thermal conductivity of six samples of PUF with different types and sizes of cells. In the course of the research, heat was supplied to the foam using an induction heater in three different positions: above, below, or from the side of the foam. The studies were carried out in the temperature range from 30 to 100 °C. The research results showed that for all positions of the heater, the parameter that makes the greatest contribution to the change in thermal conductivity is the cell size. Two open-cell foam samples of different sizes (d = 3.1 mm and d = 0.725 mm) have thermal conductivity values of 0.0452 and 0.0287 W/m⸱K, respectively, at 50 °C. In the case of similar cell sizes for any position of the heater, the determining factor is the type of cells. Mixed-cell foam (d = 3.28 mm) at 50 °C has a thermal conductivity value of 0.0377 W/m⸱K, and open-cell foam (d = 3.1 mm) at the same temperature has a thermal conductivity value of 0.0452 W/m⸱K. The same foam sample shows different values of effective thermal conductivity when changing the position of the heater. When the heater is located from below the foam, for example, mixed-cell foam (d = 3.4 mm) has higher values of thermal conductivity (0.0446 W/m⸱K), than if the heater is located from above (0.0390 W/m⸱K). There are different values of the effective thermal conductivity in the upper and lower parts of the samples when the heater is located from the side of the foam. At 80 °C the difference is 40% for the open-cell foam (d = 3.1 mm).},

 abstract = {The increase in mining depth causes the temperature of the coal seam to rise. Studying the effect of temperature on the mechanical property of coal is very necessary. In this paper, based on the results of conventional triaxial compression experiments of coal samples, the discrete element program PFC2D was used to conduct a conventional triaxial compression simulation of coal samples to obtain microscopic parameters. On this basis, the conventional triaxial simulation study of coal samples at different temperatures was carried out to explore the influence of temperature on the physical and mechanical properties of coal. In this process, acoustic emission and energy monitoring were carried out. The damage and failure process of coal is divided into three stages: the undamaged stage, the stable damage stage, and the rapid damage stage. The relationship between acoustic emission characteristic law, energy transformation law, and crack evolution in the damage and failure process of coal was analyzed in detail. The results indicate that the fracture evolution is affected by the increase in cross-sectional area and the decrease in distance between particles due to the expansion of particles, which corresponds to the phenomenon that the temperature increase produces new microcracks and the particles expand to fill the original cracks in the experiment. This indicates that PFC2D can be used as an effective numerical method for a coal mesoscopic study, and the results of these numerical experiments are also helpful to deepen the understanding of the damage mechanism of coal failure under thermo-mechanical coupling.},

 abstract = {High current rate charging causes inevitable severe heat generation, thermal inconsistency, and even thermal runaway of lithium-ion batteries. Concerning this, a liquid cooling plate comprising a multi-stage Tesla valve (MSTV) configuration with high recognition in microfluidic applications was proposed to provide a safer temperature range for a prismatic-type lithium-ion battery. Meanwhile, a surrogate model with the objectives of the cooling performance and energy cost was constructed, and the impact of some influential design parameters was explored through the robustness analysis of the model. On this basis, the multi-objective optimization design of the neighborhood cultivation genetic algorithm (NCGA) was carried out. The obtained results demonstrated that if the MSTV channel was four channels, the valve-to-valve distance was 14.79 mm, and the thickness was 0.94 mm, the cold plate had the most effective cooling performance and a lower pumping power consumption. Finally, the optimization results were verified by a numerical simulation and an experiment, and the performance evaluation was compared with the traditional serpentine channel. The results reported that the optimized design reduced the maximum temperature and standard surface standard deviation of the cold plate by 26% and 35%, respectively. The additional pump power consumption was 17.3%. This research guides the design of battery thermal management systems to improve efficiency and energy costs, especially under the high current rate charging conditions of lithium-ion batteries.},

 abstract = {The Fengcheng Formation in the Mahu Sag of the Junggar Basin, China, is characterized by alkaline lake deposits, featuring abundant alkaline minerals. The content of alkaline minerals affects the physical properties and oil-bearing properties of the reservoir, and existing mineral inversion methods cannot calculate the content of alkaline minerals. Based on Litho Scanner Log data, we can calculate the dry weight of elements using the oxide closure model. By improving the rock volume physical model; adding trona, shortite, eitelite, and reedmergnerite to the rock volume physical model; and combining with the least squares method, the mineral content calculation was carried out, using the inversion method of combination models (Shortite Model, Eitelite Model, Reedmergnerite Model, and Trona Model) to achieve mineral inversion of alkali-bearing shale oil reservoirs. Litho Scanner Log is expensive, and its widespread application will increase exploration costs. This article scales the mineral inversion results of Litho Scanner Log into conventional log data, improves the rock volume physical model of conventional log, and uses a combination model to achieve mineral inversion of alkali-bearing shale oil reservoirs in conventional log. Compared with the results of X-ray diffraction experiments, the average absolute error of all minerals except for trona and feldspar is less than 10%, and the inversion results are consistent with the core test results. The research results of this article can provide theoretical and technical support for the log evaluation of alkali-bearing shale oil reservoirs.},

In this regard, three primary renewable energy sources—wind, solar, and geothermal—are selected. Accordingly, a thorough investigation of the related research published and the trend of evolutions between 2013 and 2023 is carried out for Reverse Osmosis (RO), Multistage flash (MSF), and Multi-effect distillation (MED)-based water desalination facilities coupled with renewable energy sources. In our investigation, we particularly focus on performance indicators, energy efficiency, economic factors, and environmental effects. Also, the associated challenges of these hybrid systems, such as technological complexity, unpredictability, and intermittency, are addressed. Prospects for the future that address these issues and the prospects of using renewable energy in water desalination technologies are also covered.},

 abstract = {This study investigates the impact of nanomaterials on different surfactant solutions. By measuring the parameters (including emulsification property, zeta potential, DLS, CA, IFT, etc.) of imbibition liquid system with nanoparticles and without nanoparticles, combining with imbibition experiments, the law and mechanism of improving the imbibition recovery of nanomaterials were obtained. The findings demonstrate that the nano-silica sol enhances the emulsification and dispersion of crude oil in the surfactant system, resulting in smaller and more uniform particle sizes for emulsified oil droplets. Non-ionic surfactant AEO-7 has the best effect under the synergistic action of nanomaterials. Zeta potential and DLS tests also showed that AEO-7 exhibits smaller particle sizes due to their insignificant electrostatic interaction with nanoparticles. Furthermore, the addition of nanomaterials enhances the hydrophilicity of core and reduces the interfacial tension. Under the synergistic action of nanoparticles, AEO-7 still showed the best enhanced core hydrophilicity (CA 0.61° after imbibition) and the lowest interfacial tension (0.1750 mN·m−1). In the imbibition experiment, the imbibition recovery of the system with nanomaterials is higher than that of the non-nanomaterials. The mixed system of AEO-7 and nano-silica sol ZZ-1 has the highest imbibition recovery (49.27%). Combined with the experiments above, it shows that nanomaterials have a good effect on enhancing the recovery rate of tight core, and the synergistic effect of non-ionic surfactant AEO-7 with nanomaterials is the best. Moreover, nanomaterials reduce adhesion work within the system while improving spontaneous imbibition recovery. These findings provide theoretical guidance for better understanding the mechanism behind nanomaterial-induced imbibition enhancement as well as improving tight oil’s imbibition recovery.},

 abstract = {In order to further understand the complex spatial distribution caused by the extremely strong heterogeneity of buried hill reservoirs, this paper proposes a new method for predicting the development pattern of buried hill reservoirs based on the traditional pre-drilling prediction and post-drilling evaluation methods that mainly rely on seismic, logging, and core data, which are difficult to meet the timeliness and accuracy of drilling operations. Firstly, the box method and normalization formula are used to process and normalize the abnormal data of element logging and engineering logging, and then the stepwise regression analysis method is used to optimize the sensitive parameters of element logging and engineering logging. The Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) algorithm, deep neural network (DNN), and support vector machine (SVM) are used to establish a new method for predicting the development pattern of buried hill reservoirs. Lastly, a comprehensive evaluation index F1 score for the model is established to evaluate the prediction model for the development pattern of buried hill reservoirs. The F1 score value obtained from this model’s comprehensive evaluation index indicates that the LightGBM model achieves the highest accuracy, with 96.7% accuracy in identifying weathered zones and 95.8% accuracy in identifying interior zones. The practical application demonstrates that this method can rapidly and accurately predict the development mode of buried hill reservoirs while providing a new approach for efficient on-site exploration and decision-making in oil and gas field developments. Consequently, it effectively promotes exploration activities as well as enhances the overall process of oil and gas reservoir exploration.},

An effective technical solution to address this requirement is using a parabolic trough solar collector (PTC) in conjunction with a Rankine cycle (RC) heat engine. The solar-powered Rankine cycle (SPRC) system is a renewable energy technology that can be relied upon for its high efficiency and produces clean energy output. This study describes developing a SPRC system specifically for electricity generation in Aden, Yemen. The system comprises parabolic trough collectors, a thermal storage tank, and a Rankine cycle. A 4E analysis of this system was theoretically investigated, and the effects of various design conditions, namely the boiler’s pinch point temperature and steam extraction from the high-pressure turbine, steam extraction from the intermediate-pressure turbine, and condenser temperature, were studied. Numerical simulations showed that the system produces a 50 MW net. The system’s exergetic and energy efficiencies are 30.7% and 32.4%. The planned system costs 2509 USD/h, the exergoeconomic factor is 79.43%, and the system’s energy cost is 50.19 USD/MWh. The system has a 22.47 kg/MWh environmental carbon footprint. It is also observed that the performance of the cycle is greatly influenced by climatic circumstances. Raising the boiler’s pinch point temperature decreases the system’s performance and raises the environmental impact.},

In contrast to this environment, there is a market with imperfect competition. In this market, the price can be affected by some players in the generation/demand side (i.e., suppliers and/or buyers). In the economic literature, “market power” refers to a company that has the power to affect prices. In fact, market power is often defined as the ability to divert prices from competitive levels. In the electricity market, especially because of the integration of intermittent renewable energy resources (RESs) along with the inflexibility of demand, there are levels of market power on the supply side. Hence, implementation of demand response (DR) programs is necessary to increase the flexibility of the demand side to deal with the intermittency of renewable generations and at the same time tackle the market power of the supply side. This paper uses economic theories and mathematical formulations to develop a flexible responsive load economic model (FRLEM) based on real-time pricing (RTP) to show modification of the load profile and mitigation of the energy costs for an industrial zone.

More exactly, the present paper looks at the impact of radiation of a micropolar fluid on mixed convective flow containing the titanium alloy Ti6Al4V nanoparticle along with a Riga plate. The study of dual-nature solution for the entropy generation along a Riga surface was not being explored in the literature; therefore, the current model focuses on the dual solutions of this complex nature model. Riga surface is identified as an actuator of electromagnetic in which electrodes are accumulated alternatively. This array produces the behavior of electromagnetic hydrodynamic in the flow field. The transmuted leading equations were worked out through the formula of 3-stage Lobatto IIIA. Influences of exercising enormous parameters on temperature distribution, velocity, and micro rotation fields are portrayed and argued. More than one solution is achieved in opposing flow, while in the phenomenon of assisting flow result is unique. Moreover, due to the micropolar parameter, the separation of the boundary layer is decelerating. It is determined that the entire structure produces the dual-nature solution of the phenomenon of stagnation point flow, and the temperature profile behavior shows the significant enhancement in the thermal conductivity due to the addition of the nanoparticle. The results exposed that liquid velocity is enhanced, and micro rotation is decelerated, by improving the values of Hartmann numbers in both solutions, whereas the temperature field is decelerated in the first solution and accelerated in the second solution.},

A significant number of pipes would be underground; it is of immediate concern to identify and analyse the level of corrosion and assess the quality of a pipe. Therefore, this study intends to present the development of an intelligent model that predicts the condition of crude oil pipeline cantered on specific factors such as metal loss anomalies (over length, width and depth), wall thickness, weld anomalies and pressure flow. The model is developed using Feed-Forward Back Propagation Network (FFBPN) based on historical inspection data from oil and gas fields. The model was trained using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm by changing the number of hidden neurons to achieve promising results in terms of maximum Coefficient of determination (R2) value and minimum Mean Squared Error (MSE). It was identified that a strong R2 value depends on the number of hidden neurons. The model developed with 16 hidden neurons accurately predicted the Estimated Repair Factor (ERF) value with an R2 value of 0.9998. The remaining useful life (RUL) of a pipeline is estimated based on the metal loss growth rate calculations. The deterioration profiles of considered factors are generated to identify the individual impact on pipeline condition. The proposed FFBPN was validated with other published models for its robustness and it was found that FFBPN performed better than the previous approaches. The deterioration curves were generated and it was found that pressure has major negative affect on pipeline condition and weld girth has a minor negative affect on pipeline condition. This study can help petroleum and natural gas industrial operators assess the life condition of existing pipelines and thus enhances their inspection and rehabilitation forecasting.},

For over 40 years, the procedures of testing solar collectors have been undergoing development, testing, comparison and verification in order to create a procedure that would allow determining the thermal behavior of a solar collector without performing expensive and complicated experimental tests, usually based on the steady state condition. The proper determination of the static and dynamic properties of a solar collector is of key significance, as they constitute a basis for the design of a solar heating installation, as well as a control system. It is therefore important to conduct simulating and operating tests enabling the performance of a comparative analysis intended to indicate the degree to which the static and dynamic properties of a solar collector depend on the method used for their determination. The paper compares the static and dynamic properties of a flat solar collector determined by means of various methods. Based on the produced results, it has been concluded that the static and dynamic properties of a collector determined using various methods may differ from each other even by 50%. This means that it is possible to increase the efficiency of a solar heating installation via the use of an adaptive control algorithm, enabling real-time calculation of the values of characteristic parameters of solar installation, e.g., the time constant under operating conditions.},

 abstract = {The results of optimisation calculations presented in the article are related to longitudinally finned tubes of a heat pump evaporator operating under natural wind-induced flow of outdoor air conditions. The finned surface is characterised by an unusual, wavy fin shape. The article presents the methodology applied to seeking optimal geometric parameters of the finned tube in which thermal calculations were performed by modelling a mixed convection process on the finned surface using the finite volume method. In the case of maximising the heat flow with the minimum mass of the fins, the optimal solution was dominated by the minimum mass of the fins and thus geometric parameters correspond to the number of fins n = 6, fin height h = 0.065 and fin thickness s = 0.0015 m. Optimisation calculations made for maximum efficiency of the exchanger at constant mass indicated that the tube with ten fins (n = 10) with a height of h = 0.11 m and a thickness of s = 0.0018 m allowed maximum heat flow at the assumed mass of the fins in the exchanger tube model. The article proposes a simplified method of determining the optimal geometric parameters of the profile for any mass and maximum thermal efficiency.},

@article{pr9020207,
 abstract = {The coal to ethylene glycol (CTEG) process has drawn much attention due to the serious conflict between supply and demand of ethylene glycol in China. However, it is inevitably accompanied by the problem of high CO2 emissions. Carbon capture is one of the most promising potential effective ways to address this issue. However, the CTEG process, integrated with carbon capture technology, will lead to energy and economic penalties. Thus, a comprehensive evaluation of CTEG process with different CO2 capture technologies is urgently needed. This study analyzed the technoeconomic performance of four CO2 capture alternatives for the CTEG process: Rectisol, mono-ethanol amine (MEA), chilled ammonia process (CAP) and dimethyl carbonate (DMC) technologies. Results show the energy consumption of CO2 capture of the Rectisol process is the lowest, 1.88 GJ/tCO2, followed by the DMC process, 2.10 GJ/tCO2, the CAP process, 3.64 GJ/tCO2, and the MEA process, 5.20 GJ/tCO2. The CO2 capture cost of the Rectisol process is lowest, CNY 169.5/tCO2, followed by the DMC process, CNY 193.2/tCO2, the CAP process CNY 232.6/tCO2, and the MEA process CNY 250.5/tCO2. As the Rectisol technology has the best comprehensive performance, it is the best option for CTEG industry in comparison with the MEA, CAP, and DMC technologies.},

@article{pr9050762,
 abstract = {The powertrain system is critical to the reliability of a battery electric vehicle (BEV). However, the BEV powertrain is a complex system; it includes the motor, motor controller, power distribution unit, battery system, etc. The failure of any of these components may result in the failure of the entire powertrain system and eventually cause serious traffic accidents on the road. However, how much does each component affect the reliability of the entire system, and which components are the most vulnerable in the entire system? These questions are still unanswered today. To develop a reliability design for a BEV powertrain system, it is essential to conduct detailed research by investigating the most vulnerable component parts of the entire powertrain. In the present study, a fault-tree model of the entire powertrain and its subsystems was developed. Based on this model, the failure rates of all components were calculated first. Then, trends in the reliability indices for the entire powertrain and its components were estimated against BEV service life. From the estimation results, we learned that with increased service time, the reliability of the entire powertrain system is indeed much lower than that of its individual subsystems. Moreover, through comparative research, we found that the battery module is the most unreliable component not only of the battery system, but the entire powertrain system. Additionally, it was interesting to find that the reliability of the motor components was higher than that of other subsystem components, but that the reliability indices for the entire motor were not the highest among all the powertrain subsystems studied in this paper. We believe the findings of the present study will be of great significance to an improved understanding of the reliability design and maintenance of BEVs.},
