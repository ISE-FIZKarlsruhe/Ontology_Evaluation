A mathematical model comprising Darcy Forchheimer effects on the 3D nanofluid flow with engine oil as a base fluid containing suspended carbon nanotubes (CNTs) is envisioned. The CNTs are of both types i.e., multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs). The flow is initiated by an exponentially stretched surface. The impacts of Cattaneo–Christov heat flux along with velocity and thermal slip conditions are key factors in the novelty of the defined model. The boundary layer notion is designed to convert the compact form of equations into the component shape. Appropriate transformations lead to differential equations with high nonlinearity. The final non-dimensional system is solved numerically by a “MATLAB” function known as bvp4c. For both CNTs, different graphical sketches are drawn to present the influence of arising parameters versus related profiles. The outcomes show that higher slip parameter boosts the axial velocity, whereas fluid temperature lowers for a sturdier relaxation parameter.
