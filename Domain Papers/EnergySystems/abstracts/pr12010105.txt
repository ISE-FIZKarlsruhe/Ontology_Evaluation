The Fengcheng Formation in the Mahu Sag of the Junggar Basin, China, is characterized by alkaline lake deposits, featuring abundant alkaline minerals. The content of alkaline minerals affects the physical properties and oil-bearing properties of the reservoir, and existing mineral inversion methods cannot calculate the content of alkaline minerals. Based on Litho Scanner Log data, we can calculate the dry weight of elements using the oxide closure model. By improving the rock volume physical model; adding trona, shortite, eitelite, and reedmergnerite to the rock volume physical model; and combining with the least squares method, the mineral content calculation was carried out, using the inversion method of combination models (Shortite Model, Eitelite Model, Reedmergnerite Model, and Trona Model) to achieve mineral inversion of alkali-bearing shale oil reservoirs. Litho Scanner Log is expensive, and its widespread application will increase exploration costs. This article scales the mineral inversion results of Litho Scanner Log into conventional log data, improves the rock volume physical model of conventional log, and uses a combination model to achieve mineral inversion of alkali-bearing shale oil reservoirs in conventional log. Compared with the results of X-ray diffraction experiments, the average absolute error of all minerals except for trona and feldspar is less than 10%, and the inversion results are consistent with the core test results. The research results of this article can provide theoretical and technical support for the log evaluation of alkali-bearing shale oil reservoirs.
