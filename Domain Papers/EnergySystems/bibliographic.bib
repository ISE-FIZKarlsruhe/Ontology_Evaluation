ABSTRACT = {Ammonia, which has advantages over hydrogen in terms of storage and transportation, is increasingly expected to become a carbon-free fuel. However, the reduction of fuel NOx emitted from ammonia combustion is an unavoidable challenge. There is the report that two-stage combustion with parallel independent jets could achieve Low-NOx combustion under ammonia/methane co-firing conditions. In order to further improve NOx reduction, we experimentally evaluated the effects of secondary air nozzle parameters, such as nozzle diameter and nozzle locations, on combustion characteristics in two-stage combustion of ammonia/natural gas co-firing using parallel independent jets. As a result of the experiments under various secondary air nozzle conditions, it was found that under the conditions where NOx was significantly reduced, the peak temperature in the furnace was observed at 300–500 mm in the axial direction from the burner, and then the temperature decreased toward the downstream of the furnace. We assumed that this temperature distribution reflected the mixing conditions of the fuel and secondary air and estimated the combustion conditions in the furnace. It was confirmed that the two-stage combustion was effective in reducing NOx by forming a fuel rich region near the downstream of the burner, and the lean combustion of the unburned portion of the first stage combustion with secondary air. We confirmed that the low NOx effects could be achieved by two-stage combustion using independent jets from the same wall under appropriate combustion and air nozzle conditions.},

ABSTRACT = {Methanol steam reforming (MSR) is considered an effective method for hydrogen storage and to generate high-quality hydrogen for fuel cells. In this work, a comprehensive investigation of the methanol steam reforming process using a bimetallic Pt–Rh and Cu–Ni based on different oxide supports is presented. Highly dispersed titania and zirconia doped with indium and niobium ions were synthesized by sol–gel method. The effect of the nature and quantity of the dopant cation (In, Nb) on the catalytic performance of titania supported metal catalysts was investigated. The conclusions obtained show a significant effect of both the metal alloy and the oxide support nature on the activity and selectivity of the methanol steam reforming process. Pt–Rh alloy catalyst shows higher hydrogen yield, but its selectivity in the MSR process is lower than for the catalysts containing the Cu0.8-Ni0.2 alloy. Heterovalent indium doping of titania leads to the catalytic activity increase. It was suggested that this is due to the defects formation in the oxygen TiO2 sublattice. On the contrary, the use of niobium oxide as a dopant decreases the catalyst activity in the methanol steam reforming process but leads to the selectivity increase in the studied process.},

ABSTRACT = {Green human resource management (GHRM) determines the green behavior practice of employees and affects the social environment and the realization of “Beautiful China” and “Green Development”. In this study, to explore the impact mechanism of GHRM on employees’ green behavior, employees at all levels in an enterprise were selected to be research subjects and a regulated intermediary model was established, based on social exchange theory and the individual-environment matching theory. This paper investigated the enterprise’s GHRM, personal green behavior, relational psychological contract, environmental knowledge and green values. The results show that GHRM has a significant positive predictive effect on employees’ green behavior, the relational psychological contract plays an intermediary role between GHRM and employees’ green behavior and the intermediary role of the relational psychological contract is regulated by environmental knowledge and green values. These research results explain the relationship between GHRM and employees’ green behavior and provide an important basis for enterprises to implement GHRM practice and promote employees’ green behavior.},

ABSTRACT = {The aim of the present study was to determine how thermal stimulation via electromagnetic microwave radiation impacts the yields of biogas and methane produced by methane fermentation of five selected energy crop species in anaerobic reactors. The resultant performance was compared with that of reactors with conventional temperature control. The highest biogas production capacity was achieved for maize silage and Virginia mallow silage (i.e., 680 ± 28 dm3N/kgVS and 506 ± 16 dm3N/kgVS, respectively). Microwave radiation as a method of heating anaerobic reactors provided a statistically-significantly boost in methane production from maize silage (18% increase). Biomethane production from maize silage rose from 361 ± 12 dm3N/kgVS to 426 ± 14 dm3N/kgVS. In the other experimental variants, the differences between methane concentrations in the biogas were non-significant.},

ABSTRACT = {In this study, the combustion and emission characteristics of a diesel/methanol/n-butanol blended fuel engine with different pre-injection timings and pre-injection mass ratios were investigated by a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model. The CFD model was verified by the measured results and coupled with a simplified chemical kinetics mechanism. Firstly, the corresponding three-dimensional CFD model was established by CONVERGE software and the CHEKMIN program, and a chemical kinetic mechanism containing 359 reactions and 77 species was developed. Secondly, the combustion and emission characteristics of the diesel engine with different diesel/methanol/n-butanol blended fuels were analyzed and discussed. The results showed that increases in the pre-injection timing and the pre-injection mass ratio could increase cylinder pressure and cylinder temperature and decrease soot, HC, and CO emissions. At 100% load, the maximum cylinder pressures at the start of pre-injection timing from −15 °CA to −45 °CA, were 7.71, 9.46, 9.85, 9.912, and 9.95 MPa, respectively. The maximum cylinder pressures at pre-injection fuel mass ratios from 0.1 to 0.9 were 7.98, 9.10, 9.96, 10.52, and 11.16 MPa, respectively. At 50% load, with increases of the pre-injection timing and pre-injection fuel mass ratio, the soot emission decreased by 7.30%, 9.45%, 27.70%, 66.80%, 81.80% and 11.30%, 20.03%, 71.32%, 83.80%, 93.76%, respectively, and CO emissions were reduced by 5.77%, 12.31%, 22.73%, 53.59%, 63.22% and 8.29%, 43.97%, 53.59%, 58.86%, 61.18%, respectively. However, with increases of the pre-injection timing and pre-injection mass ratio, NOx emission increased. In addition, it was found that the optimal pre-injection timing and optimal pre-injection mass ratio should be −30 °CA and 0.5, respectively. Therefore, through this study we can better understand the potential interaction of relevant parameters and propose pre-injection solutions to improve combustion and emission characteristics.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper presents computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of the flow around a horizontal axis hydrokinetic turbine (HAHT) found in the literature. The volume of fluid (VOF) model implemented in a commercial CFD package (ANSYS-Fluent) is used to track the air-water interface. The URANS SST k-ω and the four-equation Transition SST turbulence models are employed to compute the unsteady three-dimensional flow field. The sliding mesh technique is used to rotate the subdomain that includes the turbine rotor. The effect of grid resolution, time-step size, and turbulence model on the computed performance coefficients is analyzed in detail, and the results are compared against experimental data at various tip speed ratios (TSRs). Simulation results at the analyzed rotor immersions confirm that the power and thrust coefficients decrease when the rotor is closer to the free surface. The combined effect of rotor and support structure on the free surface evolution and downstream velocities is also studied. The results show that a maximum velocity deficit is found in the near wake region above the rotor centerline. A slow wake recovery is also observed at the shallow rotor immersion due to the free-surface proximity, which in turn reduces the power extraction.},

ABSTRACT = {This manuscript investigates the supercritical carbon dioxide (sCO2) power cycle employed in the power block of concentrated solar power (CSP) plants—solar tower—as an alternative for solar desalination, developed with either distillation or reverse osmosis. This concept is investigated as a possible up-scaling of the SOLMIDEFF project, originally based on a hot-air micro gas turbine combined with a solar dish collector. For the upscaled concept, five different sCO2 cycles are considered, chosen amongst the best-performing configurations proposed in the literature for CSP applications, and modelled with Thermoflex software. The influence of ambient conditions is studied, considering two minimum cycle temperatures (35 °C and 50 °C), corresponding to Santa Cruz de Tenerife and Abu Dhabi, respectively. The results show that the low temperatures at the inlet of the heat rejection unit compromise the viability of distillation technologies. On the other hand, the high thermal efficiency achieved by these cycles, especially with the recompression and partial cooling layouts, reduces the specific energy consumption when combined with reverse osmosis (RO), below that of photovoltaic (PV)+RO. Feed-water preheating is explored as a solution to further reduce energy consumption, concluding that its actual interest is not clear and strongly depends on the location considered and the corresponding water quality standards.},

ABSTRACT = {The present work explores the possibility of incorporation of silicon into the crystal structure of Ruddlesden-Popper La2NiO4+δ mixed conducting ceramics with the aim to improve the chemical compatibility with lanthanum silicate-based solid electrolytes. Ceramics with the nominal composition La2Ni1−ySiyO4+δ (y = 0, 0.02 and 0.05) were prepared by the glycine nitrate combustion technique and sintered at 1450 °C. While minor changes in the lattice parameters of the tetragonal K2NiF4-type lattice may suggest incorporation of a small fraction of Si into the Ni sublattice, combined XRD and SEM/EDS studies indicate that this fraction is very limited (≪2 at.%, if any). Instead, additions of silica result in segregation of apatite-type La10−xSi6O26+δ and La2O3 secondary phases as confirmed experimentally and supported by the static lattice simulations. Both total electrical conductivity and oxygen-ionic transport in La2NiO4+δ ceramics are suppressed by silica additions. The preferential reactivity of silica with lanthanum oxide opens a possibility to improve the compatibility between lanthanum silicate-based solid electrolytes and La2NiO4+δ-based electrodes by appropriate surface modifications. The promising potential of this approach is supported by preliminary tests of electrodes infiltrated with lanthanum oxide.},

ABSTRACT = {Linear system identification is a well-known methodology for building mathematical models of dynamic systems from observed input–output data. It also represents an essential tool for model-based control design, adaptive control and other advanced control techniques. Use of linear identification is, however, often limited to academic environment and to research facilities equipped with scientific computing platforms and highly qualified staff. Common industrial or building control system technology rarely uses these advanced design techniques. The main obstacle is typically lack of experience with their practical implementation. In this article, a procedure is proposed, implemented, and tested, that brings the benefits of linear identification into broader control system practice. The open-source DCU control system platform with its advanced control framework is used for implementation of the proposed linear identification procedure. The procedure is experimentally tested in the laboratory setting using a unique model of HVAC system as well as in real-world environment in an experimental two storey family house. Testing this novel feature of the control system has proved satisfactory results, while some of them are presented in graphical and numerical form.},

ABSTRACT = {Wind energy has become one of the world’s most renewable energy sources in recent years. It is regarded as a clean energy source because it produces no greenhouse gas emissions. The assessment of wind energy resources is an important step in the development of any wind energy conversion system (WECS). As a result, this article examines the wind energy potential of nine Jordanian wind locations: Queen Alia Airport, Civil Amman Airport, King Hussein Airport, Irbid, Mafraq, Ma’an, Ghor Al Safi, Safawi, and Irwaished. The available wind speed data were implemented using three statistical distribution models, Weibull, Rayleigh, and Gamma distributions, and one traditional estimation method, the Maximum Likelihood Method (MLM). Three optimization techniques were used to assign parameters to each distribution model: Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO), and Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA). To determine the optimal distribution model, the performance of these distribution models was tested. According to the findings, King Hussein Airport features the highest wind power density, followed by Queen Alia Airport, while Irbid features the lowest, followed by Ghor Al Safi.},

ABSTRACT = {In the context of sustainable use of resources, hydrothermal conversion of biomass has received increased consideration. As well, the hydrochar (the solid C-rich phase that occurs after the process) has caused great interest. In this work, spruce bark (Picea abies) wastes were considered as feedstock and the influence of hydrothermal process parameters (temperature, reaction time, and biomass to water ratio) on the conversion degree has been studied. Using the response surface methodology and MiniTab software, the process parameters were set up and showed that temperature was the significant factor influencing the conversion, while residence time and the solid-to-liquid ratio had a low influence. Furthermore, the chemical (proximate and ultimate analysis), structural (Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy) and thermal properties (thermogravimetric analysis) of feedstock and hydrochar were analyzed. Hydrochar obtained at 280 °C, 1 h processing time, and 1/5 solid-to-liquid ratio presented a hydrophobic character, numerous functional groups, a lower O and H content, and an improved C matter, as well as a good thermal stability. Alongside the structural features, these characteristics endorsed this waste-based product for applications other than those already known as a heat source.},

ABSTRACT = {Novel profile control agents are constantly emerging in the field of enhanced oil recovery, contributing to the extension of a stable production period. However, evaluation performed through conventional core flow experiments is usually inadequate to reveal the in-depth mechanism of profile control agents. Besides, due to different operation and production modes, there is an urgent need for a specific experimental method applicable to horizontal wells in bottom water reservoirs. In this context, this paper describes two models tailored to bottom water reservoirs and investigates the flow characteristics and mechanisms of three water-shutoff agent types. At the pore scale, further study was carried out on the water-shutoff synergism between a gel and an emulsifier. The results show that the gel is present at the edge of the pore body, while the emulsion is blocked in the center of the pore body. Hence, gel that enters a water channel (main flow and accumulation area of emulsion) can cooperate with an emulsion to achieve high-strength water shutoff, making the bottom water that re-invades mainly break through at oil-rich areas. Compared with water shutoff with gel alone (randomly distributed in the breakthrough area), the synergism improves the gel’s ability to select flow channels, inhibits emulsifier channeling, and achieves a remarkable EOR effect.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper proposes the design and implementation of inductor-inductor-capacitor (LLC) converters with modules connected in series with the power scan method and communication scan network (CSN) to achieve MPPT and regulate the output voltage for the PV micro-grid system. The Dc/Dc converters includes six isolated LLC modules in series to supply ±380 V output voltage and track the maximum power point of the PV system. The series LLC converters are adopted to achieve high efficiency and high flexibility for the PV micro-grid system. The proposed global maximum power scan technique is implemented to achieve global maximum power tracking by adjusting the switching frequency of the LLC converter. To improve the system flexibility and achieve system redundancy, module failure can be detected in real time with a communication scan network, and then the output voltage of other modules will be changed by adjusting the switching frequency to maintain the same voltage as before the failure. Additionally, the proposed communication scan network includes the RS-485 interface of the MPPT series module and the CAN BUS communication interface with other subsystems’ communication for the PV micro-grid application system. Finally, a 6 kW MPPT prototype with a communication scan network is implemented and the proposed control method is verified for the PV system.},

ABSTRACT = {With the changing world energy structure, the development of renewable energy sources is gradually accelerating. Among them, close attention has been given to geothermal energy because of its abundant resources and supply stability. In this article, a deep borehole heat exchanger (DBHE) is coupled with a heat pump system to calculate the heat supply and daily electricity consumption of the system. To make better use of the peaks and valleys in electricity prices, the following three daily operating modes were studied: 24-h operation (Mode 1), 8-h operation plus 16-h non-operation (Mode 2), and two cycles of 4-h operation and 8-h non-operation (Mode 3). Simulation results show that scheduled non-continuous operation can effectively improve the outlet temperature of the heat extraction fluid circulating in the DBHE. The heat extraction rates of Mode 1 is 190.9 kW for mass flowrate of 9 kg/s; in Mode 2 and Mode 3 cases, the rates change to 304.7 kW and 293.0 kW, respectively. The daily operational electricity cost of Mode 1 is the greatest because of 24-h operation; due to scheduled non-continuous operation, the daily operational electricity cost of Mode 3 is only about 66% of that of Mode 2. After an 8-month period without heating, the formation-temperature can be restored within 4 °C of its original state; 90% recovery of the formation-temperature can be achieved by the end of the second month of the non-operation season.},

ABSTRACT = {Hydrogen is expected to be a next-generation energy source that does not emit carbon dioxide, but when used as a fuel, the issue is the increase in the amount of NOx that is caused by the increase in flame temperature. In this study, we experimentally investigated NOx emissions rate when hydrogen was burned in a hydrocarbon gas burner, which is used in a wide temperature range. As a result of the experiments, the amount of NOx when burning hydrogen in a nozzle mixed burner was twice as high as when burning city gas. However, by increasing the flow velocity of the combustion air, the amount of NOx could be reduced. In addition, by reducing the number of combustion air nozzles rather than decreasing the diameter of the air nozzles, a larger recirculation flow could be formed into the furnace, and the amount of NOx could be reduced by up to 51%. Furthermore, the amount of exhaust gas recirculation was estimated from the reduction rate of NOx, and the validity was confirmed by the relationship between adiabatic flame temperature and NOx calculated from the equilibrium calculation by chemical kinetics simulator software.},

ABSTRACT = {Lithium sulfur (Li-S) batteries stand out among many new batteries for their high energy density. However, the intermediate charge–discharge product dissolves easily into the electrolyte to produce a shuttle effect, which is a key factor limiting the rapid development of Li-S batteries. Among the various materials used to solve the challenges related to pure sulfur cathodes, biomass derived carbon materials are getting wider research attention. In this work, we report on the fabrication of cathode materials for Li-S batteries based on composites of sulfur and biomass-derived porous ramie carbon (RC), which are coated with multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). RC can not only adsorb polysulfide in its pores, but also provide conductive channels. At the same time, the MWCNTs coating further reduces the dissolution of polysulfides into the electrolyte and weakens the shuttle effect. The sulfur loading rate of RC is 66.3 wt.%. As a result, the initial discharge capacity of the battery is 1325.6 mAh·g−1 at 0.1 C long cycle, and it can still maintain 812.5 mAh·g−1 after 500 cycles. This work proposes an effective double protection strategy for the development of advanced Li-S batteries.},

ABSTRACT = {The structure of an integrated energy system is complex. Thermoeconomics can play a significant role in the analysis of IES because it makes up for the deficiency of traditional thermodynamic analysis and provides new information on the cost and energy conversion efficiency. When using thermoeconomics to analyze the energy efficiency of an IES, one key issue that needs to be solved is how to transfer irreversible loss across thermal cycles, so that the mechanism of system performance degradation can be fully revealed. To this end, an irreversible cost and exergy cost integrated analysis method based on improved thermoeconomics is proposed, in which the cumulative and transmission impact of irreversible loss across thermal cycles is evaluated using linear transformation of <KP> matrix. A case study on a 389MW combined cooling, heating, and power IES demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The proposed approach can reveal the key links impairing the overall energy efficiency and transfer of irreversible loss across thermal cycles. The approach can be extended to various types of IES to provide directions for the assessment and optimization of the system.},

ABSTRACT = {The scavenging process is an important part of the two-stroke engine operation. Its efficiency affects the global engine performance such as power, fuel consumption, and pollutant emissions. Slow speed marine diesel engines are uniflow scavenged, which implies inlet scavenging ports on the bottom of the liner and an exhaust valve on the top of the cylinder. A CFD model of such an engine process was developed with the OpenFOAM software tools. A 12-degree sector of the mesh was used corresponding to one of the 30 scavenging ports. A mesh sensitivity test was performed, and the cylinder pressure was compared to experimental data for the analyzed part of the process. The scavenging performances were analyzed for real operation parameters. The influence of the scavenge air pressure and inlet ports geometric orientation was analyzed. The scavenging process is analyzed by means of a passive scalar representing fresh air in the cylinder. Isosurfaces that show the concentration of fresh air were presented. The variation of oxygen and carbon dioxide with time and the axial and angular momentum in the cylinder were calculated. Finally, the scavenging performance for the various operation parameters was evaluated by means of scavenging efficiency, charging efficiency, trapping efficiency, and delivery ratio. It was found that the scavenging efficiency decreases with the engine load due to the shorter time for the process. The scavenging efficiency increases with the pressure difference between the exhaust and scavenging port, and the scavenging efficiency decreases with the increase in the angle of the scavenging ports. It was concluded that smaller angles than the industry standard of 20° could be beneficial to the scavenging efficiency. In the investigation, the charging efficiency ranged from 0.91 to over 0.99, the trapping efficiency ranged from 0.54 to 0.83, the charging efficiency ranged from 0.78 to 0.92, and the delivery ratio ranged from 1.21 to 2.03.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, the electronic expansion valve (EXV) on the single-tube heat exchange experimental platform was used as a research object. Firstly, the EXVs were selected according to the experimental requirements, and the functional parameters were set. Subsequently, the effective opening ranges of the EXVs were determined by manual control, and the control effects of the EXVs installed at the front and back ends of the test section were compared. Finally, by self-tuning and optimizing the best response curves, the proportional and integral coefficients suitable for the experimental platform were obtained; thus, the automatic intelligent control of EXV based on the proportional integral (PI) control algorithm was realized. From setting EXV functional parameters to realizing PI control, an appropriate experimental system-debugging solution for the whole process could be obtained. Based on the solution, the system stability could be improved, and the transition process time could be shortened. Furthermore, the solution also provided a method to guarantee the accuracy of experimental data and could be applied to the debugging of similar experimental systems.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, based on the coupling calculation of Simulink software and GT-Power software, an Optimizer model method was proposed for a 16V265H diesel engine to study the effects of different ratios of biodiesel (B0, B10, and B20) on the performance of a 16V265H diesel engine at 1000 rpm and 75% load. Firstly, the four parameters of diesel engine power, BSFC, soot emission, and NOx emission were taken as the result variables of the optimization model. Taking the intake and exhaust timing of the diesel engine as the independent variable of the optimization model, the maximum power, minimum BSFC, and minimum diesel engine emission were studied and analyzed. Finally, the performance parameters were comprehensively analyzed to determine the best intake and exhaust valve timing. Moreover, based on the model optimization, the diesel engine’s BSFC and power performance were compared, and the optimal intake timing scheme for the diesel engine with different biodiesel ratios at 75% operating conditions was obtained. The results showed that the maximum power, optimum BSFC, and minimum emissions of the 16V265H diesel engine with different ratios of biodiesel and different intake valve timing angles were also different. Under 75% load conditions, the BSFC reduction rate was up to 6.32%, and the power increase rate was up to 5.87%. In addition, by optimizing the model with B10 biodiesel and the intake valve timing close to 202°CA and the exhaust valve timing close to 98°CA, the diesel engine had the lowest NOx emission; with B10 biodiesel and the intake timing at 180°CA, the diesel engine had the lowest BSFC; and with B10 biodiesel and the intake valve timing close to 179.5°CA, the diesel engine had the maximum power. In conclusion, the diesel engine is best with B10 biodiesel. This research method can provide a reference for implementing variable intake system technology for the 16V265H diesel engine.},

ABSTRACT = {The application of a machine learning (ML) model to bio-electrochemical anaerobic digestion (BEAD) is a future-oriented approach for improving process stability by predicting performances that have nonlinear relationships with various operational parameters. Five ML models, which included tree-, regression-, and neural network-based algorithms, were applied to predict the methane yield in BEAD reactor. The results showed that various 1-step ahead ML models, which utilized prior data of BEAD performances, could enhance prediction accuracy. In addition, 1-step ahead with retraining algorithm could improve prediction accuracy by 37.3% compared with the conventional multi-step ahead algorithm. The improvement was particularly noteworthy in tree- and regression-based ML models. Moreover, 1-step ahead with retraining algorithm showed high potential of achieving efficient prediction using pH as a single input data, which is plausibly an easier monitoring parameter compared with the other parameters required in bioprocess models.},

ABSTRACT = {In order to better evaluate the effects of ethanol/diesel blends on engine combustion and emission characteristics, we developed an engine cylinder model using the software CONVERGE combined with the program CHEMKIN. The model was validated experimentally. A modified chemical kinetic mechanism was used to calculate the combustion process of diesel fuel and ethanol for the diesel engine, including 154 reactions and 68 species. Furthermore, the influence of different ethanol proportions on diesel engine combustion and emission characteristics, including power, brake specific fuel consumption, brake thermal efficiency, cylinder pressure, cylinder temperature, nitrogen oxide (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), and soot emissions, was also investigated. Our results showed that cylinder pressure and temperature increased with increased ethanol content. When the ethanol content increased to 20% at 100% load, the cylinder pressure increased by 0.46%, and the thermal efficiency increased by 3.63%. However, due to the lower calorific value of ethanol, the power decreased by 4.12%, and the brake specific fuel consumption increased by 4.23%. In addition, the ethanol/diesel blends significantly reduced CO and soot emissions. Compared with diesel, soot and CO emissions from the D80E20 at 100% load reduced by 63.25% and 17.24%, respectively. However, NOx emission increased by 1.39%.},

ABSTRACT = {In the development of natural gas reservoirs, the water produced in wells will cause a decline in gas well productivity. In this study, a selective frozen gel plugging agent system suitable for water plugging in gas reservoirs under conditions of high temperature and high salinity. The plugging capacity of the gel system was evaluated. The experimental results showed that: (1) the optimal experimental scheme of the frozen gelling system was as follows: 107 °C with 1.0% AM-AMPS +0.6% p-benzenediol +0.6% hexamethylenetetramine +0.2% thiourea. (2) The optimal injection volume of the system for water phase plugging was 0.5 PV, and the system has an excellent plugging effect at a permeability of 356–3118 mD. (3) The system could also effectively improve the degree of heterogeneity, and the smaller the degree of heterogeneity, the better the improvement effect. (4) The gel system had a good effect on different plugging methods, and the gas medium did not affect the plugging performance. This study provides a sufficient theoretical basis for the exploitation of high-temperature and high-salinity water-bearing gas reservoirs through experimental research, which is of great significance for improving production capacity.},

ABSTRACT = {In the context of the “carbon peaking and carbon neutrality” goal and energy marketization, the City Regional Integrated Energy System (CRIES), as an important participant in the energy market, pursues low-carbon development as its most important goal. Without a reasonable market participation structure and a comprehensive low-carbon evaluation system, it will be difficult to meet the needs of CRIES for low-carbon development in the energy market. Therefore, this paper first proposes a framework suitable for CRIES to participate in the energy market, and under the influence of the operating characteristics of the energy market, proposes an evaluation index system suitable for CRIES’ low-carbon capabilities in the energy market. The analytic network process–criteria importance through intercriteria correlation (ANP-CRITIC) method is used to determine the subjective and objective weights of each indicator, and the comprehensive weight of each indicator is calculated by the principle of moment estimation to achieve a quantitative evaluation of the low-carbon capability of CRIES in the energy market. Finally, taking a CRIES as an example, the analysis verifies that the proposed evaluation model and method can scientifically and comprehensively evaluate the low-carbon capability of CRIES in the energy market. The results show that the CRIES low-carbon capability evaluation results of different market schemes can be improved by up to 24.9%, and a fairer market transaction mechanism can promote the low-carbon development of CRIES.},

ABSTRACT = {Nowadays, there is a great deal of interest in the development of practical optimization models and intelligent solution algorithms for solving disassembly-line balancing problems. Based on the importance of energy efficiency of product disassembly and the trend for green remanufacturing, this paper develops a new optimization model for the energy-efficient disassembly-line balancing problem where the goal is to minimize the energy consumption generated during the disassembly-line operations. Since the proposed model is a complex optimization problem known as NP-hard, this study develops an improved metaheuristic algorithm based on the water cycle algorithm as a recently developed successful metaheuristic inspired by the natural water cycle phenomena of diversion, rainfall, confluence, and infiltration operations. A local search operator is added to the main algorithm to improve its performance. The proposed algorithm is validated by the exact solver and compared with other state-of-the-art and recent metaheuristic algorithms. A case study in a turbine reducer with different parameters is solved to show the applicability of this paper. Finally, our results confirm the high performance of the proposed improved water cycle algorithm and the efficiency of our sensitivity analyses during some sensitivity analyses.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper explores the effects of six different cases of port water injection on the combustion, knock suppression and emissions of a supercharged gasoline direct injection (GDI) engine through numerical simulation. The six different intake port water injection cases included three vertical distances from cylinder center to water injector and two different injection directions. The results showed that cases 2 and 4 allowed more water and air to enter the cylinder and thus suppressed the knock, so the pressure oscillation was small. Case 2 had the largest turbulent kinetic energy in the center of the cylinder, which in turn facilitated the propagation of flame to the cylinder wall and suppressed the knock. The water injection cases shortened the combustion delay period compared to the no water cases. At the same time, the strong low temperature reaction of the end mixture produced a large amount of CH2O that decomposed into HCO. A high concentration and a large area of HCO distribution can predict the occurrence of a knock. In addition, the water injection cases (except for case 6) reduced the in-cylinder soot, unburned hydrocarbon (UHC) and CO emissions compared to the no water cases, but it increased NOX emissions.},

ABSTRACT = {The high-performance control technology of multi-phase motors is a key technology for the application of multi-phase motors in many fields, such as electric transportation. The model predictive current control (MPCC) strategy has been extended to multi-phase systems due to its high dynamic performance. Model-predictive current control faces the problem that it cannot effectively regulate harmonic plane currents, and thus cannot obtain high-quality current waveforms because only one switching state is applied in a sampling period. To solve this problem, this paper uses the virtual vector-based MPCC to select the optimal virtual vector and apply it under the premise that the average value of the harmonic plane voltage in a single switching cycle is zero. Taking a five-phase induction motor as an example, the steady-state and dynamic performance of the proposed virtual vector MPCC and the traditional model predictive current control were simulated, respectively. Simulation results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method in improving waveform quality while maintaining excellent dynamic performance.},

ABSTRACT = {The increase in demand and generator reaching reactive power limits may operate the power system in stressed conditions leading to voltage instability. Thus, the voltage stability assessment is essential for estimating the loadability margin of the power system. The grid operators urgently need a voltage stability assessment (VSA) method with high accuracy, fast response speed, and good scalability. The static VSA problem is defined as a regression problem. Moreover, an artificial neural network is constructed for online assessment of the regression problem. Firstly, the training sample set is obtained through scene simulation, power flow calculation, and local voltage stability index calculation; then, the class imbalance problem of the training samples is solved by the random under-sampling bagging (RUSBagging) method. Then, the mapping relationship between each feature and voltage stability is obtained by an artificial neural network. Finally, taking the modified IEEE39 node system as an example, by setting up four groups of methods for comparison, it is verified that the proposed method has a relatively ideal modeling speed and high accuracy, and can meet the requirements of power system voltage stability assessment.},

ABSTRACT = {Pore size distribution characterization of unconventional tight reservoirs is extremely significant for an optimized extraction of petroleum from such reservoirs. In the present study, mercury injection capillary pressure (MICP) and low-field nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) are integrated to evaluate the pore size distribution of the Chang 7 tight sandstone reservoir. The results show that the Chang 7 tight sandstones are characterized by high clay mineral content and fine grain size. They feature complex micro-nano-pore network system, mainly composed of regular primary intergranular pores, dissolved pores, inter-crystalline pores, and micro-fractures. Compared to the porosity obtained from MICP, the NMR porosity is closer to the gas-measured porosity (core analysis), and thus can more accurately describe the total pore space of the tight sandstone reservoirs. The pore throat distribution (PTD) from MICP presents a centralized distribution with high amplitude, while the pore size distribution (PSD) derived from NMR shows a unimodal distribution or bimodal distribution with low amplitude. It is notable that the difference between the PSD and the PTD is always related to the pore network composed of large pores connecting with narrow throats. The PSD always coincides very well with the PTD in the very tight non-reservoirs with a much lower porosity and permeability, probably due to the pore geometry that is dominated by the cylindrical pores. However, a significant inconsistency between the PSD and PTD in tight reservoirs of relatively high porosity and low permeability is usually associated with the pore network that is dominated by the sphere-cylindrical pores. Additionally, Euclidean distance between PSD and PTD shows a good positive correlation with pore throat ratio (PTR), further indicating that the greater difference of pore bodies and pore throats, the more obvious differentiation of two distributions. In summary, the MICP and NMR techniques imply the different profiles of pore structure, which has an important implication for deep insight into pore structure and accurate evaluation of petrophysical properties in the tight sandstone reservoir.},

This research proposes a framework with algorithms that generates automated malicious commands which conform to device protocol standards and bypass compromise detection. The authors performed attack-detection testing with three different home setup simulations and referred to Accuracy of Detection, Ease of Precision, and Attack Recall, with the F1-Score as the parameter.

ABSTRACT = {The method of plugging while drilling has been one of the commonly used methods to control formation loss during drilling. The damage to materials for plugging while drilling to MWD has become a complex problem. For many years, field engineers had insufficient knowledge of the passing performance of materials for plugging while drilling in measurement while drilling (MWD). In the existing research, the blocking mechanism of materials for plugging while drilling to mud screen during the flow process is still unclear. In this study, we use computational fluid dynamics coupled with discrete element method (CFD–DEM) to investigate materials’ plugging mechanism while drilling. The results show that the migration process of lost circulation materials (LCMs) in the mud screen can be divided into three stages, displacement, retention, and accumulation of LCMs. The blocking mechanism of LCMs on the mud screen comes from two aspects. One is from the bridging of LCMs with larger particle size in the holes of the mud screen. Another source is the difference between the entry speed and the overflow speed of LCMs. The particle size and mass fraction of LCMs and the viscosity and displacement of the fluid affect the flow properties of LCMs from these two factors, respectively.},

ABSTRACT = {The size effect has a significant effect on the mechanical behavior of rock, thereby fundamentally influencing the stability of rock excavations. The main challenge associated with the experimental research on the size effect of fractured rock mass lies in the difficulty of specimen preparation to represent the influence of size and fracture on the mechanical behavior of the rock material. In order to preliminarily explore the feasibility of 3D printing technology in the field of rock mechanics, fractured rock specimens of different sizes and different fracture characteristics were produced using sand powder 3D printing technology. The uniaxial compression test was combined with the digital image correlation method (DIC) technology to study the influence of the size effect on the mechanical properties and deformation and failure of different fractured specimens. The research finds that: (1) The elastoplastic mechanical characteristics of the sand powder 3D printed specimens are similar to soft rock. Specimen size and fracture angle have significant effects on the mechanical properties of specimens. Under different fracture conditions, the uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) and Elasticity Modulus of sand powder 3D specimens should be decreased with the increase of the specimen size, and the size effect has different influences on the specimens with different fracture characteristics. (2) Under different fracture conditions, the crack initiation position and failure mode of specimens of various sizes are affected by the fracture inclination to varying degrees. (3) The size effect of fractured rock mass is closely related to the defect level inside the rock mass. The size effect originates from the heterogeneity inside the material. The research results verify the feasibility of applying sand powder 3D printing technology to study the size effect of fractured rock masses and provide an innovative test method for the size effect test study. Preliminary exploration of the size effect of fractured rock masses provides a powerful reference for related research in this field. The study proves the feasibility of applying sand powder 3D printing technology in similar rock mechanics tests and contributes to understanding the size effect of a fractured rock mass.},

ABSTRACT = {In this study, we analyze gas–liquid interaction characteristics using a heterogeneous two-fluid model to investigate the influence of interphase force on multiphase pump performance. Two-phase transport platforms are used in oil and gas development to eliminate the need for separation equipment and reduce costs. Full-channel numerical calculations were conducted for an axial-flow multiphase pump based on different inlet gas void fractions (IGVFs) and flow rates. The results indicate that the interaction force of each phase is relatively large in the rotor–stator interference region, and the drag, lift, virtual mass, and turbulent dispersion forces increase with an increase in IGVF or when deviating from the design condition (Q = 50 m3/h). The interphase forces (resistance, lift, virtual mass force, and turbulent dispersion) increase considerably in the impeller passage and minimally in the guide blade passage. Under the conditions of small and high flows, the force of each phase changes considerably in the impeller and diffuser passages, respectively. Furthermore, the turbulent kinetic energy in the flow passage corresponds to the change trend of the interphase force, indicating that the interphase force causes energy loss inside a multiphase pump. These results provide essential information for the optimization of the hydraulic design of multiphase pumps.},

ABSTRACT = {It is becoming increasingly difficult to properly control the power consumption of widely dispersed data centers. Energy consumption is high because of the need to run these data centers (DCs) that handle incoming user requests. The rising cost of electricity at the data center is a contemporary problem for cloud service providers (CSPs). Recent studies show that geo-distributed data centers may share the load and save money using variable power prices and pricing derivatives in the wholesale electricity market. In this study, we evaluate the problem of reducing energy expenditures in geographically dispersed data centers while accounting for variable system dynamics, power price fluctuations, and renewable energy sources. We present a renewable energy-based load balancing employing an option pricing (RLB-Option) online algorithm based on a greedy approach for interactive task allocation to reduce energy costs. The basic idea of RLB-Option is to process incoming user requests using available renewable energy sources. In contrast, in the case of unprocessed user requests, the workload will be processed using brown energy or call option contract at each timeslot. We formulate the energy cost minimization in geo-distributed DCs as an optimization problem considering geographical load balancing, renewable energy, and an option pricing contract from the derivative market while satisfying the set of constraints. We prove that the RLB-Option can reduce the energy cost of the DCs close to that of the optimal offline algorithm with future information. Compared to standard workload allocation methods, RLB-Option shows considerable cost savings in experimental evaluations based on real-world data.},

ABSTRACT = {The research on energy conversion and transportation of fuels at a microscopic level is of great significance to the development of industry. As a new alternative fuel, alcohols are widely used in industry and daily life, so it is necessary to investigate the thermophysical properties of them. In this work, seven species of pure liquid alcohols were performed to investigate the microscopic mechanisms of thermal energy transfer by non-equilibrium molecular dynamic (NEMD) method. Firstly, the thermal conductivity of alcohols was calculated and was found to be consistent with the experimental data. Then, the influence of temperature on energy transfer is investigated, the results show that the contribution of convection energy transfer increases and both the inter- and intramolecular terms decrease with the increase of temperature. Finally, the influence of molecular length on energy transfer was investigated at the same temperature, and it is concluded that the contribution of the convective term decreases and the interactive term increases to the total heat flux with increasing the length of the chain. It is worth mentioning that the contribution of intramolecular energy transfer gradually becomes a dominant part of the total energy transfer as the linear chain molecule increases to a certain length and the number of carbon atoms at the intersection point of inter- and intramolecular energy transfer is similar to the turning point of thermal conductivity.},

ABSTRACT = {The proportion of the coal and rock masses in different areas of surrounding rocks is quite different when a large-section coal roadway is excavated in gently inclined soft coal seams. Different creep failure occurs in coal and rock masses under high stress, which results in uneven deformations of roadways and difficulties in maintenance. This work studied the belt grooves of the 2103 working face in the lower coal group of the Wulihou Coal Mine. Theoretical analysis and measured geomechanical evaluation were used to analyze the failure causes of the surrounding rocks of the roadway. The failure law of large-section roadways in the gently inclined soft coal seams was studied using finite-difference numerical simulation software. Combined with the results of mathematical analysis, surrounding rocks were divided into regions. Surrounding-rock control schemes for different areas, such as grouting reinforcement, strengthening support, and pressure-relief grooving, were proposed separately and verified by numerical simulations. Strengthening the supports could reduce the deformations of area I, and pressure-relief grooving could control the deformations of area IV. The roadway and support system formed an anchored composite supporting body after grouting reinforcement, which greatly improved the bearing capacity and controlled the deformations of surrounding rocks. The fine on-site application effect and the improved non-symmetrical deformation verified the theoretical analysis, numerical simulations, and control technologies. The results provide a scientific basis and useful reference for similar projects.},

ABSTRACT = {In order to solve the problem that the fault classification accuracy of the main bearing of the wind turbine is not high due to the unbalanced vibration signal data of the main bearing of the wind turbine under the background of noise, this article proposes a double-layer fault diagnosis model for the main bearing of the wind turbine that combines the auxiliary classifier generation adversarial network (ACGAN) and the deep residual shrinkage network (DRSN). First, the wind turbine main bearing data is sent into the ACGAN to learn the distribution features of fault data, and a particular type of fault data is generated to expand the original dataset to achieve balance conditions, and then the expanded dataset is sent to the DRSN to reduce noise to improve the fault classification accuracy. The simulation results show that, compared with the traditional deep learning model, the model proposed in this article can significantly improve the classification accuracy of the main bearing fault of wind turbines under noise conditions, and also has a strong diagnosis ability in a state of datasets with different loads.},

ABSTRACT = {This study proposes a recognition method based on symmetrized dot pattern (SDP) analysis and convolutional neural network (CNN) for rapid and accurate diagnosis of insulation defect problems by detecting the partial discharge (PD) signals of XLPE power cables. First, a normal and three power cable models with different insulation defects are built. The PD signals resulting from power cable insulation defects are measured. The frequency and amplitude variations of PD signals from different defects are reflected by comprehensible images using the proposed SDP analysis method. The features of different power cable defects are presented. Finally, the feature image is trained and identified by CNN to achieve a power cable insulation fault diagnosis system. The experimental results show that the proposed method could accurately diagnose the fault types of power cable insulation defects with a recognition accuracy of 98%. The proposed method is characterized by a short detection time and high diagnostic accuracy. It can effectively detect the power cable PD to identify the fault type of the insulation defect.},

ABSTRACT = {In order to explore the mechanical response characteristics of fractured sandstone under true triaxial different medium principal stresses, matdem particle flow software was used to study the mechanical response characteristics, fracture mechanism and damage evolution characteristics of sandstone specimens under the conditions of 30 MPa, 40 MPa and 50 MPa respectively. The simulation results are verified by true triaxial test. The results show that under true triaxial stress, the increase of medium principal stress is beneficial to increase the strength of sandstone. The fracture degree of the specimen increases with the increase of the intermediate principal stress, and finally the interlacing macroscopic cracks are formed. When the intermediate principal stress is perpendicular to the fracture strike, the fracture mode of sandstone is that the macroscopic fracture plane is perpendicular to the fracture strike, and the fracture mechanism of sandstone under true triaxial compression is mainly shear failure, accompanied by tensile failure. With the increasing of the intermediate principal stress, the fractal dimension of the fracture of sandstone specimen increases significantly and the degree of fracture deepens. Combined with the true triaxial test results, the rationality of particle flow simulation test is proved.},

ABSTRACT = {The burner-type regeneration diesel particulate filter is one of the most widely used diesel particulate filters. Using AVL FIRE, a 3D model of a burner-type regeneration diesel particulate filter (DPF) was established, and simulation analyses were carried out. The effects of the exhaust parameters (temperature, exhaust mass flow rate, and soot load) and the structural parameters (channel density, inlet/outlet channel ratio, and the length–diameter ratio) on soot distribution (soot mass concentration and soot thickness) were analyzed. The results show that the soot distribution characteristics of regenerative DPF with a burner are as follows: the soot mass concentration first rapidly rises to the maximum value and then rapidly decreases to a low value, and the dust thickness gradually increases with the increase in location. With the increase in exhaust mass flow rate and soot load, soot mass concentration and soot thickness increase. With the increase in temperature, the mass concentration and thickness of the ash decreased. When the temperature exceeds 750 K, soot begins to regenerate. Among the exhaust parameters, the mass flow rate of the exhaust has the greatest influence on the soot distribution. The length–diameter ratio, the ratio of the inlet and the outlet channel, and channel density have little effect on the mass concentration of soot, and the soot mass concentration increases with the increase in channel density. In addition to the length–diameter ratio of 2.1, the soot thickness increases with the increase in the length–diameter ratio, and the rising rate is also accelerated. The thickness of soot decreased with the increase in channel density and the ratio of the inlet and the outlet channels. When the channel density is more than 250, the change in soot thickness is basically the same. When the ratio of the inlet and the outlet channels exceeds 1.3, the change in the soot thickness is basically the same. Among the structural parameters, channel density has the greatest influence on the soot distribution.},

ABSTRACT = {The integrated energy system is the mainstream energy utilization form of integrating a power system, natural gas system and thermal system, which provides a new way to solve the problem of renewable energy accommodation. The integrated energy system includes a variety of energy generation and conversion equipment, and its internal electricity, gas, cooling and thermal systems must balance the multiple energy supplies required by users. The integrated energy supplier (IES) and integrated energy user (IEU), as different stakeholders, pursue the maximization of their own profit. However, integrated energy suppliers should consider their market share and the sustainability of participating in market competition. Based on the constraints of energy access, conversion and accommodation, and the equipment for energy generation, conversion and consumption, we established an energy flow model. Constrained by the dynamic equilibrium of the supply of integrated energy suppliers and the demand of integrated energy users, a Stackelberg game model of integrated energy suppliers and users was established, and the existence of a Nash equilibrium solution of the game was proved. A genetic algorithm was used to solve the Nash equilibrium solution under two conditions aiming at the integrated energy supplier’s maximum profit and target profit. Considering the demand of integrated energy users in different time periods, we analyzed the time-of-use pricing strategy of the integrated energy based on the balance of the energy supply and demand. The results of a case study show that if integrated energy suppliers adopt the time-of-use pricing strategy of maximum profit, the energy load distribution of integrated energy users can be smoothed, and energy utilization and economic benefits of the system can be improved. If integrated energy suppliers adopt the time-of-use pricing strategy of target profit, enlarge the market by limiting their own profit and obtain the purchase willingness of integrated energy users by reducing the energy price, they can have a larger market share, a more reliable profit and a guarantee of long-term participation in market transactions.},

ABSTRACT = {In this study, flue gas heat recovery potential was determined by using the flue gas measurements from boilers of buildings with solid fuel-fired district and central heating systems in Balikesir, Turkey. Potential flue gas heat recovery potential in terms of energy savings were examined. The potential of heating the preheated water and combustion air supplied to the boiler was analyzed. Thus, the efficiency of the heating system was increased, and energy savings were achieved by providing fuel savings. In order to reduce the flue gas temperature in solid fuel-fired boilers, the acidification temperature, fuel properties and excess air coefficient should be known. Below the acidification temperature, corrosion and other adverse effects may occur in the flue and in the heat exchanger. In this study, acidification temperature and fuel and combustion characteristics of coal were taken into account. Generally, seven types of coal are used for heating purposes in Balikesir province. Thus, flue gas heat recovery potential was determined for these seven types of coal. In terms of energy savings, the recovery potential in Balikesir province was calculated to be between 287,706 and 152,780 kW.},

ABSTRACT = {Compared with land wells, the production environment and reservoir depth of offshore oil and gas wells are more complex and shallower. Further, HPHT production fluid there will produce strong temperature and pressure disturbance that affects the wellbore, which easily generates wellbore safety problems, such as wellhead growth and leakage caused by the incompatible deformation of casing and cement sheath. Therefore, obtaining an accurate wellbore temperature and pressure field is the key to implementing a wellbore safety assessment. Based on the gas–liquid two-phase separated method, this paper established an improved calculation model of wellbore temperature and pressure field for offshore HPHT wells. This model also takes into account the heat transfer environment characteristics of “formation-seawater-air” and the influence of well structure. Compared with the measured data of the case well, the error of temperature and pressure calculation results of the improved model are only 0.87% and 2.46%. Further, its calculation accuracy is greatly improved compared to that of the traditional gas–liquid homogeneous flow calculation model. Based on this model, the influencing factors of wellbore temperature and pressure in offshore gas wells are analyzed. The results show that forced convection heat exchange between seawater–air and wellbore is stronger than that between wellbore and formation. Reducing the gas–liquid ratio of the product can effectively reduce wellbore temperature and increase wellbore pressure. The gas production has a significant impact on the wellbore temperature. When the gas production rises from 10 × 104⋅m3/d to 60 × 104⋅m3/d, the wellhead temperature rises from 63 °C to 99 °C. However, due to the mutual influence of friction pressure drop and hydrostatic pressure drop, wellbore pressure increases first and then decreases with the increase in gas production. The improved model can provide a more accurate estimate of the time to reach the rated wellhead temperature. Meanwhile, this model displays accurate theoretical support for the rational formulation of the production plan after the well opening, so as to avoid excessive restrictions on the initial production rate.},

ABSTRACT = {The petrochemical industry is traditionally a high energy consumption industry, thus energy saving in this industry is of great significance in terms of trying to achieve the national goal of “carbon-peak and carbon neutrality” in China. Diesel is one of the main products of petrochemical enterprises. The energy consumption of a diesel hydrotreating (HDT) unit is relatively high due to the high reaction temperature and pressure of HDT reactors. In order to further explore the energy consumption of diesel HDT units under different operating conditions, this paper establishes a full-process simulation based on the kinetics of hydrodesulfurization, hydrodenitrogenation, and aromatics saturation, in Aspen Plus to discuss the effect of different operating conditions on the electricity, steam, and fuel gas consumptions. The results show that with the increase of reaction temperature or reaction pressure, the sulfur content in diesel oil decreases, but the consumption of related utilities and comprehensive energy consumption increases. In addition, this paper also analyzes the energy consumption changes under the operating condition boundaries when the diesel quality is unchanged. When the reaction pressure is 8 MPa and the reaction temperature is 317.5 °C, the comprehensive energy consumption is 5% lower than the energy consumption with the reaction pressure of 6 MPa and the temperature of 320 °C. Therefore, on the premise of satisfying the diesel product quality, the comprehensive energy consumption of the diesel HDT unit can be reduced by increasing the reaction pressure and decreasing the reaction temperature.},

ABSTRACT = {Coaxial borehole heat exchangers provide a practical method for geothermal energy extraction, but heat transfer efficiency is low. In order to address this problem, three coaxial borehole heat exchangers with vortex generators, based on the enhanced heat transfer theory, are proposed in this paper. The author compared and analyzed the heat transfer performance of three coaxial borehole heat exchangers with vortex generators and those of traditional structures, which explains why the new heat exchanger’s heat transfer mechanism is enhanced. The results demonstrated that the vortex generator can enhance the fluid flow’s turbulent kinetic energy in the coaxial heat exchanger. This generator can also improve the mixing characteristics of the fluid flow and heat transfer. The resultant increase in the inlet flow velocity can decrease the friction coefficient f, increase the Nusselt number and strengthen the coaxial sleeve. As a result, the heat exchange performance of the tubular heat exchanger will also be improved. The thread vortex generator (TVG) heat exchanger outperforms the other three heat exchangers in terms of heat exchange performance, extraction temperature and heat extraction power. The results evidenced that the TVG heat exchanger is better than the smooth tube heat exchanger. The thermal performance coefficient PEC was improved by 1.1 times, and the extraction temperature and heating power were increased by 24.06% and 11.93%, respectively. A solid theoretical foundation is provided by the extracted outcomes for designing and selecting high-efficiency coaxial borehole heat exchangers suitable for geothermal energy extraction.},

ABSTRACT = {The interline power flow controller (IPFC) can control the active power and reactive power of different lines in power system. To utilize the flexible control ability of IPFC and increase the damping characteristic of its controller AC system, this paper proposes a low-frequency oscillation (LFO) suppress method through IPFC. The LFO suppress method is designed by adding supplementary signals to the outer current control loop of IPFC. In addition to adding supplementary active power signals, the reactive supplementary signals are also added to related control loop, which is the total control scheme. To obtain the power system’s small signal model, the identification technology based on the PRONY algorithm is used. In addition, the robust control theory is also applied to make the controllers more adaptive. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, two controllers including both the active and reactive controllers are designed for in PSCAD software. Furthermore, the simulation results prove the proposed method can reach a better control effect and is also of robustness.},

ABSTRACT = {The commutation failure of high voltage direct current (HVDC) systems could lead to unstable operation of the alternating current/direct current (AC/DC) hybrid power grid. The commutation voltage distortion caused by harmonics is a considerable but unclear factor of commutation failure. According to the control switching process of HVDC systems, the commutation voltage-time area method is employed to analyze and reveal the influence mechanism of harmonic components of commutation voltage on first and subsequent commutation failures. Considering the distortion characteristics of AC voltage, a predictive commutation failure suppression strategy considering multiple harmonics of commutation voltage is proposed. In this strategy, the new extinction angle and the zero-crossing offset angle after voltage distortion are calculated considering the harmonic components so as to obtain the compensation margin of the lag trigger angle by combining the correction margin with the voltage change rate. Moreover, the tuning method of parameters of extinction angle and voltage prediction variables are provided. Finally, a case study based on CIGRE standard HVDC system is performed and analyzed by using power systems computer-aided design (PSCAD) software. Compared with the International Council on Large Electric systems (CIGRE) standard test model and traditional commutation failure prevention (CFPREV) control model, the results verify that the proposed strategy can effectively reduce the risk of first and subsequent commutation failures and improve the sensitivity of CFPREV control.},

In this research, to investigate the boundary layer transition of transonic VKI-RG turbine cascade, a noncontact measurement technique named temperature-sensitive paint (TSP) that is capable of quantitatively measuring the surface temperature of a model is used. Under the conditions of outlet Mach number (Ma2) = 0.4, 1.03, and 1.2, the transitional location of a cascade is accurately measured by TSP technique. Moreover, a numerical study on the transitional location of a planar cascade was conducted with the conditions of Mach number (Ma) and attack angle (α). The numerical results show that the transitional location moved forward with the increase in Ma2 and α at Ma2 < 1; otherwise, the transitional location moved backward with increasing Ma2 (Ma2 > 1). Lastly, a strong adverse pressure gradient was formed behind the shock wave, which led to the beginning of the transition.},

ABSTRACT = {In the future, ammonia is expected to become a carbon-free fuel for internal combustion engines. However, the flammability of ammonia is poorer compared to conventional fuels such as gasoline and diesel fuel. Pre-chamber jet ignition may be an effective way to ensure stable ignition and enhance the combustion of ammonia. In this paper, the effects of pre-chamber geometric parameters, including volume and orifice diameter, on the jet ignition and combustion processes were studied using visualization methods, combined with pressure acquisition. The results showed that ignition energy increased and the jet duration was prolonged with the increase in pre-chamber volume, resulting in a higher maximum pressure and pressure rise rate in the main chamber. The jet characteristics of a larger volume pre-chamber exhibited higher stability when the ambient parameters were changed. The smaller volume pre-chamber showed the superiority of a shorter flame propagation distance inside the pre-chamber, which advanced the timing of the jet appearance and shortened the ignition delay when the flammability of the pre-mixture was adequate. The larger pre-chamber orifice diameter caused an earlier jet ignition timing, shorter ignition delay, and higher ignition location. The jet duration for the pre-chamber with a smaller orifice was longer, which was beneficial for increasing the pressure rise rate in the main chamber. Too small a pre-chamber orifice led to ignition failure in the main chamber.},

ABSTRACT = {With the intensification of global environmental pollution and the energy crisis, the new energy EV industry is developing rapidly, and FWID-EV is a popular direction for future vehicle development. For the sake of improving the swing regulate steadiness and safety of EV, the study uses a particle swarm algorithm to optimize and improve the BP neural network PID, and designs an EV steering regulator to regulate the transverse swing torque and slip rate of EV to improve the safety and steadiness of EV steering. The research results display that the maximum value of the transverse swing angular velocity of the regulation algorithm is 0.156 rad/s, that the car slip rate is controlled within 0.046, and the steadiness is high, and that the maximum values of the car torque under the double shift line and snake conditions are 100 N-m and 179.4 N-m, respectively, which can effectively avoid the danger caused by steering. This demonstrates that the improved neural network PID regulator can effectively distribute the steering torque of the EV and improve the steering steadiness and safety of the EV while maintaining the driving dynamics. The use of the improved neural network PID algorithm to achieve the steering steadiness regulation of EV is of great significance to improve the safety of new energy EV, and helps to promote the widespread use of new energy EV.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, a characterization method for a lithium iron phosphate (LFP) pouch cell is presented and evaluated, using a method that applies to hybrid current pulses called hybrid power pulse characterization (HPPC). The purpose of the study is to validate the developed mathematical model capable of offering good results for virtualization of the cell with extrapolation capability for the entire battery. This type of characterization was tested before but on cells with low capacity where relatively small currents were applied. Here, the model is intended to be used for the development of electrical mobility applications, such as electric vehicles (EV) and electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE), where high capacity and currents are required through the cell. The comparison between the real and simulated cell was made with two sets of results obtained from HPPC and using the FTP-72 speed profile by emulating real current conditions, where both show that the method is reliable under the tested conditions and can be used for the considered application.},

ABSTRACT = {Solid oxide fuel cells are an emerging energy conversion technology suitable for high-temperature power generation with proper auxiliary heat. Combining SOFCs and polygeneration has produced practical applications for modern energy system designs. Even though many researchers have reviewed these systems’ technologies, opportunities and challenges, reviews regarding the optimal strategy for designing and operating the systems are limited. Polygeneration is more complicated than any other energy generation type due to its ability to generate many types of energy from various prime movers. Moreover, integration with other applications, such as vehicle charging and fueling stations, increases the complication in making the system optimally serve the loads. This study elaborates on the energy planning and guidelines for designing a polygeneration system, especially for residential applications. The review of polygeneration technologies also aligns with the current research trend of developing green technology for modern and smart homes in residential areas. The proposed guideline is expected to solve the complication in other applications and technologies and design the polygeneration system optimally.},

ABSTRACT = {In the development of high temperature sour gas reservoirs, gas–liquid sulfur two phase percolations exist, which have a significant impact on the gas permeability and gas well productivity. There are currently few reports on experimental studies on gas–liquid sulfur relative permeability. This study improves the experimental equipment and process, and it proposes an experimental method for measuring the gas–liquid sulfur relative permeability curve. Several typical core samples from a sour gas reservoir in Sichuan Basin, China were selected for experimental study, and the gas–liquid sulfur relative permeability under high temperature and high pressure (HTHP) was measured. The results show that, first, the critical flowing saturation of liquid sulfur was 40%, and the gas–liquid sulfur co-flow zone was narrow. With the increase in the liquid sulfur saturation, the gas relative permeability decreased rapidly. Second, the better the physical properties of the core, the greater the damage of liquid sulfur to the core properties. The residual liquid sulfur saturation of the fractured core was higher than matrix core, and as liquid sulfur saturation increased, so did the damage to gas permeability. Third, temperature had an effect on the gas–liquid sulfur relative permeability. Gas relative permeability decreased as the temperature rose, while the liquid sulfur relative permeability remained essentially constant. Fourth, the rock effective stress had a significant impact on the gas–liquid sulfur relative permeability. The relative permeability of gas and liquid sulfur decreased as the effective stress increased, and the fractured core was more sensitive to stress.},

ABSTRACT = {The injection water and formation water in the Mahu oil field have high salinity and poor compatibility, which leads to scaling and blockage in the formation or fracture propping zone during production. In this paper, a scale-inhibiting fracturing fluid system is developed which can prevent the formation of scale in the reservoir and solves the problem of scaling in the fracture propping zone at the Mahu oil field. Firstly, based on scale-inhibition rate, the performances of six commercial scale inhibitors were evaluated, including their acid and alkali resistance and temperature resistance. Then, the optimal scale inhibitors were combined with the fracturing fluid to obtain a scale-inhibiting fracturing fluid system. Its compatibility with other additives and scale-inhibition performance were evaluated. Finally, the system’s drag-reduction ability was tested through the loop friction tester. The results showed that, among the six scale inhibitors, the organic phosphonic acid scale inhibitor SC-1 has the best performance regardless of high-temperature, alkaline, and mixed scale conditions. In addition, SC-1 has good compatibility with the fracturing fluid. The scale-inhibiting fracturing fluid system can effectively prevent scaling inside the large pores in the propping zone, and a scale-inhibiting efficiency of 96.29% was obtained. The new fracture system maintained a drag-reduction efficiency of about 75%, indicating that the addition of the scale inhibitor did not cause a significant influence on the drag-reduction efficiency of the fracturing fluid.},

ABSTRACT = {In view of the working principle of a swashplate axial piston pump, a simulation model of the piston pump was built in AMESim and its output flow pulsation characteristics were simulated and analyzed. We mainly analyzed the influence of the speed of the prime mover, the swashplate angle, the diameter of the piston, and port plate structure on the flow pulsation of the piston pump. The result of this research shows that the port plate structure, the swashplate angle, and the speed of the prime mover have an important influence on the flow pulsation of the piston pump. In order to effectively reduce the flow pulsation generated by the piston pump and reduce the noise generated in the process of flow distribution, the opening of the pre-compression angle and misalignment angle of the port plate of the piston pump must be reduced appropriately and the swashplate angle and the rotation speed of the prime mover should be controlled within a certain range. The flow pulsation of the axial piston pump decreases with the increase of the piston number and the decrease in the misalignment angle. The research results provide a reference for reducing the flow pulsation of the axial piston pump.},

ABSTRACT = {During the process of gas production in high-pressure, high-temperature (HPHT) gas wells, the choke valve, as the most vital component of the surface control equipment, plays a significant role in regulating the output and reducing the fluid pressure to ensure the safety of surface gathering and transportation equipment. High-pressure, high-velocity fluid flow and solid-phase particles cause deterioration of the choke valve. With the enhancement of intelligent and digital oilfields, conventional choke valves have been progressively replaced by electric choke valves. Due to the complex structure of the throttle valve, the flow path and the velocity state of the fluid in the throttle valve, and the distribution law of the erosion fraction are quite distinctive from those in the ordinary throttle valve, meriting further research. In this paper, a simulation of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) was conducted to determine the effects of the pressure distribution, fluid state, divergent particle sizes, and sand volume on the erosion rate of the choke valve. Under various valve openings, the fluid state and the location of high-risk points can be ascertained. The large particle size (diameter greater than 6 mm) of sand and gravel is convenient for causing concentrated erosion in the position of the valve hole, which induces the channel diameter to expand. Fine silt sand (diameter from 0.1 mm to 1 mm) gives rise to relatively uniform abrasion to the choke’s current-facing surface. This study can optimize the layout of the choke valve and reduce the cost and number of switching wells, thereby decreasing the frequency of maintenance and the pressure fluctuation’s effect on the formation.},

ABSTRACT = {Mining sites that combine energy-intensive operations with community living in areas remote from the electricity grid are increasingly developing dedicated micro-grids. Fossil oil gensets hybridization with renewable energy resources has gained momentum. Difficulties in assessing performance are experienced by operators who wish to benefit from improved performances. The designers of such systems also need additional knowledge to anticipate the solutions of the particular problems related to the power plant’s implementation area characteristics. The proposed approach gives more suitable tools on the effectiveness evaluation of hybridized microgrid, combining a Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO) thermal power station with photovoltaic generator powering mine activities in the Sahelian area. The authors provide key analyses and improvement factors by seasonal behavioral modelling (SBM) of the fuel consumption of the gensets related to the overall irradiance dynamics of the PV array. Several years of data analysis results have been integrated for sharper considerations on the transient interactions impact of the PV/Diesel Hybrid Power Plant operation. The results of simulations carried out using the proposed new models, including the case of an extended system with storage unit, have been used to evaluate the levelized cost of energy, and to discuss competitiveness. This very relevant approach provides additional knowledge for designers and energetic effectiveness analysts.},

ABSTRACT = {The most widely applied methods to unlock heavy oil and natural bitumen resources in the world are still based on steam injection techniques. Improving the efficiency of hydrothermal processes poses a great challenge. The co-injection of various additives is practiced to lower the steam-to-oil ratio (SOR), viscosity alteration and to improve heavy oil properties. Organic solvents, non-condensable gases, air and surfactants are the preferred chemicals to be combined with steam. This study provides an investigation of the surfactant-assisted hydrothermal upgrading of heavy oil at 200 °C. The thermal stability and salt resistivity of two non-ionic surfactants (SA–3 and Biolub Green) were investigated. Moreover, the improved performance of the surfactants was established by performing an SARA analysis, elemental analysis, FT-IR spectroscopy, and EPR analysis, and by studying the viscosity reduction degree. The experimental results showed that surfactants lead to the in-depth destructive hydrogenation of the high-molecular components of heavy oil such as resins and asphaltenes. However, the content of light fractions increased. According to the results of the elemental analysis, the surfactants assist in the hydrodesulphurization of heavy oil. Overall, the physical and chemical consequences of hydrothermal upgrading in the presence of surfactants led to the irreversible viscosity reduction of heavy oil.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, a stochastic-metaheuristic model is performed for multi-objective allocation of photovoltaic (PV) resources in 33-bus and 69-bus distribution systems to minimize power losses of the distribution system lines, improving the voltage profile and voltage stability of the distribution system buses, considering the uncertainty of PV units’ power and network demand. The decision-making variables, including installation location and the size of PVs, are determined optimally via an improved human learning optimization algorithm (IHLOA). The conventional human learning optimization algorithm (IHLOA) is improved based on Gaussian mutation to enhance the exploration capability and avoid getting trapped in local optimal. The methodology is implemented in two cases as deterministic and stochastic without and with uncertainties, respectively. Monte Carol Simulation (MCS) based on probability distribution function (PDF) is used for uncertainties modeling. The deterministic results proved the superiority of the IHLOA compared with conventional HLOA, particle swarm optimization (PSO), to obtain better values of the different objectives and faster convergence speed and accuracy. The results are clear that enhancing the conventional HLOA has increased the algorithm’s ability to explore and achieve the optimal global solution with higher convergence accuracy. Moreover, the stochastic results were clear that considering the uncertainties leads to correct and robust decision-making against existing uncertainties and accurate knowledge of the network operator against the exact values of various objectives compared to the deterministic case.},

ABSTRACT = {This study investigated the effect of coal–Scenedesmus microalgae (with blending ratios of 100:0 (coal), 95:5 (Coalgae® 5%), 90:10 (Coalgae® 10%), 85:15 (Coalgae® 15%) and 80:20 (Coalgae® 20%)) on combustion temperature, mass loss, the formation of CO2, SO2 and NOx gases, and ash content under constant atmospheric air flow. Coalgae® refers to a material formed after blending coal and microalgae. The results showed that NOx came mainly from Coalgae® 10% and 15%, and this observation could be attributed to a variable air concentration level (O2 level) in the environment that could influence NOx during the combustion process, irrespective of the blending ratios. CO2 emission reductions (12%, 17%, 21% and 29%) and SO2 emission reductions (3%, 12%, 16% and 19%) increased with the increasing coal-microalgae blending ratio (Coalgae® 5–20%), respectively. Bubble-like morphology was observed in the ash particles of coal–microalgae blends through SEM, while the TEM confirmed the formation of carbon-based sheets and graphitic-based nanocomposites influenced by the microalgae amounts. Ash residues of the coal–microalgae blends contained high amounts of fluxing compounds (Fe2O3, K2O, CaO and MgO), which resulted in an increased base/acid ratio from 0.189 (coal) to 0.568 (Coalgae® 20%). Based on the above findings, the co-firing of coal–Scenedesmus microalgae led to a reduction in CO2, SO2, and NOx emissions. As such, lower Coalgae® blends can be considered as an alternative fuel in any coal-driven process for energy generation.},

ABSTRACT = {Power systems face adequacy risks because of the high integration of renewable energy. It is urgent to develop efficient methods for power system operational reliability assessment. Conventional power system reliability assessment methods cannot achieve real-time assessment of system risk because of the high computational complexity and long calculation time. The high computational complexity is mainly caused by a large number of optimal power flow (OPF) calculations. To reduce the computational complexity, this paper transfers the optimal power flow model as a multiparameter linear programming model. Then, the optimal power flow can be obtained by linear calculations. Furthermore, this paper proposes a state reduction method considering the importance index of transmission lines for further improving the calculation efficiency. Case studies are carried out on IEEE standard systems and a provincial power grid in China. Compared with the conventional reliability assessment method, the reliability assessment efficiency of the proposed method increases by 10–40 times, and the assessment error is less than 1%.},

ABSTRACT = {With their relative ease of production and coupled strong surface functionality and electrical conductivity properties, graphene oxide (GO) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) are exciting, yet overlooked, graphene-like additive prospects for activated carbon (AC) electrodes in supercapacitors. In this work, we incorporated small amounts of synthesized GO and rGO in AC electrodes via a simple mixing procedure to explore their effects. In addition to materials characterizations, symmetric supercapacitors were made from these electrodes and tested across current densities ranging from 0.1–10 A g−1 and across 10,000 additional charge-discharge cycles at 2 A g−1. Performance measurements indicate that GO and rGO enhance the rate resistance and capacity, respectively, of AC electrodes, but these effects are modest and do not prevent increases in internal resistance over the course of 10,000 cycles. The overall ineffectuality of GO and rGO is reasoned to be due to their isolation and infrequency as a result of the relatively impotent distribution method used.},

ABSTRACT = {Natural gas is a viable oil displacement agent in ultra-low-permeability reservoirs due to its good fluidity. It can also cause gas channeling during continuous injection, which limits its oilfield application. In order to relieve gas channeling during natural gas flooding, the injection mode should be changed. The use of intermittent natural gas injection (IGI) after the continuous natural gas injection in an ultra-low-permeability reservoir is proposed, and optimization of the injection parameters is discussed. The results show that IGI can be divided into three stages, the gas injection stage, the well shutting stage and the oil production stage. With the increase in injection time, the oil recovery enhances obviously as a result of IGI because the gas fingering can be controlled at the well shutting stage, and the gas/liquid ratio grows slowly because the gas breakthrough can be reduced at the oil production stage. The oil recovery improves with the increase in cycle time of IGI, while the increase rate reduces evidently after the cycle time reaches 360 min. The oil recovery increment is low if the cycle index exceeds 3 in the ultra-low-permeability reservoir. Thus, the optimal cycle time for each round and the appropriate cycle index of IGI are 360 min and three rounds.},

ABSTRACT = {To simultaneously satisfy the electricity and freshwater requirements, a superstructure of a solar-wind-diesel hybrid energy system (HES) with multiple types of storage devices driving a reverse osmosis desalination (ROD) process is established in this paper. The corresponding mathematical model of the HES, potentially including photovoltaic cells, a wind turbine, a diesel generator, a ROD unit, different battery storage technologies, or a water tank is developed and features mixed integer linear programming. The optimum design and operation schemes of the HES can be obtained by taking the minimum total annual cost as the optimization objective. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, an example of a solar-wind-diesel system for supplying a ROD process in Saudi Arabia is adopted. The results show that a photovoltaic panel, wind turbine, diesel generator, lead-acid battery, Li-ion battery and water tank are selected in the HES with the minimum total annual cost (i.e., 1.16 × 105 USD·y−1), by satisfying the requirement of the renewable energy penetration rate (i.e., 0.8). Then, a quantified method is proposed to determine the optimal design and operation schemes of the HES, including both economic and environmental aspects. Finally, the HES with various generators and multiple types of storage devices shows a better performance in terms of economy and renewable energy utilization.},

ABSTRACT = {Renewable energy is a key technology for achieving carbon-free energy transitions, and solar power systems are one of the most reliable resources for achieving this. Solar power systems have a simple structure and are inexpensive. However, depending on the input irradiance, the existing maximum output control algorithm (P&O) has disadvantages due to its slow transient response and steady-state vibration. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a maximum output control algorithm based on a deep learning algorithm that can predict the input irradiance. This can achieve a quick transient response and steady-state stability. The proposed method predicts the irradiance based on the output voltage/current and power of the photovoltaic (PV) system and calculates the duty ratio that can accurately follow the maximum output point according to the irradiance. The deep learning model applied in this study was trained based on the experimental results using a 100 W PV panel, and the performance of the proposed algorithm was verified by comparing its performance with that of the conventional algorithm under various input irradiance conditions. The proposed algorithm exhibits a maximum efficiency increase of 11.24% under the same input conditions as those of the existing algorithms.},

ABSTRACT = {Ammonia is a promising alternative fuel, which is considered to have the potential to substitute conventional fossil fuels. In the present work, auto-ignition characteristics of ammonia substitution on methane are investigated both experimentally and numerically. The auto-ignition procedure of ammonia-substituted methane/air mixtures are measured behind the reflected shock wave in a shock tube experiment system over temperatures from 1355 to 1877 K, pressure up to 5 atm and an equivalence ratio from 0.5 to 2. Numerical simulation studies using a detailed kinetics mechanism are also performed to gain a deep insight into the auto-ignition procedure of ammonia-substituted methane fuel mixtures. The established numerical model is verified with the measured auto-ignition delay time data by experiments. Then, the auto-ignition delay times are predicted under a wider range of conditions such as equivalence ratio, pressure, temperature, etc. In this way, combustion characteristics of such mixtures are investigated. It is found that adding ammonia fuel to methane will not change the autoignition delay time of methane a lot, while it can effectively benefit the reduction of carbon emissions. Finally, sensitivity analyses are performed to provide essential information for the elementary reaction sensitive to the ignition characteristics. The results present in this work can provide fundamental information for combustion application of ammonia-based fuels.},

ABSTRACT = {An axial flow pump is a kind of high-specific revolution vane pump that has the characteristics of large flow, low head, and high efficiency. Due to its unique properties, it is widely used in large water diversion projects, such as the South-to-North Water Diversion Project. However, during the operation of the pump, some fish enter the axial flow pump together with the water flow through the screen before the entrance of the pump station. Consequently, some fish are inevitably damaged or even die in the process of traversing through the pump. Meanwhile, the decay of dead fish directly affects the quality of water, hence, posing serious ecological pollution and destabilizing the ecological balance. Therefore, understanding the dynamics of axial flow pumps in relation to fish species in water bodies for biodiversity and ecosystem services remain vital for nature conservation. In this paper, the impact of damage of the model pump on fish is exhaustively investigated according to the theory of blade impact model, impact probability, impact mortality, and mortality distribution under different working conditions. Through the simulation of the flow state inside the impeller, the areas that are lower than the pressure threshold, higher than the shear strain rate threshold, and higher than the pressure gradient threshold in the impeller at different flow rates are analyzed. Based on the unsteady results, the volume fluctuation characteristics of the three damage mechanisms in the impeller are analyzed. Furthermore, Powell vortex acoustic equation is used to locate the high noise source region of the axial flow pump. After extensive comparison of the dipole sound source intensity, it is revealed that the dipole noise source in the impeller and guide vane is dominant. In conclusion, this study provides a holistic perspective for evaluating fish damage caused by the flow in the impeller of the axial flow pump. Furthermore, it will proffer significant references to the construction of ecological water conservancy projects.},

ABSTRACT = {The climate change impact associated with greenhouse gas emissions is a major global concern. This work investigates perovskite compounds for oxygen separation from air to supply oxygen to oxyfuel energy systems to abate these significant environmental impacts. The perovskites studied were Me0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Cu0.2O3−δ (MeSCC) where the A-site substitution was carried out by four different cations (Me = Ca, Mg, Sr, or Ba). SEM analysis showed the formation of small particle (<1 µm) aggregates with varying morphological features. XRD analysis confirmed that all compounds were perovskites with a hexagonal phase. Under reduction and oxidation reactions (redox), Ba and Ca substitutions resulted in the highest and lowest oxygen release, respectively. In terms of real application for oxygen separation from air, Ba substitution as BaSCC proved to be preferable due to short temperature cycles for the uptake and release of oxygen of 134 °C, contrary to Ca substitution with long and undesirable temperature cycles of 237 °C. As a result, a small air separation unit of 0.66 m3, containing 1000 kg of BaSCC, can produce 18.5 ton y−1 of pure oxygen by using a conservative heating rate of 1 °C min−1. By increasing the heating rate by a further 1 °C min−1, the oxygen production almost doubled by 16.7 ton y−1. These results strongly suggest the major advantages of short thermal cycles as novel designs for air separation. BaSCC was stable under 22 thermal cycles, and coupled with oxygen production, demonstrates the potential of this technology for oxyfuel energy systems to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases.},

ABSTRACT = {The pump as turbines (PATs) has been widely used in the petrochemical, seawater desalination, and mining industries. Volutes are critical components for flow guidance and energy conversion in the PATs. Therefore, its inner flow characteristic could significantly influence the hydraulic turbine system stability. To reveal the vortex evolution, pressure pulsation characteristics, and the interaction between the two in the volute of PATs, a single-stage cantilever hydraulic turbine is investigated by the numerical and experiment method. The effect of impeller rotation on vorticity distribution and pressure fluctuation intensity in volute is analyzed based on the numerical simulation results. By clarifying the frequency components corresponding to local high amplitude vorticity and pressure pulsations, the relationship between vortex evolution and pressure pulsations is established. The results showed that the dominant frequency of pressure pulsation in the circumferential direction of the volute is 6fn under different operating conditions, and the pressure pulsation characteristics in the inlet section of the volute were less affected by the rotor–stator interaction. Under Qb and 1.3Qb conditions, the vorticity pulsation near the walls in the circumferential direction of the volute had less effect on local pressure pulsation characteristics. The evolution of vorticity at the leading edge of the volute tongue intensified the local pressure pulsations as the flow rate increased. Under 0.7Qb conditions, the vorticity pulsation characteristics in the volute are complex and have a relatively significant influence on local pressure pulsation.},

ABSTRACT = {Hydrogen, as a suitable and clean energy carrier, has been long considered a primary fuel or in combination with other conventional fuels such as gasoline and diesel. Since the density of hydrogen is very low, in port fuel-injection configuration, the engine’s volumetric efficiency reduces due to the replacement of hydrogen by intake air. Therefore, hydrogen direct in-cylinder injection (injection after the intake valve closes) can be a suitable solution for hydrogen utilization in spark ignition (SI) engines. In this study, the effects of hydrogen direct injection with different hydrogen energy shares (HES) on the performance and emissions characteristics of a gasoline port-injection SI engine are investigated based on reactive computational fluid dynamics. Three different injection timings of hydrogen together with five different HES are applied at low and full load on a hydrogen–gasoline dual-fuel SI engine. The results show that retarded hydrogen injection timing increases the concentration of hydrogen near the spark plug, resulting in areas with higher average temperatures, which led to NOX emission deterioration at −120 Crank angle degree After Top Dead Center (CAD aTDC) start of injection (SOI) compared to the other modes. At −120 CAD aTDC SOI for 50% HES, the amount of NOX was 26% higher than −140 CAD aTDC SOI. In the meanwhile, an advanced hydrogen injection timing formed a homogeneous mixture of hydrogen, which decreased the HC and soot concentration, so that −140 CAD aTDC SOI implied the lowest amount of HC and soot. Moreover, with the increase in the amount of HES, the concentrations of CO, CO2 and soot were reduced. Having the HES by 50% at −140 CAD aTDC SOI, the concentrations of particulate matter (PM), CO and CO2 were reduced by 96.3%, 90% and 46%, respectively. However, due to more complete combustion and an elevated combustion average temperature, the amount of NOX emission increased drastically.},

ABSTRACT = {Polyurethane foam (PUF) is actively used for thermal insulation. The main characteristic of thermal insulation is effective thermal conductivity. We studied the effective thermal conductivity of six samples of PUF with different types and sizes of cells. In the course of the research, heat was supplied to the foam using an induction heater in three different positions: above, below, or from the side of the foam. The studies were carried out in the temperature range from 30 to 100 °C. The research results showed that for all positions of the heater, the parameter that makes the greatest contribution to the change in thermal conductivity is the cell size. Two open-cell foam samples of different sizes (d = 3.1 mm and d = 0.725 mm) have thermal conductivity values of 0.0452 and 0.0287 W/m⸱K, respectively, at 50 °C. In the case of similar cell sizes for any position of the heater, the determining factor is the type of cells. Mixed-cell foam (d = 3.28 mm) at 50 °C has a thermal conductivity value of 0.0377 W/m⸱K, and open-cell foam (d = 3.1 mm) at the same temperature has a thermal conductivity value of 0.0452 W/m⸱K. The same foam sample shows different values of effective thermal conductivity when changing the position of the heater. When the heater is located from below the foam, for example, mixed-cell foam (d = 3.4 mm) has higher values of thermal conductivity (0.0446 W/m⸱K), than if the heater is located from above (0.0390 W/m⸱K). There are different values of the effective thermal conductivity in the upper and lower parts of the samples when the heater is located from the side of the foam. At 80 °C the difference is 40% for the open-cell foam (d = 3.1 mm).},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, the co-combustion behavior of the walnut shell, biochar, and coal, and the respective binary and ternary blends were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) in the oxy-fuel atmosphere (21% O2/79% CO2). The combustion reactivity of coal was similar to biochar but lower than that of the walnut shell. The presence of the walnut shell improved the combustion performance of coal and biochar. The interaction between only biochar and coal was inhibited in the binary blends. The presence of the walnut shell in the ternary blend covered up the inhibition between biochar and coal. The average activation energy of each sample was obtained using the Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose (KAS) and Flynn-Wall-Ozawa (FWO) kinetic models. The results of this study provide a reference for the rational utilization of biomass and biochar and the practical improvement of the thermal conversion efficiency of coal.},

ABSTRACT = {In this study, two shale samples with different maturities, from Geniai, Lithuania (Ro = 0.7%), and Wenjiaba, China (Ro = 2.7%), were selected for open-system pyrolysis experiments at 400 °C and 500 °C, respectively. The generation of isotopic gases from the shales with different maturities was investigated, and the effects of pyrite catalysis on the carbon isotopic compositions were also studied. It was found that CO2, CH4 and their isotopic gases were the main gaseous products of the pyrolysis of both shales, and more hydrocarbon gases were generated from the low-maturity Geniai shale. The δ13C1 values fluctuated from −40‰ to −38‰, and δ13C2 showed higher values (−38‰~−34‰) for the Geniai shale. In addition, its δ13CCO2 values ranged from −28‰ to −26‰. Compared with the Geniai shale, lower δ13C1 values (−43‰~−42‰) and higher δ13CCO2 values (−19‰~−14‰) were detected for the Wenjiaba shale. As temperature increased, CH4 became isotopically lighter and C2H6 became isotopically heavier, which changes were due to the mass-induced different reaction rates of 12C and 13C radicals. Furthermore, the pyrite made the kinetic isotope effect stronger and thus made the CH4 isotopically lighter for both shales, especially at the lower temperature of 400 °C.},

ABSTRACT = {Aluminum production is a major energy consumer and important source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions globally. Estimation of the energy consumption and GHG emissions caused by aluminum production in China has attracted widespread attention because China produces more than half of the global aluminum. This paper conducted life cycle (LC) energy consumption and GHG emissions analysis of primary and recycled aluminum in China for the year 2020, considering the provincial differences on both the scale of self-generated electricity consumed in primary aluminum production and the generation source of grid electricity. Potentials for energy saving and GHG emissions reductions were also investigated. The results indicate that there are 157,207 MJ of primary fossil energy (PE) consumption and 15,947 kg CO2-eq of GHG emissions per ton of primary aluminum ingot production in China, with the LC GHG emissions as high as 1.5–3.5 times that of developed economies. The LC PE consumption and GHG emissions of recycled aluminum are very low, only 7.5% and 5.3% that of primary aluminum, respectively. Provincial-level results indicate that the LC PE and GHG emissions intensities of primary aluminum in the main production areas are generally higher while those of recycled aluminum are lower in the main production areas. LC PE consumption and GHG emissions can be significantly reduced by decreasing electricity consumption, self-generated electricity management, low-carbon grid electricity development, and industrial relocation. Based on this study, policy suggestions for China’s aluminum industry are proposed. Recycled aluminum industry development, restriction of self-generated electricity, low-carbon electricity utilization, and industrial relocation should be promoted as they are highly helpful for reducing the LC PE consumption and GHG emissions of the aluminum industry. In addition, it is recommended that the central government considers the differences among provinces when designing and implementing policies.},

ABSTRACT = {The concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has been increasing since immediately after the boom of industrialization. Novel technologies are required for carbon dioxide (CO2) capture, storage, and its chemical conversion into value-added products. In this study, we present a novel in situ CO2 utilization method via a hydrogenation process in the presence of nickel tallates during steam-based enhanced oil recovery. The light n-alkanes are the preferred products of in situ catalytic hydrogenation of CO2 due to their effective solubility, viscosity-reducing capacity, and hydrogen-donating capacity. A nickel tallate was evaluated for its carbon dioxide hydrogenation and oil-upgrading performance at 300 °C. The results showed that the content of saturated and aromatic fractions increased, while the content of heavier fragments decreased. Moreover, the relative content of normal C10–C20 alkanes doubled after the catalytic hydrogenation of CO2. Despite the noncatalytic hydrogenation of CO2, the viscosity was altered from 3309 mPa.s to 1775 mPa.s at a shear rate of 0.66 s−1. The addition of the catalyst further contributed to the reduction of the viscosity, down to 1167 mPa.s at the same shear rate. Thus, in situ catalytic hydrogenation of CO2 not only significantly reduces the concentration of anthropogenic carbon dioxide gas in the atmosphere, but it also enhances the oil-recovery factor by improving the quality of the upgraded crude oil and its mobility.},

ABSTRACT = {We aimed to assess the temporal and spatial evolution law of the freezing temperature field of water-rich sandy soil in underground freezing engineering, taking the newly built west ventilating shaft freezing engineering in the Yuandian No. 2 Mine of Huaibei Coalfield as the engineering background. The influence of groundwater seepage on the freezing temperature field was qualitatively analyzed using field measured data. Based on the mixture medium theory, a hydrothermal coupling numerical calculation model of the freezing temperature field was established. The temporal and spatial evolution law of the freezing temperature field of water-rich sandy soil was obtained via the analysis of field measured data and numerical calculation results. It was found that the proportion of water that froze into ice in the soil mass within the freezing pipe circle is more than that outside of the freezing pipe circle; thus, the phase change in the soil mass within the freezing pipe circle is highly obvious. Groundwater seepage has an “erosion” effect on the upstream and side frozen walls and a “cooling superposition” effect on the downstream frozen wall. Under the effect of groundwater seepage of 2.81 m/d, the average temperature of the effective frozen wall during excavation is below −15 °C, while the thickness is above 5 m for the selected sandy layer at the site, meeting the construction and design requirements. When the groundwater flow rate increases from 0 to 10 m/d, the closure time of the frozen wall increases from 27 to 49 days, an 81.48% increase; the upstream thickness of the effective frozen wall decreases from 5.635 to 4.65 m, which represents a 17.48% decrease, while the downstream thickness increases from 5.664 to 7.393 m, an increase of 30.60%. The numerical calculation model in this paper can be used to predict the development law of the freezing temperature field of the water-rich sandy layers in the Yuandian No. 2 mine and to adjust the on-site cooling plan in real time according to the construction progress. This study provides some theoretical basis and reference for the construction and designs of the freezing temperature fields of water-rich sandy soil layers.},

ABSTRACT = {Power systems have recently faced significant challenges due to the increased penetration of renewable energy sources (RES) such as frequency deviation due to fluctuations, unpredictable nature, and uncertainty of this RES. In this paper, a cascaded controller called (1+PD)-PID is proposed to reduce the influence of RES uncertainties on the system and to maintain the system’s reliability during fluctuations. The proposed controller is a combination of (1+PD) and PID controllers in order. The output signal of the (1+PD) controller along with the frequency deviation and the power difference between adjacent areas are used as inputs to the PID controller to create the load reference signal. The parameters of the suggested controller are optimally tuned using the African Vulture Optimization Algorithm (AVOA) to ensure the best performance of the controller. A two-area interconnected system with non-reheat thermal power units combined with RES such as solar and wind energy is modeled using MATLAB/Simulink to evaluate the system response. The controller effectiveness is verified by subjecting the studied system to various types of fluctuations such as step load disturbance, variable load perturbation and RES penetration. The obtained simulation results prove that the proposed (1+PD)-PID controller in integration with AVOA offers a significant improvement in the system performance specifications. Moreover, the proposed AVOA-based (1+PD)-PID controller has proven its superiority over other comparable controllers having the least fitness function of 6.01 × 10−5.},

Therefore, heat transfer analysis tools with higher accuracy and efficiency are required to verify the effectiveness of cooling designs and continuously improve the design. In this work, a data-driven method is combined with a decoupled conjugate heat transfer analysis. The analysis object is a typical air-cooled gas turbine first-stage vane with film cooling, impingement cooling, and pin-fin cooling. In addition, a conventional 3-D conjugate heat transfer simulation of the vane was executed for contrast. Results show that this method shortens the time of the heat transfer analysis process significantly and ensures accuracy. It proves that the data-driven method is effective for the evaluation of a modern gas turbine cooling design and is an improvement compared to the traditional three-dimensional heat transfer analysis method.},

ABSTRACT = {Heavy oil and natural bitumen resources in carbonate formations are huge and considered as the promising alternative energy resource to the conventional crude oils. However, the production of such resources is challenging due to the low permeability, high viscosity and significant content of resins and asphaltenes in the composition of heavy oil and natural bitumen. The combination of thermal, chemical and gas enhanced oil recoveries can be a promising method to unlock and upgrade heavy oil and natural bitumen in carbonate reservoirs. In this paper, we propose a novel in-situ liquid-phase oxidation of light hydrocarbons for a revolutionary thermo-gas-chemical enhanced oil recovery method, which can be applied in carbonate heavy oil reservoir formations. It is assumed that the oxidation process is carried out in a downhole well reactor, the products of which are a high temperature mixture of organic carboxylic acids and organic solvents. Here, we present the results of laboratory investigations of liquid-phase oxidation of n-hexane as a model compound imitating associated petroleum gases in the presence of Fe, Cr and Ni catalysts, which were introduced in the form of oil-soluble catalyst precursors. It was revealed that the oxidation process yields hydro peroxides, organic carboxylic acids (acetic, propionic and valeric acids), alcohols and ethers. The products of the oxidation process were justified by the results of FT-IR and GC-MS analysis methods. According to the results, Cr-based catalyst leads to the increase of CH3-groups in the products. The oxidation process in the presence of nickel-based catalyst is compared with a control sample. The naphthalene was detected in the oxidation products of all experiments, the formation of which is explained by polymerization of benzene rings. In its turn, benzene is obtained due to dehydrocyclization of n-hexane on the surface of nanoparticles. However, iron-based catalyst showed the best catalytic performance in low-temperature oxidation of n-hexane in autocatalysis mode as the yield of acetic acid prevailed 52%. The given approach provides prolonged thermal and acid treatment of carbonate formations, where the evolved CO2 gas will further assist in increasing the mobility of crude oil. Moreover, the produced alcohols, ethers and other hydrocarbons play the role of solvents, which dissolves polar and non-polar components of crude oil.},

ABSTRACT = {Heavy oil and biomass co-gasification has been analyzed through a model developed in Aspen Plus™ v 11.0 software. The model was used to assess main gasification parameters, such as cold gas efficiency, yield, low heating value (LHV), and producer gas composition, using air and oxygen as gasification agents. Subsequently, producer gas energy use in the Rankine cycle was performed using a model developed in GateCycle™ v11.1.2.4.850 software. Likewise, the economic indicators of the integrated Rankine cycle-gasification system were calculated. The economic evaluation was developed through Monte Carlo simulation using Crystalball™. The results showed a LHV producer gas decreasing trend as the equivalence ratio (ER) increased, oscillating between 6.37 and 3.63 MJ/Nm3 for ER values greater than 0.30 in the air co-gasification case, while the scenario that used oxygen presented better LHV results, ranging from 9.40 to 11.79 MJ/Nm3. For air co-gasification, the Rankine cycle efficiency range was between 13.0% and 9.5%, while for oxygen co-gasification, values between 14.0% and 13.2% were obtained. Regarding the economic assessment, the two scenarios evaluated (with a reliability of 95%) have a probability higher than 92.1% of economic losses due mainly to the lower electrical power and the local electricity rate.},

ABSTRACT = {The vertical heterogeneity of continental shale reservoirs is strong, the difference between lithology and stress between layers is large, the weak interface between layers develops, and the hydraulic fracture penetration and expansion are difficult, resulting in poor fracturing transformation effect. In view of this, based on the finite element and cohesive element method, this paper established a fluid-solid coupling model for the hydraulic fracture propagation through the continental shale and studied the control mechanism and influence law of various geological and engineering parameters on the hydraulic fracture propagation through the continental shale reservoir using single factor and orthogonal test analysis methods. Interfacial cementation strength between high layers, high vertical stress difference, low interlaminar stress difference, low tensile strength difference, low elastic modulus difference, high pressure fracturing fluid viscosity, and high injection displacement are conducive to the penetration and expansion of hydraulic fractures. The primary and secondary order of influence degree of each factor is: interlaminar interface cementation strength > interlaminar stress difference/tensile strength difference > fracturing fluid viscosity/injection displacement > vertical stress difference > elastic modulus. In addition, engineering application research has also been carried out, and it is recommended that the injection displacement during early construction should not be less than 3 m3/min, and the fracturing viscosity should not be less than 45 mPa·s. The field application effect is good, which verifies the engineering application value of the model.},

ABSTRACT = {In a typical ultra-deep high-temperature and high-pressure heterogeneous reservoir in Xinjiang, gas channeling quickly occurs during gas injection because of the heterogeneity of the reservoir, the low viscosity of gas injection, and the high gas-oil fluidity ratio. The identification and prediction methods of gas channeling in gas injection development were studied. First, gas channeling discrimination parameters were determined by the numerical simulation method. According to the ratio of gas to oil produced and the composition of oil and gas produced, the flow stages of formation fluid were divided into five regions: gas phase zone, two-phase zone, miscible zone, dissolved gas and oil zone, and original oil zone. The basis for gas channeling identification (namely, the field characterization parameters for gas channeling discrimination) was discovered through analysis and the knowledge of the operability of field monitoring data as the following two parameters: (1) the C1 content rising again on the previous platform when the trailing edge of the two-phase zone is produced and (2) the continuous rise of the gas-oil ratio in production. Then, considering the original high-pressure characteristics of the reservoir, the field characterization parameters of gas channeling under different formation pressures in the exploitation process (namely, C1 content and gas-oil ratio) were simulated and determined. Thus, a gas channeling discrimination method was established for gas injection development in ultra-deep high-temperature and high-pressure heterogeneous reservoirs. According to this gas injection approach, a gas channeling discrimination method was developed, and the field gas channeling judgment was carried out for a gas injection effective D1 well. The results of gas tracer detection were compared to verify the accuracy of this method, leading to strong support for this method in slowing down the gas channeling.},

ABSTRACT = {The increase in mining depth causes the temperature of the coal seam to rise. Studying the effect of temperature on the mechanical property of coal is very necessary. In this paper, based on the results of conventional triaxial compression experiments of coal samples, the discrete element program PFC2D was used to conduct a conventional triaxial compression simulation of coal samples to obtain microscopic parameters. On this basis, the conventional triaxial simulation study of coal samples at different temperatures was carried out to explore the influence of temperature on the physical and mechanical properties of coal. In this process, acoustic emission and energy monitoring were carried out. The damage and failure process of coal is divided into three stages: the undamaged stage, the stable damage stage, and the rapid damage stage. The relationship between acoustic emission characteristic law, energy transformation law, and crack evolution in the damage and failure process of coal was analyzed in detail. The results indicate that the fracture evolution is affected by the increase in cross-sectional area and the decrease in distance between particles due to the expansion of particles, which corresponds to the phenomenon that the temperature increase produces new microcracks and the particles expand to fill the original cracks in the experiment. This indicates that PFC2D can be used as an effective numerical method for a coal mesoscopic study, and the results of these numerical experiments are also helpful to deepen the understanding of the damage mechanism of coal failure under thermo-mechanical coupling.},

ABSTRACT = {This work focuses on the energy and economic evaluation of a power generation system composed of a downdraft gasifier and gas microturbine. The gasification process was studied using wood pellets as fuel, while the influence of two gasification agents (air and oxygen-enriched air) on parameters, such as low heating value (LHV), composition, and yield of syngas, were analyzed. The syngas produced from oxygen-enriched air gasification in a downdraft gasifier had an LHV higher than 8 MJ/Nm3, being suitable to be supplied in the gas microturbine. Subsequently, syngas use in the gas microturbine was evaluated, and the results demonstrated that microturbine efficiency dropped from 33.00% to 21.35%, while its power decreased from 200 kW to 81.35 kW. The power generation system was modeled using Aspen Plus® v 11.0 software and validated using results obtained from published experimental studies. Accordingly, the integrated generation system presented an overall efficiency of 11.82% for oxygen-enriched air gasification cases. On the other hand, an economic assessment through risk analysis using Monte Carlo simulations was performed using Crystal Ball® v11.1.2.4.850 software. The economic results indicated that the implementation of a generation system was economically unfeasible, however, if the electricity rate price was increased by 63%, the proposed configuration could be feasible.},

ABSTRACT = {Here, we reported on experimental studies related to the exposure of oil to a 50 Hz electromagnetic field (0.81 T strength) and examined the changes in the geochemical characteristics of oil: n-alkane distribution, isotopic composition (δ13C), and concentration of paramagnetic centers. We discovered that electromagnetic fields have impacts on the distribution of n-alkanes and on their individual isotopic composition, with the concentration of paramagnetic centers remaining unchanged. While discussing the results, we looked into the state-of-the-art of research on electromagnetic exposures of the bottom-hole formation zone and into natural electric and geomagnetic fields. We consequently hypothesized that natural geomagnetic fields can influence the geochemical evolution processes of oil. This hypothesis requires further studies to reveal the frequency and strength characteristics of natural geomagnetic fields.},

ABSTRACT = {Determining residual oil saturation by the single-well chemical tracer test (SWCTT) is of key importance for assessing the potential of enhanced oil recovery (EOR) and developing EOR pilot projects. However, the test trials conducted since the first injections of tracer compositions until now have not resulted in a detailed analysis of the selection of candidates for single-well tracers and their limits of applicability in various reservoir conditions. The purpose of this study was to consider the influence of the structure on the kinetic and thermodynamic components of tracers to assess their application’s operating intervals. It is shown that the rate of single-phase and two-phase hydrolysis of the primary partitioning tracer makes it possible to predict the shut-in time by calculating when the tracer is injected at the reservoir temperature. The influence of the tracer structure during the extraction process with an increase in the hydrocarbon chain of the ester in a different range of brine salinity and temperature has been studied. As a result, this work provides a method for evaluating the thermodynamic and kinetic behavior of primary tracers to establish minimum and maximum threshold K-values at various values of residual oil saturation, temperature, and brine salinity, taking into account the optimal time of the well shut-in to carry out at least 1/2 hydrolysis of esters.},

ABSTRACT = {Cold storage facilities consume a considerable amount of energy, especially in hot climates, which can be decreased using thermal insulators to maintain a stable temperature. The primary aim of this research study was to determine the effect of insulation thickness on the energy efficiency and cost savings of exterior walls for cold storage facilities in all climatic zones of Türkiye. To this end, data from the meteorological databases of 81 provinces were analyzed, and four insulation materials (expanded polystyrene, extruded polystyrene, rock wool, and polyurethane) were selected for different cold storage reference temperatures. The spatial distributions of optimal insulation thickness, energy savings, and payback periods were derived using a geographic information system (Ordinary Kriging). The optimum insulation thickness and energy savings were found to be 0.020–0.137 m and 0.030–6.883 USD/m2, respectively. Depending on the insulation material and base temperature, the shortest payback periods (1.498–3.457 years) were obtained in the Aegean and Mediterranean regions. In addition, rock wool provided the highest energy savings and the shortest payback period among all the insulation materials studied. The results from this study can help investors to improve their design considerations for cold storage wall insulation.},

ABSTRACT = {Improving the dielectric properties of liquid-insulating materials is a current problem in research into the insulation system of a power transformer. Modern optimization of insulating liquids involves the potential use of unique synthetic esters enriched with nanoparticles. This study presents the results of the dielectric response of liquefied gas-based (GTL) insulating liquids during accelerated thermal aging. The dielectric relaxation spectroscopy method was used in the frequency domain to point out power losses as an imaginary part of a complex electric modulus. The relaxation spectra express the validity of applying this complex dielectric parameter. The polarization processes of the base oil alternately change position in the low-frequency band during thermal aging. Fullerene nanofluid undergoes three phases of dielectric loss changes during thermal aging. In the case of magnetic nanofluid, the effect of electric double-layer polarization disappeared after 500 h of thermal aging. It was found that with the gradual increase in the thermal aging time, there is no gradual increase in the dielectric losses investigated in the measured frequency spectrum. This study shows that the concentration of the two types of nanoparticles independently causes a different dielectric response to an applied AC electric field in the GTL base fluid.},

ABSTRACT = {Rainfall infiltration is one of the main triggers of inner dump slope failure in the process of mining coal. Changes in water content throughout the process of rainfall infiltration have rarely been studied. The reductions in soil strength due to water migration have seldomly been considered in the existing analytical solution of the safety factor (F.S) for unsaturated inner dump slopes in an open-pit mine. In this work, a new mechanical model was developed by improving the conventional analytical solutions of F.S for unsaturated inner dump slopes to accommodate water-induced degradation in the mechanical strength of waste material. Parameter analysis was carried out via a case study of the Shengli #1 open-pit coalmine. The results showed that the wetting front depth increased with increasing rainfall time, and the increasing rate was constant during the non-compressive infiltration stage, while it decreased gradually in the compressive infiltration stage. The F.S of the transition layer decreased at first and then increased with increasing infiltration depth. By considering the water migration in the inner dump slope, the calculation result of F.S by the analytical solution in the paper can more precisely represent the in situ conditions. It was larger than that of the saturated strength, but smaller than that of the natural strength. The position of the minimum F.S did not alter in the wetting front, but was close to the position of the wetting front. The depth of the potential slip surface can be calculated by the converse solution of the analytical equation when F.S = 1 for rainfall infiltration, and the most dangerous slope surface can be determined. The depth (hmin) of the potential slip surface increases with increasing wetting front (hf) by a linear function, and increases with increasing depth ratios of the saturation layer (λ). The depth ratio (i) of the minimum F.S increases with increasing λ by an exponential function. The improved analytical solution can be used to evaluate the potential sliding surface under rainfall conditions, which is helpful for evaluating slope stability and analyzing dangerous surfaces under rainfall conditions and providing guidance for reinforcement schemes.},

ABSTRACT = {The negative environmental impact of the construction sector has garnered global attention, and as the “primary force” in achieving the “double carbon” target, green development is urgent, and social responsibility practices cannot be postponed. An evolutionary game model was constructed by combining the rank-dependent expected utility (RDEU) theory and the evolutionary game theory to understand the interaction mechanism between participants’ emotions and decisions, taking into account the characteristics of construction enterprises and the public regarding irrational decisions under heterogeneous emotional combinations. The study demonstrates that: (1) there is probability in the choice of rational strategies, and emotion is an irrational factor that can affect strategy choice. (2) The evolutionary trend of the strategy choice of the game subjects is altered by emotional intensity and emotional propensity. The optimism of construction enterprises inhibits their socially responsible practice, and the pessimism of the public promotes the probability of their negative strategy choice. Furthermore, moderate optimism is a safety valve for the public’s positive strategy choice. (3) The interaction of emotional states leads to a heterogeneity of strategy choices exhibited under different combinations of emotions, with the emotions of construction companies having a more dominant influence on strategy. Finally, we make some feasible recommendations for improving social responsibility practices and preventing mass incidents by boosting emotional monitoring and guidance for construction businesses and the general public. Overall, this study provides important information about how to be socially responsible, maintain good relationships with the public, and protect the environment.},

ABSTRACT = {Proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWEs) coupled with renewable energy resources are considered to be a key technology for producing green hydrogen. However, the high current density PEMWE operation features remarkable voltage losses. A significant part of these losses is due to the mass transport resistance in the PEMWE. Even though the importance of mass transport resistance is widely recognized, it is still poorly understood. Currently, the two-phase transport through the anode porous transport layer (PTL) and catalyst layer is considered to be the main cause of the mass transport losses. In this work, a dynamic macroscopic mathematical model, coupling electrochemical reaction with mass transport through the PTL and flow channels, has been developed to study the two-phase flow in the PTL and mass transport losses of a PEMWE. The influence of the current density, inlet water flow rate, PTL structural parameters, and capillary pressure curve was evaluated. The existence of the critical current density was observed, as well as its dependence on the operating parameters and PTL structure. Even though the results show that the PTL structure has a significant influence on the PEMWE performance, they indicate that a better mathematical description of the two-phase flow in the PTL is necessary.},

ABSTRACT = {The high cost of Lithium-ion battery systems is one of the biggest challenges hindering the wide adoption of electric vessels. For some marine applications, battery systems based on the current monotype topologies are significantly oversized due to variable operational profiles and long lifespan requirements. This paper deals with the battery hybrid energy storage system (HESS) for an electric harbor tug to optimize the size of the battery system. The impact of battery hybridization was investigated on three key performance indicators inclusive of cost, system efficiency, and battery weight. The design life of the battery system is considered to be 10 years, and NMC and LTO cell technologies are used as high-energy (HE) and high-power (HP) battery cells. The HESS design is based on a parallel full-active architecture with a rule-based energy management strategy. The results of this research indicate that battery hybridization can reduce the system cost by around 28% and 14% in comparison with a monotype battery with LTO and NMC cells, respectively. Although no noticeable difference in system efficiency is observed between the monotype system and HESS, battery hybridization reduces the total weight of the battery cells by more than 30% compared to monotype topology. This study implies that the hybridization of battery systems could be a promising solution to reduce the cost and weight of large battery packs in electric vessels.},

ABSTRACT = {Many types of volcanic rock oil and gas reservoirs have been found in China, showing great petroleum exploration potential. Volcanic reservoir also is one of the key fields of exploration in the Junggar Basin and mainly concentrated in the middle and shallow layers, while the deep volcanic rock and natural gas fields have not been broken through. Based on comprehensive analysis of core observation, single well analysis, reservoir description, source rocks evaluation, combined with seismic data and time-frequency electromagnetic technology, multiple volcanic rock exploration targets were identified, and industrial oil and gas flow was obtained in the well SX 16 of the Penyijingxi Sag, western Junggar Basin. It is believed that the deep Permian source rocks have relatively higher natural gas generation potential and volcanic breccia usually have large reservoir space. And the mudstone of the Upper Wuerhe Formation played as the role of caprock. The success of exploration well SX16 has achieved a major breakthrough in natural gas exploration in the Penyijingxi Sag, which has essential guiding significance for the exploration of deep volcanic rocks and large-scale gas exploration in the Junggar Basin.},

ABSTRACT = {The rising use of renewable energy sources, particularly those that are weather-dependent like wind and solar energy, has increased the uncertainty of supply in these power systems. In order to obtain considerably more accurate results in the analysis of power systems, such as in the planning and operation, it is necessary to tackle the stochastic nature of these sources. Operators require adequate techniques and procedures to mitigate the negative consequences of the stochastic behavior of renewable energy generators. Thus, this paper presents a modification of the original probability distribution functions (PDFs) where the original PDFs are insufficient for wind speed and solar irradiance modeling because they have a significant error between the real data frequency distribution and the estimated distribution curve. This modification is using a mixture of probability distributions, which can improve the fitting of data and reduce this error. The main aim of this paper is to model wind speed and solar irradiance behaviors using a two-component and a three-component mixture of PDFs generated from the integration of the original Weibull, Lognormal, Gamma, and Inverse-Gaussian PDFs. Three statistical errors are used to test the efficiency of the proposed original and mixture PDFs, which are the root mean square error (RMSE), the coefficient of correlation (R2), and the Chi-square error (X2). The results show that the mixture of PDFs gives better fitting criteria for wind speed and solar irradiance frequency distributions than the original PDFs. The parameters of the original and the mixture of PDFs are calculated using the innovative metaheuristic Mayfly algorithm (MA). The three-component mixture of PDFs lowered the RMSE by about 73% and was 17% more than the best original and the two-component mixture distributions.},

ABSTRACT = {In the propulsion system of cryogenic liquid rockets, low-frequency pressure oscillation is a long-standing issue occurring in its feeding pipe, and is not conducive to the normal operation of the rocket. Its mechanism and excitation process are not very clear due to the limitation of the existing numerical method and the difficulty of the real dynamic experiment. Inspired by the periodic suck-back flow phenomenon of steam condensation, the fluctuation of the two-phase interface might be the crucial factor to initiate the low-frequency pressure oscillation. To simulate this interfacial characteristic of cryogenic propellant, a novel numerical model is proposed to predict the mass transfer rate weighted by the interfacial curvature. Aiming at the oxygen jet condensation simulation, the low-frequency pressure oscillation phenomenon is obtained successfully with the excitation frequency of 10.6 Hz, consistent with the natural frequency of the engine test run. It is conducted so the low-frequency pressure oscillation is caused by the periodic condensation of the continuous oxygen vapour plume, along with an oxygen suck-back flow phenomenon. In addition, the results indicate that both the oxygen and liquid oxygen mass flux promote the rise in the frequency of pressure oscillation. These conclusions provide theoretical instructions for the design and operation of the propulsion system of a cryogenic liquid rocket.},

ABSTRACT = {The low permeability and thinly interbedded reservoirs have poor physical properties and strong interbedded heterogeneity, and it is difficult to control the hydraulic fracture (HF) height and width during hydraulic fracturing, which affects the effect of HF penetration and sand addition. In this work, a three-dimensional fluid–solid fully coupled HF propagation model is established to simulate the influence of interlayer heterogeneity on vertical HF height and HF width, and the relationship between HF length and HF width under different treatment parameters is further studied. The results show that, in thin interbedded strata, the high interlayer stress contrast, high tensile strength, and low Young’s modulus will inhibit the vertical propagation of HFs. The interlayer heterogeneity results in the vertical wavy distribution of HF width. Under the high interlayer stress contrast, Young’s modulus, and tensile strength, the HF width profile becomes narrow and the variation amplitude decreases. The HF length decreases and the HF width increases as the injection rate and fracturing fluid viscosity increase. This study is of great significance for clarifying the vertical propagation pattern in thinly interbedded reservoirs, optimizing the treatment parameters, and improving the effect of cross fracturing and proppant distribution.},
