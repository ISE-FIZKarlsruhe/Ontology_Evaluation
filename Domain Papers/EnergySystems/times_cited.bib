ABSTRACT = {Shale gas production is associated with significant usage of fresh water and discharge of wastewater. Consequently, there is a necessity to create proper management strategies for water resources in shale gas production and to integrate conventional energy sources (e.g., shale gas) with renewables (e.g., solar energy). The objective of this study is to develop a design framework for integrating water and energy systems including multiple energy sources, the cogeneration process and desalination technologies in treating wastewater and providing fresh water for shale gas production. Solar energy is included to provide thermal power directly to a multi-effect distillation plant (MED) exclusively (to be more feasible economically) or indirect supply through a thermal energy storage system. Thus, MED is driven by direct or indirect solar energy and excess or direct cogeneration process heat. The proposed thermal energy storage along with the fossil fuel boiler will allow for the dual-purpose system to operate at steady-state by managing the dynamic variability of solar energy. Additionally, electric production is considered to supply a reverse osmosis plant (RO) without connecting to the local electric grid. A multi-period mixed integer nonlinear program (MINLP) is developed and applied to discretize the operation period to track the diurnal fluctuations of solar energy. The solution of the optimization program determines the optimal mix of solar energy, thermal storage and fossil fuel to attain the maximum annual profit of the entire system. A case study is solved for water treatment and energy management for Eagle Ford Basin in Texas.},

ABSTRACT = {To reduce CO 2 emissions from power plants, electricity companies have diversified their generation sources. Fossil fuels, however, still remain an integral energy generation source as they are more reliable compared to the renewable energy sources. This diversification as well as changing electricity demand could hinder effective economical operation of an amine-based post-combustion CO 2 capture (PCC) plant attached to the power plant to reduce CO 2 emissions. This is as a result of large fluctuations in the flue gas flow rate and unavailability of steam from the power plant. To tackle this problem, efficient control algorithms are necessary. In this work, tracking and economic model predictive controllers are applied to a PCC plant and their economic performance is compared under different scenarios. The results show that economic model predictive control has a potential to improve the economic performance and energy efficiency of the amine-based PCC process up to 6% and 7%, respectively, over conventional model predictive control.},

ABSTRACT = {The recent shale gas boom has transformed the energy landscape of the United States. Compared to natural gas, shale resources contain a substantial amount of condensate and natural gas liquids (NGLs). Many shale basin regions located in remote areas are lacking the infrastructure to distribute the extracted NGLs to other regions—particularly the Gulf Coast, a major gas processing region. Here we present a shale gas transformation process that converts NGLs in shale resources into liquid hydrocarbons, which are easier to transport from these remote basins than NGL or its constituents. This process involves catalytic dehydrogenation followed by catalytic oligomerization. Thermodynamic process analysis shows that this process has the potential to be more energy efficient than existing NGL-to-liquid fuel (NTL) technologies. In addition, our estimated payback period for this process is within the average lifetime of shale gas wells. The proposed process holds the promise to be an energy efficient and economically attractive step to valorize condensate in remote shale basins.},

ABSTRACT = {Supercritical carbon dioxide (S-CO2) Brayton cycles (BC) are soon to be a competitive and environment friendly power generation technology. Progressive technological developments in turbo-machineries and heat exchangers have boosted the idea of using S-CO2 in a closed-loop BC. This paper describes and discusses energy and exergy analysis of S-CO2 BC in cascade arrangement with a secondary cycle using CO2, R134a, ammonia, or argon as working fluids. Pressure drop in the cycle is considered, and its effect on the overall performance is investigated. No specific heat source is considered, thus any heat source capable of providing temperature in the range from 500 °C to 850 °C can be utilized, such as solar energy, gas turbine exhaust, nuclear waste heat, etc. The commercial software ‘Aspen HYSYS version 9’ (Aspen Technology, Inc., Bedford, MA, USA) is used for simulations. Comparisons with the literature and simulation results are discussed first for the standalone S-CO2 BC. Energy analysis is done for the combined cycle to inspect the parameters affecting the cycle performance. The second law efficiency is calculated, and exergy losses incurred in different components of the cycle are discussed.},

ABSTRACT = {The market for the small-scale micro gas turbine is expected to grow rapidly in the coming years. Especially, utilization of commercial off-the-shelf components is rapidly reducing the cost of ownership and maintenance, which is paving the way for vast adoption of such units. However, to meet the high-reliability requirements of power generators, there is an acute need of a real-time monitoring system that will be able to detect faults and performance degradation, and thus allow preventive maintenance of these units to decrease downtime. In this paper, a micro gas turbine based combined heat and power system is modelled and used for development of physics-based diagnostic approaches. Different diagnostic schemes for performance monitoring of micro gas turbines are investigated.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper we propose a methodology to study circular economy processes based on mathematical modelling. In open-ended systems, waste could be converted back to recycling, transforming the economy from linear to circular. The concept of entropy and the second law of thermodynamics give the argument for a scale reduction of material circulation. As humans extract more and more energy and matter for the economy, the degree of entropy is likely to increase. Based on the findings of economic studies on the implications of industrialization in the case of growing economies, this study aims at evaluating circular economy processes at the European Union (EU) level using a Shannon-Entropy-based algorithm. An entropy-based analysis was conducted for the 28 European Union countries during the time frame 2007–2016. The modelling process consists of constructing a composite indicator which is composed of a weighted sum of all indicators developed by an algorithm based on Shannon Entropy. The weights assigned to each indicator in our analysis measure the significance of each indicator involved in the development of the composite indicator. The results are similar to the international rakings, consolidating and confirming the accuracy and reliability of this approach.},

ABSTRACT = {Traditional energy production plants are increasingly forced to cycle their load and operate under low-load conditions in response to growth in intermittent renewable generation. A plant-wide dynamic model of a supercritical pulverized coal (SCPC) power plant has been developed in the Aspen Plus Dynamics® (APD) software environment and the impact of advanced control strategies on the transient responses of the key variables to load-following operation and disturbances can be studied. Models of various key unit operations, such as the steam turbine, are developed in Aspen Custom Modeler® (ACM) and integrated in the APD environment. A coordinated control system (CCS) is developed above the regulatory control layer. Three control configurations are evaluated for the control of the main steam; the reheat steam temperature is also controlled. For studying servo control performance of the CCS, the load is decreased from 100% to 40% at a ramp rate of 3% load per min. The impact of a disturbance due to a change in the coal feed composition is also studied. The CCS is found to yield satisfactory performance for both servo control and disturbance rejection.},

ABSTRACT = {The attempt to reduce the environmental impact of the petroleum sector has been the driver for researching energy efficient solutions to supply energy offshore. An attractive option is to develop innovative energy systems including renewable and conventional sources. The paper investigates the possibility to integrate a wind farm into an offshore combined cycle power plant. The design of such an energy system is a complex task as many, possibly conflicting, requirements have to be satisfied. The large variability of operating conditions due to the intermittent nature of wind and to the different stages of exploitation of an oil field makes it challenging to identify the optimal parameters of the combined cycle and the optimal size of the wind farm. To deal with the issue, an optimisation procedure was developed that was able to consider the performance of the system at a number of relevant off-design conditions in the definition of the optimal design. A surrogate modelling technique was applied in order to reduce the computational effort that would otherwise make the optimisation process unfeasible. The developed method was applied to a case study and the resulting optimal designs were assessed and compared to other concepts, with or without wind power integration. The proposed offshore power plant returned the best environmental performance, as it was able to significantly cut the total carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in comparison to all the other concepts evaluated. The economic analysis showed the difficulty to repay the additional investment for a wind farm and the necessity of favourable conditions, in terms of gas and carbon dioxide (CO2) prices.},

ABSTRACT = {The penetration of renewable power generation is increasing at an unprecedented pace. While the operating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of photovoltaic (PV) and wind power are negligible, their upstream emissions are not. The great challenge with the deployment of renewable power generators is their intermittent and variable nature. Current electric power systems balance these fluctuations primarily using natural gas fired power plants. Alternatively, these dynamics could be handled by the integration of energy storage technologies to store energy during renewable energy availability and discharge when needed. In this paper, we present a model for estimating emissions from integrated power generation and energy storage. The model applies to emissions of all pollutants, including greenhouse gases (GHGs), and to all storage technologies, including pumped hydroelectric and electrochemical storage. As a case study, the model is used to estimate the GHG emissions of electricity from systems that couple photovoltaic and wind generation with lithium-ion batteries (LBs) and vanadium redox flow batteries (VFBs). To facilitate the case study, we conducted a life cycle assessment (LCA) of photovoltaic (PV) power, as well as a synthesis of existing wind power LCAs. The PV LCA is also used to estimate the emissions impact of a common PV practice that has not been comprehensively analyzed by LCA—solar tracking. The case study of renewables and battery storage indicates that PV and wind power remain much less carbon intensive than fossil-based generation, even when coupled with large amounts of LBs or VFBs. Even the most carbon intensive renewable power analyzed still emits only ~25% of the GHGs of the least carbon intensive mainstream fossil power. Lastly, we find that the pathway to minimize the GHG emissions of power from a coupled system depends upon the generator. Given low-emission generation (<50 gCO2e/kWh), the minimizing pathway is the storage technology with lowest production emissions (VFBs over LBs for our case study). Given high-emission generation (>200 gCO2e/kWh), the minimizing pathway is the storage technology with highest round-trip efficiency (LBs over VFBs).},

ABSTRACT = {Trailing oil is the tail section of contamination in oil pipelines. It is generated in batch transportation, for which one fluid, such as diesel oil follows another fluid, such as gasoline, and it has an effect on the quality of oil. This paper describes our analysis of the formation mechanism of trailing oil in pipelines and our study of the influence of dead-legs on the formation of trailing oil. We found that the oil replacement rate in a dead-leg is exponentially related to the flow speed, and the length of the dead-leg is exponentially related to the replacement time of the oil. To reduce the amount of mixed oil, the main flow speed should be kept at about 1.6 m/s, and the length of the dead-leg should be less than five times the diameter of the main pipe. In our work, the Reynolds time-averaged method is used to simulate turbulence. To obtain contamination-related experimental data, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software is used to simulate different flow rates and bypass lengths. MATLAB software was used to perform multi-nonlinear regression for the oil substitution time, the length of the bypass, and the flow speed. We determined an equation for calculating the length of the trailing oil contamination produced by the dead-leg. A modified equation for calculating the length of the contamination was obtained by combining the existing equation for calculating the length of the contamination with new factors based on our work. The amounts of contamination predicted by the new equation is closer to the actual contamination amounts than predicted values from other methods suggested by previous scholars.},

ABSTRACT = {The available energy can be effectively upgraded by adopting smart energy conversion measures. The biodegradability of biomass can be improved by employing pretreatment techniques; however, such methods result in reduced energy efficiency. In this study, microwave (MW) irradiation is used for green algae (Enteromorpha) pretreatment in combination with iron oxide nanoparticles (NPs) which act as a heterogeneous catalyst during anaerobic digestion process for biogas enhancement. Batch-wise anaerobic digestion was carried out. The results showed that MW pretreatment and its combination with Fe3O4 NPs produced highest yields of biogas and hydrogen as compared to the individual ones and control. The biogas amount and hydrogen % v/v achieved by MW pretreatment + Fe3O4 NPs group were 328 mL and 51.5%, respectively. The energy analysis indicated that synergistic application of MW pretreatment with Fe3O4 NPs produced added energy while consuming less input energy than MW pretreatment alone. The kinetic parameters of the reaction were scientifically evaluated by using modified Gompertz and Logistic function model for each experimental case. MW pretreatment + Fe3O4 NPs group improved biogas production potential and maximum biogas production rate.},

ABSTRACT = {The electrification of the petrochemical industry, imposed by the urgent need for decarbonization and driven by the incessant growth of renewable electricity share, necessitates electricity-driven technologies for efficient conversion of fossil fuels to chemicals. Non-thermal plasma reactor systems that successfully perform in lab scale are investigated for this purpose. However, the feasibility of such electrified processes at industrial scale is still questionable. In this context, two process alternatives for ethylene production via plasma-assisted non-oxidative methane coupling have conceptually been designed based on previous work of our group namely, a direct plasma-assisted methane-to-ethylene process (one-step process) and a hybrid plasma-catalytic methane-to-ethylene process (two-step process). Both processes are simulated in the Aspen Plus V10 process simulator and also consider the technical limitations of a real industrial environment. The economically favorable operating window (range of operating conditions at which the target product purity is met at minimum utility cost) is defined via sensitivity analysis. Preliminary results reveal that the hybrid plasma-catalytic process requires 21% less electricity than the direct one, while the electric power consumed for the plasma-assisted reaction is the major cost driver in both processes, accounting for ~75% of the total electric power demand. Finally, plasma-assisted processes are not economically viable at present. However, future decrease in electricity prices due to renewable electricity production increase can radically affect process economics. Given that a break-even electricity price of 35 USD/MWh (without considering the capital cost) is calculated for the two-step plasma process and that current electricity prices for some energy intensive industries in certain countries can be as low as 50 USD/MWh, the plasma-assisted processes may become economically viable in the future.},

ABSTRACT = {Influenced by the complexity of ocean environmental noise and the time-varying of underwater acoustic channels, feature extraction of underwater acoustic signals has always been a difficult challenge. To solve this dilemma, this paper introduces a hybrid energy feature extraction approach for ship-radiated noise (S-RN) based on complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) combined with energy difference (ED) and energy entropy (EE). This approach, named CEEMDAN-ED-EE, has two main advantages: (i) compared with empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and ensemble EMD (EEMD), CEEMDAN has better decomposition performance by overcoming mode mixing, and the intrinsic mode function (IMF) obtained by CEEMDAN is beneficial to feature extraction; (ii) the classification performance of the single energy feature has some limitations, nevertheless, the proposed hybrid energy feature extraction approach has a better classification performance. In this paper, we first decompose three types of S-RN into sub-signals, named intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). Then, we obtain the features of energy difference and energy entropy based on IMFs, named CEEMDAN-ED and CEEMDAN-EE, respectively. Finally, we compare the recognition rate for three sorts of S-RN by using the following three energy feature extraction approaches, which are CEEMDAN-ED, CEEMDAN-EE and CEEMDAN-ED-EE. The experimental results prove the effectivity and the high recognition rate of the proposed approach.},

ABSTRACT = {With the rapid increase in production of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and environmental issues arising around the world, cathode materials, as the key component of all LIBs, especially need to be environmentally sustainable. However, a variety of life cycle assessment (LCA) methods increase the difficulty of environmental sustainability assessment. Three authoritative LCAs, IMPACT 2002+, Eco-indicator 99(EI-99), and ReCiPe, are used to assess three traditional marketization cathode materials, compared with a new cathode model, FeF3(H2O)3/C. They all show that four cathode models are ranked by a descending sequence of environmental sustainable potential: FeF3(H2O)3/C, LiFe0.98Mn0.02PO4/C, LiFePO4/C, and LiCoO2/C in total values. Human health is a common issue regarding these four cathode materials. Lithium is the main contributor to the environmental impact of the latter three cathode materials. At the midpoint level in different LCAs, the toxicity and land issues for LiCoO2/C, the non-renewable resource consumption for LiFePO4/C, the metal resource consumption for LiFe0.98Mn0.02PO4/C, and the mineral refinement for FeF3(H2O)3/C show relatively low environmental sustainability. Three LCAs have little influence on total endpoint and element contribution values. However, at the midpoint level, the indicator with the lowest environmental sustainability for the same cathode materials is different in different methodologies.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper proposes a microelectric power grid that includes wind and fuel cell power generation units, as well as a water electrolyzer for producing hydrogen gas. The grid is loaded by an induction motor (IM) as a dynamic load and constant impedance load. An optimal control algorithm using the Mine Blast Algorithm (MBA) is designed to improve the performance of the proposed renewable energy system. Normally, wind power is adapted to feed the loads at normal circumstances. Nevertheless, the fuel cell compensates extra load power demand. An optimal controller is applied to regulate the load voltage and frequency of the main power inverter. Also, optimal vector control is applied to the IM speed control. The response of the microgrid with the proposed optimal control is obtained under step variation in wind speed, load impedance, IM rotor speed, and motor mechanical load torque. The simulation results indicate that the proposed renewable generation system supplies the system loads perfectly and keeps up the desired load demand. Furthermore, the IM speed performance is acceptable under turbulent wind speed.},

ABSTRACT = {Pakistan has long relied on fossil fuels for electricity generation. This is despite the fact that the country is blessed with enormous renewable energy (RE) resources, which can significantly diversify the fuel mix for electricity generation. In this study, various renewable resources of Pakistan—solar, hydro, biomass, wind, and geothermal energy—are analyzed by using an integrated Delphi-analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and fuzzy technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (F-TOPSIS)-based methodology. In the first phase, the Delphi method was employed to define and select the most important criteria for the selection of RE resources. This process identified four main criteria, i.e., economic, environmental, technical, and socio-political aspects, which are further supplemented by 20 sub-criteria. AHP is later used to obtain the weights of each criterion and the sub-criteria of the decision model. The results of this study reveal wind energy as the most feasible RE resource for electricity generation followed by hydropower, solar, biomass, and geothermal energy. The sensitivity analysis of the decision model results shows that the results of this study are significant, reliable, and robust. The study provides important insights related to the prioritizing of RE resources for electricity generation and can be used to undertake policy decisions toward sustainable energy planning in Pakistan.},

ABSTRACT = {The integration of scheduling and process planning can eliminate resource conflicts and hence improve the performance of a manufacturing system. However, the focus of most existing works is mainly on the optimization techniques to improve the makespan criterion instead of more efficient uses of energy. In fact, with a deteriorating global climate caused by massive coal-fired power consumption, carbon emission reduction in the manufacturing sector is becoming increasingly imperative. To ease the environmental burden caused by energy consumption, e.g., coal-fired power consumption in use of machine tools, this research considers both makespan as well as environmental performance criteria, e.g., total power consumption, in integrated process planning and scheduling using a novel multi-objective memetic algorithm to facilitate a potential amount of energy savings; this can be realized through a better use of resources with more efficient scheduling schemes. A mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model based on the network graph is formulated with both makespan as well as total power consumption criteria. Due to the complexity of the problem, a multi-objective memetic algorithm with variable neighborhood search (VNS) technique is then developed for this problem. The Kim’s benchmark instances are employed to test the proposed algorithm. Moreover, the TOPSIS decision method is used to determine the most satisfactory non-dominated solution. Several scenarios are considered to simulate different machine automation levels and different machine workload levels. Computational results show that the proposed algorithm can strike a balance between the makespan criterion and the total power consumption criterion, and the total power consumption can be affected by machine tools with different automation levels and different workloads. More importantly, results also show that energy saving can be realized by completing machining as early as possible on a machine tool and taking advantage of machine flexibility.},

However, with the rapid increase of the population and increasing dependency on the daily use of energy due to smart technologies and the Internet of Things (IoT), the existing resources are becoming scarce. Therefore, to have an optimum usage of the existing energy resources on the consumer side, new techniques and algorithms are being discovered and used in the energy optimization process in the smart grid (SG). In SG, because of the possibility of bi-directional power flow and communication between the utility and consumers, an active and optimized energy scheduling technique is essential, which minimizes the end-user electricity bill, reduces the peak-to-average power ratio (PAR) and reduces the frequency of interruptions. Because of the varying nature of the power consumption patterns of consumers, optimized scheduling of energy consumption is a challenging task. For the maximum benefit of both the utility and consumers, to decide whether to store, buy or sale extra energy, such active environmental features must also be taken into consideration. This paper presents two bio-inspired energy optimization techniques; the grasshopper optimization algorithm (GOA) and bacterial foraging algorithm (BFA), for power scheduling in a single office. It is clear from the simulation results that the consumer electricity bill can be reduced by more than 34.69% and 37.47%, while PAR has a reduction of 56.20% and 20.87% with GOA and BFA scheduling, respectively, as compared to unscheduled energy consumption with the day-ahead pricing (DAP) scheme.},

ABSTRACT = {In order to precisely control the wind power generation systems under nonlinear variable wind velocity, this paper proposes a novel maximum power tracking (MPPT) strategy for wind turbine systems based on a hybrid wind velocity forecasting algorithm. The proposed algorithm adapts the bat algorithm and improved extreme learning machine (BA-ELM) for forecasting wind speed to alleviate the slow response of anemometers and sensors, considering that the change of wind speed requires a very short response time. In the controlling strategy, to optimize the output power, a state feedback control technique is proposed to achieve the rotor flux and rotor speed tracking purpose based on MPPT algorithm. This method could decouple the current and voltage of induction generator to track the reference of stator current and flux linkage. By adjusting the wind turbine mechanical speed, the wind energy system could operate at the optimal rotational speed and achieve the maximal power. Simulation results verified the effectiveness of the proposed technique.},

ABSTRACT = {The continuous increase in the number of stringent exhaust emission legislations of marine Diesel engines had led to a decrease in NOx emissions at the required level. Selective catalyst reduction (SCR) is the most prominent and mature technology used to reduce NOx emissions. However, to obtain maximum NOx removal with minimum ammonia slip remains a challenge. Therefore, new mixers are designed in order to obtain the maximum SCR efficiency. This paper reports performance parameters such as uniformity of velocity, ammonia uniformity distribution, and temperature distribution. Also, a numerical model is developed to investigate the interaction of urea droplet with exhaust gas and its effects by using line (LM) and swirl (SM) type mixers alone and in combination (LSM). The urea droplet residence time and its interaction in straight pipe are also investigated. Model calculations proved the improvement in velocity uniformity, distribution of ammonia uniformity, and temperature distribution for LSM. Prominent enhancement in the evaporation rate was also achieved by using LSM, which may be due to the breaking of urea droplets into droplets of smaller diameter. Therefore, the SCR system accomplished higher urea conversion efficiency by using LSM. Lastly, the ISO 8178 standard engine test cycle E3 was used to verify the simulation results. It has been observed that the average weighted value of NOx emission obtained at SCR outlet using LSM was 2.44 g/kWh, which strongly meets International Maritime Organization (IMO) Tier III NOx (3.4 g/kWh) emission regulations.},

ABSTRACT = {In this study, we developed a new hybrid mathematical model that combines wind-speed range with the log law to derive the wind energy potential for wind-generated hydrogen production in Pakistan. In addition, we electrolyzed wind-generated power in order to assess the generation capacity of wind-generated renewable hydrogen. The advantage of the Weibull model is that it more accurately reflects power generation potential (i.e., the capacity factor). When applied to selected sites, we have found commercially viable hydrogen production capacity in all locations. All sites considered had the potential to produce an excess amount of wind-generated renewable hydrogen. If the total national capacity of wind-generated was used, Pakistan could conceivably produce 51,917,000.39 kg per day of renewable hydrogen. Based on our results, we suggest that cars and other forms of transport could be fueled with hydrogen to conserve oil and gas resources, which can reduce the energy shortfall and contribute to the fight against climate change and global warming. Also, hydrogen could be used to supplement urban energy needs (e.g., for Sindh province Pakistan), again reducing energy shortage effects and supporting green city programs.},

ABSTRACT = {Electricity demand in Pakistan has consistently increased in the past two decades. However, this demand is so far partially met due to insufficient supply, inefficient power plants, high transmission and distribution system losses, lack of effective planning efforts and due coordination. The existing electricity generation also largely depends on the imported fossil fuels, which is a huge burden on the national economy alongside causing colossal loss to the environment. It is also evident from existing government plans that electricity generation from low-cost coal fuels in the near future will further increase the emissions. As such, in this study, following the government’s electricity demand forecast, four supply side scenarios for the study period (2013–2035) have been developed using Long-range Energy Alternatives Planning System (LEAP) software tool. These scenarios are Reference scenario (REF) based on the government’s power expansion plans, and three alternative scenarios, which include, More Renewable (MRR), More Hydro (MRH), and More Hydro Nuclear (MRHN). Furthermore, the associated gaseous emissions (CO2, SO2, NOX, CH4, N2O) are projected under each of these scenarios. The results of this study reveal that the alternative scenarios are more environmentally friendly than the REF scenario where penetration of planned coal-based power generation plants would be the major sources of emissions. It is, therefore, recommended that the government, apart from implementing the existing plans, should consider harnessing the renewable energy sources as indispensable energy sources in the future energy mix for electricity generation to reduce the fossil-fuel import bill and to contain the emissions.},

ABSTRACT = {Double-suction centrifugal pumps are widely used in industrial and agricultural applications since their flow rate is twice that of single-suction pumps with the same impeller diameter. They usually run for longer, which makes them susceptible to cavitation, putting the downstream components at risk. A fast approach to predicting the Net Positive Suction Head required was applied to perform a multi-objective optimization on the double-suction centrifugal pump. An L32 (84) orthogonal array was designed to evaluate 8 geometrical parameters at 4 levels each. A two-layer feedforward neural network and genetic algorithm was applied to solve the multi-objective problem into pareto solutions. The results were validated by numerical simulation and compared to the original design. The suction performance was improved by 7.26%, 3.9%, 4.5% and 3.8% at flow conditions 0.6Qd, 0.8Qd, 1.0Qd and 1.2Qd respectively. The efficiency increased by 1.53% 1.0Qd and 1.1% at 0.8Qd. The streamline on the blade surface was improved and the vapor volume fraction of the optimized impeller was much smaller than that of the original impeller. This study established a fast approach to cavitation optimization and a parametric database for both hub and shroud blade angles for double suction centrifugal pump optimization design.},

ABSTRACT = {It is difficult to manually process and analyze large amounts of data. Therefore, to solve a given problem, it is easier to reach the solution by studying the data obtained from the environment of the problem with computational intelligence methods. In this study, pool boiling heat flux was estimated in the isolated bubble regime using two optimization methods (genetic and artificial bee colony algorithm) and three machine learning algorithms (decision tree, artificial neural network, and support vector machine). Six boiling mechanisms containing eighteen different parameters in the genetic and the artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithms were used to calculate overall heat flux of the isolated bubble regime. Support vector machine regression (SVMReg), alternating model tree (ADTree), and multilayer perceptron (MLP) regression only used the heat transfer equation input parameters without heat transfer equations for prediction of pool boiling heat transfer over a horizontal tube. The performance of computational intelligence methods were determined according to the results of error analysis. Mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) error were used to calculate the validity of the predictive model in genetic algorithm, ABC algorithm, SVMReg, MLP regression, and alternating model tree. According to the MAPE error analysis, the accuracy values of MLP regression (0.23) and alternating model tree (0.22) methods were the same. The SVMReg method used for pool boiling heat flux estimation performed better than the other methods, with 0.17 validation error rate of MAPE.},

ABSTRACT = {Waste cooking oils (WCO) recycling companies usually have economic losses for buying WCO not suitable for biodiesel production, e.g., WCO with high free acidity (FA). For this reason, the determination of FA of WCO by near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy was studied in this work to assess its potential for in situ application. To do this, FA of 45 WCO was measured by the classical titration method, which ranged between 0.15 and 3.77%. Then, the NIR spectra from 800 to 2200 nm of these WCO were acquired, and a partial least squares model was built, relating the NIR spectra to FA values. The accuracy of the model was quite high, providing r2 of 0.970 and a ratio of performance to deviation (RPD) of 4.05. Subsequently, a model using an NIR range similar to that provided by portable NIR spectrometers (950–1650 nm) was built. The performance was lower (r2 = 0.905; RPD = 2.66), but even so, with good accuracy, which demonstrates the potential of NIR spectroscopy for the in situ determination of FA of WCO.},

ABSTRACT = {The off-grid solar photovoltaic (PV) system is a significant step towards electrification in the remote rural regions, and it is the most convenient and easy to install technology. However, the strategic problem is in identifying the potential of solar energy and the economic viability in particular regions. This study, therefore, addresses this problem by evaluating the solar energy potential and economic viability for the remote rural regions of the Sindh province, Pakistan. The results recommended that the rural regions of Sindh have suitable solar irradiance to generate electricity. An appropriate tilt angle has been computed for the selected rural regions, which significantly enhances the generation capacity of solar energy. Moreover, economic viability has been undertaken in this study and it was revealed that the off-grid solar PV power generation system provides electricity at the cost of Pakistani Rupees (PKR) 6.87/kWh and is regarded as much cheaper than conventional energy sources, i.e., around PKR 20.79/kWh. Besides, the off-grid solar PV power generation system could mitigate maximum CO2 annually on the condition that all of the selected remote rural regions adopt the off-grid solar PV system. Therefore, this study shall help the government to utilize the off-grid solar PV power generation system in the remote rural regions of Pakistan.},

ABSTRACT = {When assessing energy efficiency, most studies have frequently ignored environmental aspects even though the concept has been widely used in the past. This study evaluates the energy efficiency and environmental performance of South Asia by using DEA (data envelopment analysis) like mathematical composite indicator. We construct a comprehensive set of indicators, including an energy self-sufficiency ratio, energy production over consumption ratio, energy imports, diversification index of energy imports, energy reserve ratio, GDP productivity, energy intensity, per capita energy consumption index, carbon emission index, carbon emission index per unit of energy consumption and share of renewable energy in order to develop an energy efficiency and environmental performance index. Unlike other studies, this study first examines each indicator and then estimates a combined score for each country. The results reveal that Bhutan as a more secure country and Pakistan showed a decreasing trend, while Sri Lanka and India performed satisfactorily. Remarkably, Bangladesh, Nepal and Afghanistan showed a decreasing trend. This study proposes a policy that increases the cross-border trade of renewable energy for long term energy efficiency and environmental performance.},

ABSTRACT = {Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) is an effective method to optimize energy consumption patterns. Since the concept of NILM was proposed, extensive research has focused on energy disaggregation or load identification. The traditional method is to disaggregate mixed signals, and then identify the independent load. This paper proposes a multi-label classification method using Random Forest (RF) as a learning algorithm for non-intrusive load identification. Multi-label classification can be used to determine which categories data belong to. This classification can help to identify the operation states of independent loads from mixed signals without disaggregation. The experiments are conducted in real environment and public data set respectively. Several basic electrical features are selected as the classification feature to build the classification model. These features are also compared to select the most suitable features for classification by feature importance parameters. The classification accuracy and F-score of the proposed method can reach 0.97 and 0.98, respectively.},

ABSTRACT = {In addition to its potential for wave power, wind power, hydropower, and solar power, it can be said that Vietnam is a country with great potential for biomass energy derived from agricultural waste, garbage, and urban wastewater, which are resources widely available across the country. This huge amount of biomass, however, if left untreated, could become a major source of pollution and cause serious impacts on ecosystems (soil, water, and air), as well as on human health. In this research, the authors present a fuzzy multicriteria decision-making model (FMCDM) for optimizing the site selection process for biomass power plants. All of the criteria affecting location selection are identified by experts and literature reviews; in addition, the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) method was utilized so as to identify the weight of all of the criteria in the second stage. Furthermore, the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) is applied for ranking potential locations in the final stage of this research. As a result, Long An (DMU/005) was found to be the best location for building biomass energy in Vietnam. The main contributions of this work include modeling the site selection decision process under fuzzy environment conditions. The proposed approaches also can address the complex problems in site selection; it is also a flexible design model for considering the evaluation criteria, and is applicable to location selection for other industries.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper presents a statistical analysis of wind speed data that can be extremely useful for installing a wind generation as a stand-alone system. The main objective is to define the wind power capacity’s contribution to the adequacy of generation systems for the purpose of selecting wind farm locations at specific sites in Malaysia. The combined Sequential Monte Carlo simulation (SMCS) technique and the Weibull distribution models are employed to demonstrate the impact of wind power in power system reliability. To study this, the Roy Billinton Test System (RBTS) is considered and tested using wind data from two sites in Peninsular Malaysia, Mersing and Kuala Terengganu, and one site, Kudat, in Sabah. The results showed that Mersing and Kudat were best suitable for wind sites. In addition, the reliability indices are compared prior to the addition of the two wind farms to the considered RBTS system. The results reveal that the reliability indices are slightly improved for the RBTS system with wind power generation from both the potential sites.},

ABSTRACT = {The complicated coupling of component design together with energy management has brought a significant challenge to the design, optimization, and control of plug-in hybrid electric buses (PHEBs). This paper proposes an integrated optimization methodology to ensure the optimum performance of a PHEB with a view toward designing and applications. First, a novel co-optimization method is proposed for redesigning the driveline parameters offline, which combines a nondominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) with dynamic programming to eliminate the impact of the coupling between the component design and energy management. Within the new method, the driveline parameters are optimally designed based on a global optimal energy management strategy, and fuel consumption and acceleration time can be respectively reduced by 4.71% and 4.59%. Second, a model-free adaptive control (MFAC) method is employed to realize the online optimal control of energy management on the basis of Pontryagin’s minimum principle (PMP). Particularly, an MFAC controller is used to track the predesigned linear state-of-charge (SOC), and its control variable is regarded as the co-state of the PMP. The main finding is that the co-state generated by the MFAC controller gradually converges on the optimal one derived according to the prior known driving cycles. This implies that the MFAC controller can realize a real-time application of the PMP strategy without acquiring the optimal co-state by offline calculation. Finally, the verification results demonstrated that the proposed MFAC-based method is applicable to both the typical and unknown stochastic driving cycles, meanwhile, and can further improve fuel economy compared to a conventional proportional-integral-differential (PID) controller.},

ABSTRACT = {The widespread penetration of hydrogen in mainstream energy systems requires hydrogen production processes to be economically competent and environmentally efficient. Hydrogen, if produced efficiently, can play a pivotal role in decarbonizing the global energy systems. Therefore, this study develops a framework which evaluates hydrogen production processes and quantifies deficiencies for improvement. The framework integrates slack-based data envelopment analysis (DEA), with fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (FAHP) and fuzzy technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (FTOPSIS). The proposed framework is applied to prioritize the most efficient and sustainable hydrogen production in Pakistan. Eleven hydrogen production alternatives were analyzed under five criteria, including capital cost, feedstock cost, O&M cost, hydrogen production, and CO2 emission. FAHP obtained the initial weights of criteria while FTOPSIS determined the ultimate weights of criteria for each alternative. Finally, slack-based DEA computed the efficiency of alternatives. Among the 11, three alternatives (wind electrolysis, PV electrolysis, and biomass gasification) were found to be fully efficient and therefore can be considered as sustainable options for hydrogen production in Pakistan. The rest of the eight alternatives achieved poor efficiency scores and thus are not recommended.},

ABSTRACT = {Understanding the dynamic nexus between CO2 emissions and economic growth in the sustainable environment helps the economies in developing resources and formulating apposite energy policies. In the recent past, various studies have explored the nexus between CO2 emissions and economic growth. This study, however, investigates the nexus between renewable energy production, CO2 emissions, and economic growth over the period from 1995 to 2016 for seven Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries. Fully Modified Ordinary Least Square (FMOLS) and Dynamic Ordinary Least Square (DOLS) methodologies were used to estimate the long- and short-run relationships. The panel results revealed that renewable energy production has a significant long term effect on CO2 emissions for Vietnam (t = −2.990), Thailand (t = −2.505), and Indonesia (t = −2.515), and economic growth impact for Malaysia (t = 2.050), Thailand (t = −2.001), and the Philippines (t = −2.710). It is, therefore, vital that the ASEAN countries implement policies and strategies that ensure energy saving and continuous economic growth without forsaking the environment. This study, as such, recommends that ASEAN countries should take measures to decrease the reliance on fossil fuels for achieving these objectives. Future research should consider the principles of circular economy and clean energy development mechanisms integrated with renewable energy technologies.},

ABSTRACT = {With the emergence of the smart grid (SG), real-time interaction is favorable for both residents and power companies in optimal load scheduling to alleviate electricity cost and peaks in demand. In this paper, a modular framework is introduced for efficient load scheduling. The proposed framework is comprised of four modules: power company module, forecaster module, home energy management controller (HEMC) module, and resident module. The forecaster module receives a demand response (DR), information (real-time pricing scheme (RTPS) and critical peak pricing scheme (CPPS)), and load from the power company module to forecast pricing signals and load. The HEMC module is based on our proposed hybrid gray wolf-modified enhanced differential evolutionary (HGWmEDE) algorithm using the output of the forecaster module to schedule the household load. Each appliance of the resident module receives the schedule from the HEMC module. In a smart home, all the appliances operate according to the schedule to reduce electricity cost and peaks in demand with the affordable waiting time. The simulation results validated that the proposed framework handled the uncertainties in load and supply and provided optimal load scheduling, which facilitates both residents and power companies.},

ABSTRACT = {The aim of the present study is to investigate the multiple slip effects on magnetohydrodynamic unsteady Maxwell nanofluid flow over a permeable stretching sheet with thermal radiation and thermo-diffusion in the presence of chemical reaction. The governing nonlinear partial differential equations are transformed into a system of coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations with the aid of appropriate similarity variables, and the transformed equations are then solved numerically by using a variational finite element method. The effects of various physical parameters on the velocity, temperature, solutal concentration, and nanoparticle concentration profiles as well as on the skin friction coefficient, rate of heat transfer, and Sherwood number for solutal concentration are discussed by the aid of graphs and tables. An exact solution of flow velocity, skin friction coefficient, and Nusselt number is compared with the numerical solution obtained by FEM and also with numerical results available in the literature. A good agreement between the exact and numerical solution is observed. Also, to justify the convergence of the finite element numerical solution, the calculations are carried out by reducing the mesh size.

ABSTRACT = {Since 1991, from the beginning of the carbon nanotube era, this has been a focus point for investigation due to its synthetic and simple nature. Unique properties like good stiffness, high surface area, and resilience of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been investigated in many engineering applications such as hydrogen storage, composite material, energy storage, electrochemical super-capacitors, transistors, sensors, and field-emitting devices. Keeping in view these applications, we investigate single and multi-walled CNTs nanofluid flow having water as the base fluid between parallel and horizontal rotating plates with microstructure and inertial properties. The thermal radiation effect is considered for variable phenomenon of heat generation/consumption. The principal equations are first symmetrically transformed to a system of nonlinear coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs), and then, Homotopy Analysis Technique (HAM) and numerical method are employed for solving these coupled equations. The obtained analytical and numerical results are explained graphically and through different tables. The HAM and numerical results show an excellent agreement. The Skin friction and the Nusselt number are numerically calculated and then analyzed with the already published results, and these results are found to be in agreement with one another. The impact of important parameters are shown graphically.},

ABSTRACT = {A mathematical model comprising Darcy Forchheimer effects on the 3D nanofluid flow with engine oil as a base fluid containing suspended carbon nanotubes (CNTs) is envisioned. The CNTs are of both types i.e., multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs). The flow is initiated by an exponentially stretched surface. The impacts of Cattaneo–Christov heat flux along with velocity and thermal slip conditions are key factors in the novelty of the defined model. The boundary layer notion is designed to convert the compact form of equations into the component shape. Appropriate transformations lead to differential equations with high nonlinearity. The final non-dimensional system is solved numerically by a “MATLAB” function known as bvp4c. For both CNTs, different graphical sketches are drawn to present the influence of arising parameters versus related profiles. The outcomes show that higher slip parameter boosts the axial velocity, whereas fluid temperature lowers for a sturdier relaxation parameter.},

ABSTRACT = {The islanded mode of the microgrid (MG) operation faces more power quality challenges as compared to grid-tied mode. Unlike the grid-tied MG operation, where the voltage magnitude and frequency of the power system are regulated by the utility grid, islanded mode does not share any connection with the utility grid. Hence, a proper control architecture of islanded MG is essential to control the voltage and frequency, including the power quality and optimal transient response during different operating conditions. Therefore, this study proposes an intelligent and robust controller for islanded MG, which can accomplish the above-mentioned tasks with the optimal transient response and power quality. The proposed controller utilizes the droop control in addition to the back to back proportional plus integral (PI) regulator-based voltage and current controllers in order to accomplish the mentioned control objectives efficiently. Furthermore, the intelligence of the one of the most modern soft computational optimization algorithms called salp swarm optimization algorithm (SSA) is utilized to select the best combination of the PI gains (kp and ki) and dc side capacitance (C), which in turn ensures optimal transient response during the distributed generator (DG) insertion and load change conditions. Finally, to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed control approach, its outcomes are compared with that of the previous approaches used in recent literature on basis of transient response measures, quality of solution and power quality. The results prove the superiority of the proposed control scheme over that of the particle swarm optimization (PSO) and grasshopper optimization algorithm (GOA) based MG controllers for the same operating conditions and system configuration.},

ABSTRACT = {Accurately predicting wind power is crucial for the large-scale grid-connected of wind power and the increase of wind power absorption proportion. To improve the forecasting accuracy of wind power, a hybrid forecasting model using data preprocessing strategy and improved extreme learning machine with kernel (KELM) is proposed, which mainly includes the following stages. Firstly, the Pearson correlation coefficient is calculated to determine the correlation degree between multiple factors of wind power to reduce data redundancy. Then, the complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition (CEEMD) method is adopted to decompose the wind power time series to decrease the non-stationarity, the sample entropy (SE) theory is used to classify and reconstruct the subsequences to reduce the complexity of computation. Finally, the KELM optimized by harmony search (HS) algorithm is utilized to forecast each subsequence, and after integration processing, the forecasting results are obtained. The CEEMD-SE-HS-KELM forecasting model constructed in this paper is used in the short-term wind power forecasting of a Chinese wind farm, and the RMSE and MAE are as 2.16 and 0.39 respectively, which is better than EMD-SE-HS-KELM, HS-KELM, KELM and extreme learning machine (ELM) model. According to the experimental results, the hybrid method has higher forecasting accuracy for short-term wind power forecasting.},

ABSTRACT = {The objective of this article is to investigate the impacts of thermo-diffusion effect on unsteady axisymmetric Casson flow over a time-dependent radially stretching sheet with a multi-slip parameter and the force of chemical reaction. We employed an established similarity transformation to this non-linear partial differential system to convert it into a system of ordinary differential equations. The numerical results are attained for this system by using KELLER-BOX implicit finite difference scheme. It has great reliability and accuracy even a very short time period for computational simulation. The impacts of influential flow parameters on fluid flow are sketched through graphs and the numerical results are thoroughly argued. The temperature, velocity and wall concentration control parameters are analyzed. (i) It is witnessed that chemical reaction is not favorable to enhance the velocity profile. (ii) Multi-slip parameters vary inversely with velocity profile. (iii) The fluid concentration in its boundary layer decreases with the increase of heavier species, the parameter of the reaction rate and the exponent of power law for fluids having Prandtl number = 10.0, 15.0, 20.0 and 25.0. Moreover, the skin-friction-coefficient factor and Nusselt-number are compared with the published work. A strong numerical solution agreement is being observed.},

The evaluation of nanoparticles for current flow problems has been examined by using Buongiorno’s model. The governing equations for the assumed flow problem are constituted under the boundary layer assumptions. After converting these equations in dimensionless form, the famous shooting technique is executed. A detailed physical significance is searched out in the presence of slip features.

ABSTRACT = {With exposure to real-time market pricing structures, consumers would be incentivized to invest in electrical energy storage systems and smart predictive automation of their home energy systems. Smart home automation through optimizing HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) temperature set points, along with distributed energy storage, could be utilized in the process of optimizing the operation of the electric grid. Using electricity prices as decision variables to leverage electrical energy storage and flexible loads can be a valuable tool to optimize the performance of the power grid and reduce electricity costs both on the supply and demand sides. Energy demand prediction is important for proper allocation and utilization of the available resources. Manipulating energy prices to leverage storage and flexible loads through these demand prediction models is a novel idea that needs to be studied. In this paper, different models for proactive prediction of the energy demand for an entire city using different machine learning techniques are presented and compared. The results of the machine learning techniques show that the proposed nonlinear autoregressive with exogenous inputs neural network model resulted in the most accurate predictions. These prediction models pave the way for the demand side to become an important asset for grid regulation by responding to variable price signals through battery energy storage and passive thermal energy storage using HVAC temperature set points.},

ABSTRACT = {Due to growing concerns of global warming, reducing carbon emissions has become one of the major tasks for developing countries to meet the national demand for energy policies. The objective of this study is to measure the energy consumption, carbon emission and economic-environmental efficiency in terms of the environmental performance of the top 20 industrial countries by employing a data envelopment analysis (DEA) model from 2013 to 2017. This study used the trilemma of energy efficiency, CO2 emission efficiency, and environmental efficiency, and also the contribution included the quantitative analysis of 20 industrial countries The results show that the energy efficiency of Australia, China, Japan, Saudi Arabia, and Poland are the best performing countries, whereas Mexico, Indonesia, Russia, and Brazil are identified as least efficient among all 20 countries. Furthermore, Russia’s energy intensity has a maximum score while Poland has a minimum score. Additionally, in the case of CO2 emission efficiency, Brazil, France, and Saudi Arabia are considered as efficient while nine country’s scores were less than 0.5. The results show that most countries exhibit higher performance in economic efficiency than environmental efficiency. The study provides valuable information for energy policy-makers.},

ABSTRACT = {The thermal performances based on the interaction of nanoparticles are the topic of great interest in recent years. In the current continuation, we have utilized the activation energy and thermal radiation consequences in the bioconvection flow of magnetized Oldroyd-B nanoparticles over a stretching cylinder. As a novelty, the second order slip features (Wu’s slip) and convective Nield boundary assumptions are also introduced for the flow situation. The heat performances of nanofluids are captured with an evaluation of the famous Buongiorno’s model which enables us to determine the attractive features of Brownian motion and thermophoretic diffusion. The suggested thermal system is based on the flow velocity, nanoparticles temperature, nanoparticles volume fraction and motile microorganisms. The governing flow equations for the flow problem are constituted with relevant references for which numerically solution is developed via shooting algorithm. A detailed graphically analysis for the assisted flow problem is performed in view of the involved parameters. Although some studies are available in the literature which deals with the flow of various fluids over-stretching cylinder, the phenomenon of bioconvection and other interesting features are not reported yet. Therefore, present scientific computations are performed to fill this gap and the reported results can be more useful for the enhancement of thermal extrusion processes, solar energy systems, and biofuels.},

ABSTRACT = {The boundary layer flow of sodium alginate ( NaAlg ) based ( Cu − CuO ) hybrid nanofluid, over a curved expanding surface, has been investigated. Heat and mass transport phenomena have also been analyzed. Moreover, the impacts of chemical reaction, magnetic field and nonlinear thermal radiation are also a part of this study. This arrangement has great practical relevance, especially in the polymer and chemical industries. We have extended the Bruggeman model to make it capable of capturing the thermal conductivity of ( Cu − CuO ) / NaAlg hybrid nanofluid. We have employed some suitable transformations to obtain the governing system of nonlinear ODEs. Runge − Kutta − Fehlberg algorithm, accompanied by a shooting technique, has been employed to solve the governing system numerically. The changes in the flow and heat transfer distribution, due to various parameters, have been captured and portrayed in the form of graphs. It has been found that the addition of the nanometer-sized materials, significantly boosts the thermal and heat transport properties of the host fluid, and these phenomena seem to be more prominent, in the case of ( Cu − CuO ) / NaAlg hybrid nanofluid.},

ABSTRACT = {Entropy generation and dual solutions are rarely studied in the literature. An analysis is attempted here. More exactly, the present paper looks at the impact of radiation of a micropolar fluid on mixed convective flow containing the titanium alloy Ti6Al4V nanoparticle along with a Riga plate. The study of dual-nature solution for the entropy generation along a Riga surface was not being explored in the literature; therefore, the current model focuses on the dual solutions of this complex nature model. Riga surface is identified as an actuator of electromagnetic in which electrodes are accumulated alternatively. This array produces the behavior of electromagnetic hydrodynamic in the flow field. The transmuted leading equations were worked out through the formula of 3-stage Lobatto IIIA. Influences of exercising enormous parameters on temperature distribution, velocity, and micro rotation fields are portrayed and argued. More than one solution is achieved in opposing flow, while in the phenomenon of assisting flow result is unique. Moreover, due to the micropolar parameter, the separation of the boundary layer is decelerating. It is determined that the entire structure produces the dual-nature solution of the phenomenon of stagnation point flow, and the temperature profile behavior shows the significant enhancement in the thermal conductivity due to the addition of the nanoparticle. The results exposed that liquid velocity is enhanced, and micro rotation is decelerated, by improving the values of Hartmann numbers in both solutions, whereas the temperature field is decelerated in the first solution and accelerated in the second solution.},

ABSTRACT = {The rising global warming concerns and explosive degradation of the environment requires the mainstream utilization of alternative fuels, such as hydroxy gas (HHO) which presents itself as a viable substitute for extracting the benefits of hydrogen. Therefore, an experimental study of the performance and emission characteristics of alternative fuels in contrast to conventional gasoline was undertaken. For experimentation, a spark ignition engine was run on a multitude of fuels comprising of gasoline, Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and hybrid blend of HHO with LPG. The engine was operated at 60% open throttle with engine speed ranging from 1600 rpm to 3400 rpm. Simultaneously, the corresponding performance parameters including brake specific fuel consumption, brake power and brake thermal efficiency were investigated. Emission levels of CO, CO2, HC and NOx were quantified in the specified speed range. To check the suitability of the acquired experimental data, it was subjected to a Weibull distribution fit. Enhanced performance efficiency and reduced emissions were observed with the combustion of the hybrid mixture of LPG with HHO in comparison to LPG: on average, brake power increased by 7% while the brake specific fuel consumption reduced by 15%. On the other hand, emissions relative to LPG decreased by 21%, 9% and 21.8% in cases of CO, CO2, and unburned hydrocarbons respectively. Incorporating alternative fuels would not only imply reduced dependency on conventional fuels but would also contribute to their sustainability for future generations. Simultaneously, the decrease in harmful environmental pollutants would help to mitigate and combat the threats of climate change.},

As such, a similarity solution is engaged to transform the governing partial differential equations to the ordinary differential equations. A collocation method, namely the bvp4c function in the MATLAB software solves the reduced system, numerically. Two different numerical solutions were identified for the cases of assisting and opposing flows. The stability analysis was conducted to test the stability of the non-uniqueness solutions. The increment of the thermal radiation effect affects the rate of heat transfer to decrease. The stability analysis conveyed that the upper branch solution is stable and vice versa for the other solution.},

ABSTRACT = {Accurately predicting wind power plays a vital part in site selection, large-scale grid connection, and the safe and efficient operation of wind power generation equipment.

Considering the important impact of wind speed on power, the average value, the maximum difference and the average change rate of daily wind speed of each historical day are used as the selection criteria to select similar days by using DBSCAN algorithm and Euclidean distance. The short-term wind power prediction is carried out by using the similar day data pre-processed and unprocessed, respectively, as the input of back propagation neural network optimized by genetic algorithm (GA-BP neural network). Analysis of the results proves the practicability and efficiency of the prediction model and the important role of outlier identification and correction in improving the accuracy of wind power prediction.},

ABSTRACT = {Waste heat recovery plays an important role in energy source management. Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) can be used to recover low-temperature waste heat. In the present work a sample power plant waste heat was used to operate an ORC. First, two pure working fluids were selected based on their merits. Four possible thermodynamic models were considered in the analysis. They were defined based on where the condenser and evaporator temperatures are located. Four main thermal parameters, evaporator temperature, condenser temperature, degree of superheat and pinch point temperature difference were taken as key parameters. Levelized energy cost values and exergy efficiency were calculated as the optimization criteria. To optimize exergy and economic aspects of the system, Strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm II (SPEA II) was implemented. The Pareto frontier solutions were ordered and chose by TOPSIS. Model 3 outperformed all other models. After evaluating exergy efficiency by mixture mass fraction, R245fa [0.6]/Pentane [0.4] selected as the most efficient working fluid. Finally, every component’s role in determining the levelized energy cost and the exergy efficiency and were discussed. The turbine, condenser and evaporator were found as the costliest components.},

ABSTRACT = {The improvement of the overall performance of hydraulic pumps is the basis of intelligent hydraulics. Taking the straight line conjugate internal meshing gear pump as the research object, the theoretical flow rate and the geometric flow pulsation rate equations are established in this study through the volume change method. The change laws of the gear pair’s geometric parameters on the theoretical flow rate and the geometric flow pulsation rate are studied. The simulation model of the internal flow channel is established, and the influence factors and the influence degree of the flow pulsation and average flow rate are analyzed. The high-pressure positive displacement pump test system is also designed and built. The performance evaluations are conducted, and the experimental results are analyzed. The results show that the periodic change of the meshing point position is the root cause of the geometric flow pulsation. The theoretical flow rate and the geometric flow pulsation rate are 103.71 L/min and 1.76%, respectively. To increase the theoretical flow rate whilst decreasing the geometric flow pulsation rate, the tip circle radius of the external gear should be increased as much as possible within the allowable range of the design calculation. Amongst the three influencing factors that produce flow pulsation, the oil compressibility has no effect on the flow pulsation. The uneven internal leakage is the main factor, and the geometric flow pulsation only accounts for a small proportion. The internal leakage reduces the simulated flow rate by 3.59 L/min. The difference between the experimental and simulated flow rates is less than 2%. Within the allowable speed range, the rotation speed of the external gear should be increased as much as possible to increase the average flow rate and the volumetric efficiency.},

A mathematical model was developed using dynamic equations of a DMFC. Simulation of a DMFC model using MATLAB software was carried out to identify the most influencing process variables, namely cell temperature, methanol flow rate and methanol concentration during a DMFC operation. Simulation results were recorded and analyzed. It was observed from the results that the cell temperature was the most influencing process variable in the DMFC operation, more so than the methanol flow rate and the methanol concentration. In the DMFC, real-time experimentation was carried out at different cell temperatures to find out the optimum temperature at which maximum power density was obtained. The results obtained in simulation and the experiment were compared and it was concluded that the temperature was the most influencing process variable and 333K was the optimum operating temperature required to achieve the most productive performance in power density of the DMFC.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper explores a possible waste-based economy transition strategy. Digestate from the organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW) is considered, as well as a low-added value product to be properly valorized. In this regard, air gasification may be used to produce syngas. In this work, the production of methanol, hydrogen, or electricity from digestate-derived syngas was assessed by ChemCAD process simulation software. The process scheme of methanol production comprises the following parts: water gas shift (WGS) with carbon capture and storage units (CCS), methanol synthesis, and methanol purification. In the case of hydrogen production, after WGS-CCS, hydrogen was purified from residual nitrogen by pressure swing absorption (PSA). Finally, for electricity production, the digestate-derived syngas was used as fuel in an internal combustion engine. The main objective of this work is to compare the proposed scenarios in terms of CO2 emission intensity and the effect of CO2 storage. In particular, CCS units were used for methanol or hydrogen production with the aim of obtaining high equilibrium yield toward these products. On the basis of 100 kt/year of digestate, results show that the global CO2 savings were 80, 71, and 69 ktCO2eq/year for electricity, methanol, and hydrogen production, respectively. If carbon storage was considered, savings of about 105 and 99 ktCO2eq/year were achieved with methanol and hydrogen production, respectively. The proposed scenarios may provide an attractive option for transitioning into methanol or hydrogen economy of the future.},

ABSTRACT = {Election Algorithm (EA) is a novel variant of the socio-political metaheuristic algorithm, inspired by the presidential election model conducted globally. In this research, we will investigate the effect of Bipolar EA in enhancing the learning processes of a Hopfield Neural Network (HNN) to generate global solutions for Random k Satisfiability (RANkSAT) logical representation. Specifically, this paper utilizes a bipolar EA incorporated with the HNN in optimizing RANkSAT representation. The main goal of the learning processes in our study is to ensure the cost function of RANkSAT converges to zero, indicating the logic function is satisfied. The effective learning phase will affect the final states of RANkSAT and determine whether the final energy is a global minimum or local minimum. The comparison will be made by adopting the same network and logical rule with the conventional learning algorithm, namely, exhaustive search (ES) and genetic algorithm (GA), respectively. Performance evaluation analysis is conducted on our proposed hybrid model and the existing models based on the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Sum of Squared Error (SSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAPE). The result demonstrates the capability of EA in terms of accuracy and effectiveness as the learning algorithm in HNN for RANkSAT with a different number of neurons compared to ES and GA.},

ABSTRACT = {Pipelines are like a lifeline that is vital to a nation’s economic sustainability; as such, pipelines need to be monitored to optimize their performance as well as reduce the product losses incurred in the transportation of petroleum chemicals. A significant number of pipes would be underground; it is of immediate concern to identify and analyse the level of corrosion and assess the quality of a pipe. Therefore, this study intends to present the development of an intelligent model that predicts the condition of crude oil pipeline cantered on specific factors such as metal loss anomalies (over length, width and depth), wall thickness, weld anomalies and pressure flow. The model is developed using Feed-Forward Back Propagation Network (FFBPN) based on historical inspection data from oil and gas fields. The model was trained using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm by changing the number of hidden neurons to achieve promising results in terms of maximum Coefficient of determination (R2) value and minimum Mean Squared Error (MSE). It was identified that a strong R2 value depends on the number of hidden neurons. The model developed with 16 hidden neurons accurately predicted the Estimated Repair Factor (ERF) value with an R2 value of 0.9998. The remaining useful life (RUL) of a pipeline is estimated based on the metal loss growth rate calculations. The deterioration profiles of considered factors are generated to identify the individual impact on pipeline condition. The proposed FFBPN was validated with other published models for its robustness and it was found that FFBPN performed better than the previous approaches. The deterioration curves were generated and it was found that pressure has major negative affect on pipeline condition and weld girth has a minor negative affect on pipeline condition. This study can help petroleum and natural gas industrial operators assess the life condition of existing pipelines and thus enhances their inspection and rehabilitation forecasting.},

ABSTRACT = {In this study, the response surface methodology (RSM) and desirability function (DF) were utilized to optimize the recycling conditions of aluminum (AA6061) chips, in the presence of particulate alumina (Al2O3), to obtain a metal matrix composite of recycled aluminum (MMC-AlR) using hot press forging processes. The effects of temperature (430–530 °C) and holding time (60–120 min) were investigated. The introduction of 2.0 wt. % of Al2O3 to the aluminum matrix was based on preliminary research and some pilot tests. This study employed the 2k factorial design of experiments that should satisfy the operating temperatures (T) of 430 °C and 530 °C with holding times (t) of 60 min and 120 min. The central composite design (CCD) was utilized for RSM with the axial and center point to evaluate the responses to the ultimate tensile strength (UTS), elongation to failure (ETF), and microhardness (MH). Based on RSM, with the desirability of 97.6%, the significant parameters T = 530 °C and t = 120 min were suggested to yield an optimized composite performance with UTS = 317.99 MPa, ETF = 20.45%, and MH = 86.656 HV. Three confirmation runs were performed based on the suggested optimum parameters, and the error revealed was less than 25%. The mathematical models suggested by RSM could adequately describe the MMC-AlR responses of the factors being investigated.},

ABSTRACT = {Global human pollutant activities have raised greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, which have directly affected the climate. Fossil fuel-based energy has brought a negative impact on the environment and is considered one of the largest sources of GHG emissions. It is envisaged that GHG emissions will increase in the future due to rapid population growth and industrialization. Thus, it is imperative to mitigate climate variability and reduce GHGs by adopting renewable energy (RE) sources for electricity generation. In this regard, the multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) process would serve the purpose of framing out energy policy to analyze these environmentally friendly energy sources. This study uses an integrated decision methodology—a combination of Delphi, fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (FAHP), and the fuzzy weighted aggregated sum product assessment (FWASPAS)—for the adoption of RE sources for electricity generation in Turkey. Initially, the study identified five main criteria and seventeen sub-criteria using the Delphi method. Then, the FAHP method was used to evaluate and rank the main criteria and sub-criteria. Finally, the FWASPAS method was used to assess and prioritize five major RE sources for electricity generation. The FAHP analysis indicated that political criteria are the most influential, followed by economic and technical criteria. Further, the FWASPAS method revealed that wind energy is the most significant option for electricity generation. This decision-making process can help the energy planners to utilize RE sources for sustainable development.},

ABSTRACT = {Windcatchers are considered as promising passive ventilation and cooling strategy, but the ventilation performance of this system is still of concern in areas with low speed and unpredictable winds. The air short circuiting in windcatchers can reduce its ventilation performance and ability to introduce clean air and remove stale air. The current work aimed to evaluate the indoor environmental quality (IEQ) performance of a two-sided windcatcher fitted with an anti-short-circuit device (ASCD) for improving its performance in low wind speed conditions. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations were performed for different ASCD configurations. The CFD method was verified using grid-sensitivity analysis and validated by comparing the simulation results with wind tunnel data. The results indicated that the average difference between CFD results and previous experimentation was below 10%, therefore indicating good agreement. Building on the findings of the previous research, the study focused on evaluating the impact of the length of ASCD on the achieved fresh air supply rates and air change rate. The length of the ASCD was varied between 5 cm to 50 cm, while the angle was maintained at 80°. The shorter ASCD was still able to minimize the fresh supply airflow short-circuiting to the exhaust stream, and at the same time, it would also require a smaller ceiling space for installation and lower material cost. Hence, the 15 cm ASCD with 80° angle was selected for further analysis in this study. Then, consideration of low wind speed and various directions were studied to evaluate the ventilation performance of windcatcher with ASCD. The study simulated wind speeds between 0.5–2 m/s and two wind directions. Based on the assessment of IEQ factors, including mean age of air and percentage of dead zone, a 0° incident angle demonstrated slightly better results. The achieved fresh air supply rates ranged between 180 L/s to 890 L/s in 45° wind angle, while, for 0°, these values were from 160 L/s to 642 L/s. Likewise, the range of air change rates (ACH) was from 8 ACH to 32 ACH in 0° wind angle and increased to 9 ACH and then to 45 ACH in 45° wind angle.},

ABSTRACT = {Graphene nanofluids have attracted the attention of many researchers because of a variety of remarkable properties such as extraordinary electronic transport properties, high thermal conductivity, and large specific surface areas. This paper investigates the shape effects of nanoparticles on the Marangoni boundary layer of graphene–water nanofluid flow and heat transfer over a porous medium under the influences of the suction parameter. The graphene–water nanofluid flow was contained with various shapes of nanoparticles, namely sphere, column, platelet, and lamina. The problem is modeled in form of partial differential equations (PDES) with boundary conditions. The governing transport equations are converted into dimensionless form with the help of some suitable nondimensional variables. The solution of the problem was found numerically using the NDSolve technique of Mathematica 10.3 software. In addition, the numerical solutions were also compared with analytical results. The homotopy analysis method (HAM) is used to calculate the analytical results. The results show that lamina-shaped nanoparticles have better performance on temperature distribution while sphere-shaped nanoparticles are more efficient for heat transfer than other shapes of nanoparticles.},

ABSTRACT = {The combustion emissions of the hydrogen-fueled engines are very clean, but the problems of abnormal combustion and high NOx emissions limit their applications. Nowadays hydrogen engines use exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) technology to control the intensity of premixed combustion and reduce the NOx emissions. This study aims at improving the abnormal combustion and decreasing the NOx emissions of the hydrogen engine by applying a three-dimensional (3D) computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model of a single-cylinder hydrogen-fueled engine equipped with an EGR system. The results indicated that peak in-cylinder pressure continuously increased with the increase of the ignition advance angle and was closer to the top dead center (TDC). In addition, the mixture was burned violently near the theoretical air–fuel ratio, and the combustion duration was shortened. Moreover, the NOx emissions, the average pressure, and the in-cylinder temperature decreased as the EGR ratio increased. Furthermore, increasing the EGR ratio led to an increase in the combustion duration and a decrease in the peak heat release rate. EGR system could delay the spontaneous combustion reaction of the end-gas and reduce the probability of knocking. The pressure rise rate was controlled and the in-cylinder hot spots were reduced by the EGR system, which could suppress the occurrence of the pre-ignition in the hydrogen engine.},

ABSTRACT = {The photovoltaic (PV) industry is an important part of the renewable energy industry. With the growing use of PV systems, interest in their operation and maintenance (O&M) is increasing. In this regard, analyses of power generation efficiency and inverter efficiency are very important. The first step in efficiency analysis is solar power estimation based on environment sensor data. In this study, solar power was estimated using a univariate linear regression model. The estimated solar power data were cross-validated with the actual solar power data obtained from the inverter. The results provide information on the power generation efficiency of the inverter. The linear estimation model developed in this study was validated using a single PV system. It is possible to apply the coefficients presented in this study to other PV systems, even though the nature and error rates of the collected data may vary depending on the inverter manufacturer. To apply the proposed model to PV systems with different power generation capacities, reconstructing the model according to the power generation capacity is necessary.},

ABSTRACT = {Hybrid Renewable Energy Systems (HRESs) have been touted as an appropriate way for supplying electricity to remote and off-grid areas in developing countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), where rural electrification challenges are the most pronounced. This study proposes a two-step methodology for optimizing and analyzing a stand-alone photovoltaic/wind/battery/diesel hybrid system to meet the electricity needs of Fanisua, an off-grid and remote village of northern Nigeria. In the first step, the MATLAB environment was used to run simulations and optimize the system via the genetic algorithm. Then, techno-economic and emissions analysis was carried out in the second step to compare the proposed system to the existing traditional modes of rural electrification in sub-Saharan Africa, namely, the grid-extension and diesel generator. The break-even distance parameter was adopted in the comparison with grid-extension. Besides, the hypothetical project of replacing the diesel generator by the optimal system was analyzed using the Simple Payback Period (SPP) and Net Present Value (NPV) parameters. The resulting optimal design architecture included an 89.271-kW photovoltaic array, a 100.31-W diesel generator, and 148 batteries with a total annualized cost (TAC) and cost of energy (COE) of USD 43,807 and USD 0.25/kWh, respectively. The break-even distance found was 16.2 km, while the NPV and SPP of the hypothetical project were USD 572,382 and 2.8 years, respectively. The savings in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions of the proposed system compared to the grid extension and the diesel generator were found to be 85,401.08 kg/year and 122,062.85 kg/year, respectively. This study highlighted the role that solar PV-based HRESs could play in the sustainable electricity supply in rural areas of sub-Saharan Africa.},

ABSTRACT = {Solar photovoltaic (PV) direct current (DC) microgrids have gained significant popularity during the last decade for low cost and sustainable rural electrification. Various system architectures have been practically deployed, however, their assessment concerning system sizing, losses, and operational efficiency is not readily available in the literature. Therefore, in this research work, a mathematical framework for the comparative analysis of various architectures of solar photovoltaic-based DC microgrids for rural applications is presented. The compared architectures mainly include (a) central generation and central storage architecture, (b) central generation and distributed storage architecture, (c) distributed generation and central storage architecture, and (d) distributed generation and distributed storage architecture. Each architecture is evaluated for losses, including distribution losses and power electronic conversion losses, for typical power delivery from source end to the load end in the custom village settings. Newton–Raphson method modified for DC power flow was used for distribution loss analysis, while power electronic converter loss modeling along with the Matlab curve-fitting tool was used for the evaluation of power electronic losses. Based upon the loss analysis, a framework for DC microgrid components (PV and battery) sizing was presented and also applied to the various architectures under consideration. The case study results show that distributed generation and distributed storage architecture with typical usage diversity of 40% is the most feasible architecture from both system sizing and operational cost perspectives and is 13% more efficient from central generation and central storage architecture for a typical village of 40 houses. The presented framework and the analysis results will be useful in selecting an optimal DC microgrid architecture for future rural electrification implementations.},

Graphite oxide (GO), single and multiple walls carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs and MWCNTs) nanoparticles have been incorporated to support the heat transfer performances of the host fluid. The Keller box technique is employed to solve the transformed governing equations. Our numerical findings were in an excellent agreement with the preceding literature. Graphical results of the effect of the relevant parameters on some physical quantities related to examine the behavior of Casson nanofluid flow were obtained, and they confirmed that an augmentation in Casson parameter results in a decline in local skin friction, velocity, or temperature, as well as leading to an increment in local Nusselt number. Furthermore, MWCNTs are the most efficient in improving the rate of heat transfer and velocity, and they possess the lowest temperature.},

ABSTRACT = {Transitioning to a renewable energy economy requires the widespread integration of solar and wind power, which are intermittent, into the electricity grid. To this goal, it is paramount to develop cost-competitive, reliable, location-independence, and large-scale energy storage technologies. The hydrogen bromine flow battery (HBFB) is a promising technology given the abundant material availability and its high power density. Here, the aim is to perform a comprehensive techno-economic analysis of a 500 kW nominal power/5 MWh HBFB storage system, based on the levelized cost of storage approach. Then, we systematically analyze stack and system components costs for both the current base and a future scenario (2030). We find that, for the base case, HBFB capital investments are competitive to Li-ion battery technology, highlighting the potential of large-scale HBFB market introduction. Improving the stack performance and reducing the stack and system costs are expected to result in ~62% reduction potential in capital investments. The base-case levelized cost of storage, $0.074/kWh, is sufficiently low for a wind-solar storage system to compete with a fossil-based power plant, with potential for reduction to $0.034/kWh in the future scenario. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the levelized cost of storage is most sensitive towards the stack lifetime, which motivates research efforts into advanced electrocatalysts with higher durability and ion-exchange membranes with improved selectivity.},

ABSTRACT = {The hybrid renewable energy system is a promising and significant technology for clean and sustainable island power supply. Among the abundant ocean energy sources, tidal current energy appears to be very valuable due to its excellent predictability and stability, particularly compared with the intermittent wind and solar energy. In this paper, an island hybrid energy microgrid composed of photovoltaic, wind, tidal current, battery and diesel is constructed according to the actual energy sources. A sizing optimization method based on improved multi-objective grey wolf optimizer (IMOGWO) is presented to optimize the hybrid energy system. The proposed method is applied to determine the optimal system size, which is a multi-objective problem including the minimization of annualized cost of system (CACS) and deficiency of power supply probability (DPSP). MATLAB software is utilized to program and simulate the hybrid energy system. Optimization results confirm that IMOGWO is feasible to optimally size the system, and the energy management strategy effectively matches the requirements of system operation. Furthermore, comparison of hybrid systems with and without tidal current turbines is undertaken to confirm that the utilization of tidal current turbines can contribute to enhancing system reliability and reducing system investment, especially in areas with abundant tidal energy sources.},

Biomass supply and overall energy consumptions are important issues determining the overall biorefinery sustainability. Low-profit lands appear to be a potential option for the sustainable production of raw materials without competition with the food chain. Cardoon particularly matches these characteristics, thanks to the rapid growth and the economy of the cultivation and harvesting steps. An integrated biorefinery processing 60 kton/y cardoon lignocellulosic biomass for the production of 1,4-butanediol (bio-BDO) is presented and discussed in this work. After designing the biorefinery flowsheet, the mass and energy balances were calculated. The results indicated that the energy recovery system has been designed to almost completely cover the entire energy requirement of the BDO production process. Despite the lower supply of electricity, the energy recovery system can cover around 78% of the total electricity demand. Instead, the thermal energy recovery system was able to satisfy the overall demand of the sugar production process entirely, while BDO purification columns require high-pressure steam. The thermal energy recovery system can cover around 83% of the total thermal demand. Finally, a cradle-to-gate simplified environmental assessment was conducted in order to evaluate the environmental impact of the process in terms of carbon footprint. The carbon footprint value calculated for the entire production process of BDO was 2.82 kgCO2eq/kgBDO. The cultivation phase accounted for 1.94 kgCO2eq/kgBDO, the transport had very little impact, only for 0.067 kgCO2eq/kgBDO, while the biorefinery phase contributes for 0.813 kgCO2eq/kgBDO.},

ABSTRACT = {Although alkaline water electrolysis (AWE) is the most widespread technology for hydrogen production by electrolysis, its electrochemical and fluid dynamic optimization has rarely been addressed simultaneously using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation. In this regard, a two-dimensional (2D) CFD model of an AWE cell has been developed using COMSOL® software and then experimentally validated. The model involves transport equations for both liquid and gas phases as well as equations for the electric current conservation. This multiphysics approach allows the model to simultaneously analyze the fluid dynamic and electrochemical phenomena involved in an electrolysis cell. The electrical response was evaluated in terms of polarization curve (voltage vs. current density) at different operating conditions: temperature, electrolyte conductivity, and electrode-diaphragm distance. For all cases, the model fits very well with the experimental data with an error of less than 1% for the polarization curves. Moreover, the model successfully simulates the changes on gas profiles along the cell, according to current density, electrolyte flow rate, and electrode-diaphragm distance. The combination of electrochemical and fluid dynamics studies provides comprehensive information and makes the model a promising tool for electrolysis cell design.},

ABSTRACT = {With the vigorous promotion of new energy sources and the development of vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology, the influence of the V2G mode should be considered in the joint optimal allocation of Distributed Generation (DG) and electric vehicle charging stations (EVCSs). The timing characteristics of the intermittent output of DG, conventional demand for load, and charging load of the electric vehicle (EV) are considered, as is its participation in grid interaction to examine the construction of typical scenarios and the EV cluster dispatching strategy. From the perspective of comprehensively planning the coordination of the distribution network, a DG-EVCSs bi-level joint planning model is established under the peak and valley price mechanism, with the sub-objectives of obtaining a comprehensive profit and high quality of voltage, curbing system load fluctuations, and satisfactorily charging the EV. An improved harmony particle swarm optimization algorithm is proposed to solve the bi-level model. The proposed method was tested on the IEEE-33 and the PG&E-69 (Pacific Gas and Electric Company) bus distribution systems, and the results show that the optimized configuration model that considers the V2G mode can improve the overall performance of the planning scheme, promote the use of clean energy, smoothen the load fluctuations of the system, and improve the quality of voltage and charging satisfaction of EV users.},

ABSTRACT = {The heat transfer, friction factor, and collector efficiency are estimated experimentally for multi-walled carbon nanotubes+Fe3O4 hybrid nanofluid flows in a solar flat plate collector under thermosyphon circulation. The combined technique of in-situ growth and chemical coprecipitation was utilized to synthesize the multi-walled carbon nanotubes+Fe3O4 hybrid nanoparticles. The experiments were carried out at volume flow rates from 0.1 to 0.75 L/min and various concentrations from 0.05% to 0.3%. The viscosity and thermal conductivity of the hybrid nanofluids were experimentally measured at different temperatures and concentrations. Due to the improved thermophysical properties of the hybrid nanofluids, the collector achieved better thermal efficiency. Results show that the maximum thermal conductivity and viscosity enhancements are 28.46% and 50.4% at 0.3% volume concentration and 60 °C compared to water data. The Nusselt number, heat transfer coefficient, and friction factor are augmented by 18.68%, 39.22%, and 18.91% at 0.3% volume concentration and 60 °C over water data at the maximum solar radiation. The collector thermal efficiency improved by 28.09% at 0.3 vol. % at 13:00 h daytime and a Reynolds number of 1413 over water data. Empirical correlations were developed for friction factor and Nusselt number.},

ABSTRACT = {The question of electromobility is greatly discussed theme of the present especially in connection with the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. In order to fulfill decarbonization targets, incentives of many countries lead to the support of electromobility. In this paper we ask to which extend are Visegrád Group countries prepared for the widespread utilization of electric cars and define a new coefficient K called the infrastructural country electromobility coefficient. Its computing is covered by appropriate analysis and calculations done previously. Several indices that keep particular information about the state of preparation for electromobility are defined and debated here, as well. Their product forms the coefficient K. Obtained results include outcomes and discussion regarding the level of infrastructural electromobility preparedness for the chosen states, among which we extra focus on the position of Slovakia compared to the European Union average and European electromobility leaders. Based on the data obtained, we found out that the stage of preparation of Slovakia for electromobility among Visegrad Group countries is rather good, although it is far behind the European Union leaders. We realized that there was a rapid growth of electromobility infrastructure in Slovak Republic in the last five years as its infrastructural country electromobility coefficient grew 334 times.},

ABSTRACT = {Generally, energy management in smart buildings is formulated by mixed-integer linear programming, with different optimization goals. The most targeted goals are the minimization of the electricity consumption cost, the electricity consumption value from external power grid, and peak load smoothing. All of these objectives are desirable in a smart building, however, in most of the related works, just one of these mentioned goals is considered and investigated. In this work, authors aim to consider two goals via a multi-objective framework. In this regard, a multi-objective mixed-binary linear programming is presented to minimize the total energy consumption cost and peak load in collective residential buildings, considering the scheduling of the charging/discharging process for electric vehicles and battery energy storage system. Then, the Pascoletti-Serafini scalarization approach is used to obtain the Pareto front solutions of the presented multi-objective model. In the final, the performance of the proposed model is analyzed and reported by simulating the model under two different scenarios. The results show that the total consumption cost of the residential building has been reduced 35.56% and the peak load has a 45.52% reduction.},

ABSTRACT = {The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of biomass micronization on energy production using a converted aircraft turbine AI-20. The test system was constructed in such a way to ensure continuous operation for a given period of time and was equipped in a chopper, a flail mill, and a micronizer. The turbine had the ability to produce energy from solid biomass and as well conventional fuels. The most energy was obtained from absolutely dry sunflower husk (17.27 MJ/kg) and the least from Poplar (7.82 MJ/kg). Miscanthus, wheat straw, and hay (approximately 17 MJ/kg) showed high values of energy production. In addition, the thermal decomposition of wheat straw at 350 and 450 °C was studied using the Py-GC/MS technique in a helium atmosphere to determine the gaseous compounds formed during biomass gasification under anaerobic conditions. The results obtained indicate the formation of compounds classified as phenols (vanillin, hydroxymethylfurfural).},

ABSTRACT = {The output generations of renewable energy sources (RES) depend basically on climatic conditions, which are the main reason for their uncertain nature. As a result, the performance and security of distribution systems can be significantly worsened with high RES penetration. To address these issues, an analytical study was carried out by considering different penetration strategies for RES in the radial distribution system. Moreover, a bi-stage procedure was proposed for optimal planning of RES penetration. The first stage was concerned with calculating the optimal RES locations and sites. This stage aimed to minimize the voltage variations in the distribution system. In turn, the second stage was concerned with obtaining the optimal setting of the voltage control devices to improve the voltage profile. The multi-objective cat swarm optimization (MO-CSO) algorithm was proposed to solve the bi-stages optimization problems for enhancing the distribution system performance. Furthermore, the impact of the RES penetration level and their uncertainty on a distribution system voltage were studied. The proposed method was tested on the IEEE 34-bus unbalanced distribution test system, which was analyzed using backward/forward sweep power flow for unbalanced radial distribution systems. The proposed method provided satisfactory results for increasing the penetration level of RES in unbalanced distribution networks.},

ABSTRACT = {This article aims to develop a proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzer emulator. This emulator is realized through an equivalent electrical scheme. It allows taking into consideration the dynamic operation of PEM electrolyzers, which is generally neglected in the literature. PEM electrolyzer dynamics are reproduced by the use of supercapacitors, due to the high value of the equivalent double-layer capacitance value. Steady-state and dynamics operations are investigated in this work. The design criteria are addressed. The PEM electrolyzer emulator is validated by using a 400-W commercial PEM electrolyzer. This emulator is conceived to test new DC-DC converters to supply the PEM ELs and their control as well, avoiding the risk to damage a real electrolyzer for experiment purposes. The proposed approach is valid both for a single cell and for the whole stack emulation.},

ABSTRACT = {Hydrogen-fueled fuel cells are considered one of the key strategies to tackle the achievement of fully-sustainable mobility. The transportation sector is paying significant attention to the development and industrialization of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) to be introduced alongside batteries, reaching the goal of complete de-carbonization. In this paper a multi-phase, multi-component, and non-isothermal 3D-CFD model is presented to simulate the fluid, heat, and charge transport processes developing inside a hydrogen/air PEMFC with a serpentine-type gas distributor. Model results are compared against experimental data in terms of polarization and power density curves, including an improved formulation of exchange current density at the cathode catalyst layer, improving the simulation results’ accuracy in the activation-dominated region. Then, 3D-CFD fields of reactants’ delivery to the active electrochemical surface, reaction rates, temperature distributions, and liquid water formation are analyzed, and critical aspects of the current design are commented, i.e., the inhomogeneous use of the active surface for reactions, limiting the produced current and inducing gradients in thermal and reaction rate distribution. The study shows how a complete multi-dimensional framework for physical and chemical processes of PEMFC can be used to understand limiting processes and to guide future development.},

ABSTRACT = {Recently, the use of diverse renewable energy resources has been intensively expanding due to their technical and environmental benefits. One of the important issues in the modeling and simulation of renewable energy resources is the extraction of the unknown parameters in photovoltaic models. In this regard, the parameters of three models of photovoltaic (PV) cells are extracted in this paper with a new optimization method called turbulent flow of water-based optimization (TFWO). The applications of the proposed TFWO algorithm for extracting the optimal values of the parameters for various PV models are implemented on the real data of a 55 mm diameter commercial R.T.C. France solar cell and experimental data of a KC200GT module. Further, an assessment study is employed to show the capability of the proposed TFWO algorithm compared with several recent optimization techniques such as the marine predators algorithm (MPA), equilibrium optimization (EO), and manta ray foraging optimization (MRFO). For a fair performance evaluation, the comparative study is carried out with the same dataset and the same computation burden for the different optimization algorithms. Statistical analysis is also used to analyze the performance of the proposed TFWO against the other optimization algorithms. The findings show a high closeness between the estimated power–voltage (P–V) and current–voltage (I–V) curves achieved by the proposed TFWO compared with the experimental data as well as the competitive optimization algorithms, thanks to the effectiveness of the developed TFWO solution mechanism.},

ABSTRACT = {In modern power systems, power transformers are considered vital components that can ensure the grid’s continuous operation. In this regard, studying the breakdown in the transformer becomes necessary, especially its insulating system. Hence, in this study, Box–Behnken design (BBD) was used to introduce a prediction model of the breakdown voltage (VBD) for the transformer insulating oil in the presence of different barrier effects for point/plane gap arrangement with alternating current (AC) voltage. Interestingly, the BBD reduces the required number of experiments and their costs to examine the barrier parameter effect on the existing insulating oil VBD. The investigated variables were the barrier location in the gap space (a/d)%, the relative permittivity of the barrier materials (εr), the hole radius in the barrier (hr), the barrier thickness (th), and the barrier inclined angle (θ). Then, only 46 experiment runs are required to build the BBD model for the five barrier variables. The BBD prediction model was verified based on the statistical study and some other experiment runs. Results explained the influence of the inclined angle of the barrier and its thickness on the VBD. The obtained results indicated that the designed BBD model provides less than a 5% residual percentage between the measured and predicted VBD. The findings illustrated the high accuracy and robustness of the proposed insulating oil breakdown voltage predictive model linked with diverse barrier effects.},

ABSTRACT = {Condition assessment of insulating oil is crucial for the reliable long-term operation of power equipment, especially power transformers. Under thermal aging, critical degradation in oil properties, including chemical, physical, and dielectric properties, occurs due to the generation of aging byproducts. Ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy was recently proposed for the condition assessment of mineral oil. However, this absorption technique may involve all electronic states of the investigated material which typically yield a broad spectrum, and thus cannot precisely reflect the electronic structure of aged oil samples. It also cannot be implemented as an online sensor of oil degradation. In this paper, photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy is introduced, for the first time, for effective condition assessment of insulating oil. The PL technique involves emission processes that only occur between a narrow band of electronic states that are occupied by thermalized electrons and consequently yields a spectrum that is much narrower than that of the absorption spectrum. Aged oil samples with different aging extents were prepared in the laboratory using accelerated aging tests at 120 °C, under which 1 day of laboratory aging is equivalent to approximately 1 year of aging in the field. These aged samples were then tested using PL spectroscopy with a wavelength ranging from 150 nm to 1500 nm. Two main parameters were evaluated for quantitative analysis of PL spectra: The full width at half-maximum and the enclosed area under the PL spectra. These parameters were correlated to the aging extent. In conjunction with PL spectroscopy, the aged oil samples were tested for the dielectric dissipation factor as an indication of the number of aging byproducts. Interestingly, we find a correlation between the PL spectra and the dielectric dissipation factor. The results of PL spectroscopy were compared to those of UV-Vis spectroscopy for the same samples and the parameters extracted from PL spectra were compared to the aging b-products extracted from UV-Vis spectra. Finally, the corresponding physical mechanisms were discussed considering the obtained results and the spectral shift for each spectrum. It was proved that PL spectroscopy is a promising technique for the condition assessment of insulating oil when compared to conventional transformer oil assessment measuring techniques and even to other optical absorption techniques.},

ABSTRACT = {The powertrain system is critical to the reliability of a battery electric vehicle (BEV). However, the BEV powertrain is a complex system; it includes the motor, motor controller, power distribution unit, battery system, etc. The failure of any of these components may result in the failure of the entire powertrain system and eventually cause serious traffic accidents on the road. However, how much does each component affect the reliability of the entire system, and which components are the most vulnerable in the entire system? These questions are still unanswered today. To develop a reliability design for a BEV powertrain system, it is essential to conduct detailed research by investigating the most vulnerable component parts of the entire powertrain. In the present study, a fault-tree model of the entire powertrain and its subsystems was developed. Based on this model, the failure rates of all components were calculated first. Then, trends in the reliability indices for the entire powertrain and its components were estimated against BEV service life. From the estimation results, we learned that with increased service time, the reliability of the entire powertrain system is indeed much lower than that of its individual subsystems. Moreover, through comparative research, we found that the battery module is the most unreliable component not only of the battery system, but the entire powertrain system. Additionally, it was interesting to find that the reliability of the motor components was higher than that of other subsystem components, but that the reliability indices for the entire motor were not the highest among all the powertrain subsystems studied in this paper. We believe the findings of the present study will be of great significance to an improved understanding of the reliability design and maintenance of BEVs.},

ABSTRACT = {Radiation-based instruments have been widely used in petrochemical and oil industries to monitor liquid products transported through the same pipeline. Different radioactive gamma-ray emitter sources are typically used as radiation generators in the instruments mentioned above. The idea at the basis of this research is to investigate the use of an X-ray tube rather than a radioisotope source as an X-ray generator: This choice brings some advantages that will be discussed. The study is performed through a Monte Carlo simulation and artificial intelligence. Here, the system is composed of an X-ray tube, a pipe including fluid, and a NaI detector. Two-by-two mixtures of four various oil products with different volume ratios were considered to model the pipe’s interface region. For each combination, the X-ray spectrum was recorded in the detector in all the simulations. The recorded spectra were used for training and testing the multilayer perceptron (MLP) models. After training, MLP neural networks could estimate each oil product’s volume ratio with a mean absolute error of 2.72 which is slightly even better than what was obtained in former studies using radioisotope sources.},

ABSTRACT = {Biomass pellet fuel is one of the development directions of renewable energy. The purpose of the article is to study the combustion characteristics of five kinds of biomass pellet fuel that can be used as biomass fuel and analyze their combustion kinetics. The thermogravimetric method (TG method) was used to analyze the combustion characteristics of five kinds of biomass pellet fuel and to calculate the index S of comprehensive combustion characteristic. The Arrhenius equation and the Coats–Redfern method were used to analyze the combustion kinetics of five kinds of biomass pellet fuel. The activation energy and pre-exponential factor were obtained according to different temperature ranges. Conclusions are as follows: The pyrolysis of five kinds of biomass pellet fuel mainly includes three stages: (1) water evaporation stage, (2) volatile component combustion stage, (3) fixed carbon oxidation stage. The TG curves of five kinds of biomass pellet fuel are roughly the same at the same heating rate. The peaks of thermal weight loss rate and maximum degradation rate are both in the high temperature range. The differential thermal gravity (DTG) curves of five kinds of biomass pellet fuel have an obvious peak. The peak temperature of the largest peak in the DTG curves is 280–310 °C. The first-order reaction equation is used to obtain the kinetic parameters in stages. The correlation coefficients are bigger than the value of 0.92. The fitting results are in good agreement with the experimental results. The activation energy of each sample is basically the same in each stage. The value in the volatile matter combustion stage is 56–542 kJ/mol, and the activation energy of the carbon layer slowly increases rapidly. The five kinds of biomass pellet fuels have good combustion characteristics and kinetic characteristics, and they can be promoted and applied as biomass pellet fuels in the future.},

ABSTRACT = {In the past few decades, water and air were commonly used as working fluid to evaluate shell and tube heat exchanger (STHE) performance. This study was undertaken to estimate heat transfer coefficients and evaluate performance in the pilot-scale twisted tube-based STHE using the flue gas from biomass co-combustion as working fluid. Theoretical calculation along with experimental results were used to calculate the specific heat of flue gas. A simplified model was then developed from the integration of two heat transfer methods to predict the overall heat transfer coefficient without tedious calculation of individual heat transfer coefficients and fouling factors. Performance including water and trailer temperature, heat load, effectiveness, and overall heat transfer coefficient were jointly investigated under variable operating conditions. Results indicated that the specific heat of flue gas from co-combustion ranging between 1.044 and 1.338 kJ/kg·K while specific heat was increased by increasing flue gas temperature and decreasing excess air ratio. The developed mathematical model was validated to have relatively small errors to predict the overall heat transfer coefficient. A flue gas mass flow rate of 61.3–98.8 kg/h, a water flow rate of 13.7–14.1 L/min, and a parallel arrangement of two water-to-air heaters in an empty trailer were found to be optimal conditions for space heating purpose. In addition, a lower poultry litter feeding rate decreased heat loss of flue gas and increased heat gain of water, while a lower water flow rate also provided a lower maximum possible heat transfer rate with a higher actual heat transfer rate to quickly achieve heat equilibrium that ultimately improves the performance. This study demonstrates the possibility of collecting residual heat from the flue gas using the pilot-scale STHE system while outlining a systematic approach and process for evaluating its performance.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, a four-stroke engine diesel was employed to investigate the effects of different fuel mixture ratios of diesel and ethanol on engine performance and emission characteristics in terms of cylinder temperature, heat release rate, brake power, brake thermal efficiency, brake specific fuel consumption, and cylinder pressure. The corresponding simulation model of diesel engine was developed by AVL-Fire coupled CHEMKIN code, and an improved chemical kinetics mechanism containing 34 reactions and 19 species was employed to simulate the fuel spray process and combustion process. The simulation model was validated by experimental results under 100% and 50% load conditions and used to simulate the combustion process of diesel engine fueled with pure diesel and diesel–ethanol blends with 10%, 20%, and 30% ethanol by volume, respectively. The results showed that the increase of ethanol content in the blended fuel had a certain negative impact on the performance characteristic of diesel engine and significantly improved the emission characteristic of the engine. With the ethanol proportion in the blended fuel increased to 10%, 20%, and 30%, the brake thermal efficiency of the engine increased by 2.24%, 4.33%, and 6.37% respectively. However, the brake-specific fuel consumption increased by 1.56%, 3.49%, and 5.74% and the power decreased by 1.58%, 3.46%, and 5.54% respectively. In addition, with the ethanol proportion in the blended fuel increased to 10%, 20%, and 30%, the carbon monoxide emission decreased by 34.69%, 47.60%, and 56.58%, and the soot emission decreased by 7.83%, 15.24%, and 22.52% respectively. Finally, based on the combining fuzzy and grey correlation theory, nitrogen oxide emission has the highest correlation with engine power and brake-specific fuel consumption. The values reach 0.9103 and 0.8945 respectively. It shows that nitrogen oxide emission and cylinder pressure have a significant relationship on engine power and brake-specific fuel consumption.},

ABSTRACT = {The global focus on the use of renewable energy resources was mainly reignited by the signing of the Kyoto Protocol Agreement in 1997. Since then, the world has seen a great deal of progress in terms of the production and consumption of renewable energy. This in turn is rapidly powering economic growth and social development around the globe. Contrary to popular belief, the use of renewable energy is not limited to developed countries only. The developing countries are also rapidly endorsing renewable energy as a vital engine of economic growth and societal development. In this regard, even though renewable energy production and consumption are in their infancy in BRICS, these countries are taking concrete steps towards the development of renewable energy resources. The results of previous studies have indicated that with an increase in the GDP of a country its carbon footprint also tends to increase; the Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa (BRICS) countries are no exception in this regard. One of the main challenges in research related to measuring the contribution of renewable energy towards economic growth is the use of a singular model or techniques that may not be appropriate for the generalization of the results. This study intends to overcome this challenge by application of multiple econometric-based models which include the “Cross Dependency” test, the unit root test, and “CIPS” (cross-sectional augmented IPS). Besides these the second generation, stochastic models based upon econometrics, such as the DOLS test (dynamic ordinary least square) and the FMOLS (fully modified ordinary least square) are also applied for verification of the contribution of renewable energy towards the economic growth of the BRICS countries. The novelty of the study mainly stems from fact that these models are seldom applied in tandem and especially in the BRICS countries. The results of the study indicate that the existence of the bi-directional relationship between the use of renewable energy and economic growth is mainly indicated by the increase in GDP, thus lending support to the feedback hypothesis. Moreover, the conservation hypothesis was proven by the existence of a unidirectional causality relationship between the use of renewable energy and CO2 emissions. Alongside these, the study also included sensitivity analysis to gauge the impact of the growth of GDP on the CO2 emissions of BRICS countries, and regression analysis was performed to create an EKC curve which was used to gauge not only the sensitivity but also to help in highlighting the impact of using renewable energy in controlling and reducing CO2 emissions, thus proving the EKC theory. Thus, it can be deduced that increase in CO2 emissions is of major concern for the BRICS countries, which has led them to increase the production of renewable energy. Based upon the findings of the present study it is recommended that policymakers should encourage the use of renewable energy by offering incentives in financial terms, such as interest-free or low-interest loans, subsidies and feed-in tariffs.},

ABSTRACT = {One of the influential models in the artificial neural network (ANN) research field for addressing the issue of knowledge in the non-systematic logical rule is Random k Satisfiability. In this context, knowledge structure representation is also the potential application of Random k Satisfiability. Despite many attempts to represent logical rules in a non-systematic structure, previous studies have failed to consider higher-order logical rules. As the amount of information in the logical rule increases, the proposed network is unable to proceed to the retrieval phase, where the behavior of the Random Satisfiability can be observed. This study approaches these issues by proposing higher-order Random k Satisfiability for k ≤ 3 in the Hopfield Neural Network (HNN). In this regard, introducing the 3 Satisfiability logical rule to the existing network increases the synaptic weight dimensions in Lyapunov’s energy function and local field. In this study, we proposed an Election Algorithm (EA) to optimize the learning phase of HNN to compensate for the high computational complexity during the learning phase. This research extensively evaluates the proposed model using various performance metrics. The main findings of this research indicated the compatibility and performance of Random 3 Satisfiability logical representation during the learning and retrieval phase via EA with HNN in terms of error evaluations, energy analysis, similarity indices, and variability measures. The results also emphasized that the proposed Random 3 Satisfiability representation incorporates with EA in HNN is capable to optimize the learning and retrieval phase as compared to the conventional model, which deployed Exhaustive Search (ES).},

ABSTRACT = {Air pollution, especially in large cities around the world, is associated with serious problems both with people’s health and the environment. Over the past few years, there has been a particularly intensive demand for alternatives to fossil fuels, because when they are burned, substances that pollute the environment are released. In addition to the smoke from fuels burned for heating and harmful emissions that industrial installations release, the exhaust emissions of vehicles create a large share of the fossil fuel pollution. Alternative fuels, known as non-conventional and advanced fuels, are derived from resources other than fossil fuels. Because alcoholic fuels have several physical and propellant properties similar to those of gasoline, they can be considered as one of the alternative fuels. Alcoholic fuels or alcohol-blended fuels may be used in gasoline engines to reduce exhaust emissions. This study aimed to develop a gasoline engine model to predict the influence of different types of alcohol-blended fuels on performance and emissions. For the purpose of this study, the AVL Boost software was used to analyse characteristics of the gasoline engine when operating with different mixtures of ethanol, methanol, butanol, and gasoline (by volume). Results obtained from different fuel blends showed that when alcohol blends were used, brake power decreased and the brake specific fuel consumption increased compared to when using gasoline, and CO and HC concentrations decreased as the fuel blends percentage increased.},

ABSTRACT = {This study investigates the techno-economic feasibility of an off-grid integrated solar/wind/hydrokinetic plant to co-generate electricity and hydrogen for a remote micro-community. In addition to the techno-economic viability assessment of the proposed system via HOMER (hybrid optimization of multiple energy resources), a sensitivity analysis is conducted to ascertain the impact of ±10% fluctuations in wind speed, solar radiation, temperature, and water velocity on annual electric production, unmet electricity load, LCOE (levelized cost of electricity), and NPC (net present cost). For this, a far-off village with 15 households is selected as the case study. The results reveal that the NPC, LCOE, and LCOH (levelized cost of hydrogen) of the system are equal to $333,074, 0.1155 $/kWh, and 4.59 $/kg, respectively. Technical analysis indicates that the PV system with the rated capacity of 40 kW accounts for 43.7% of total electricity generation. This portion for the wind turbine and the hydrokinetic turbine with nominal capacities of 10 kW and 20 kW equates to 23.6% and 32.6%, respectively. Finally, the results of sensitivity assessment show that among the four variables only a +10% fluctuation in water velocity causes a 20% decline in NPC and LCOE.},

ABSTRACT = {In order to improve the estimation accuracy of the state of charge (SOC) of electric vehicle power batteries, a dual Kalman filter method based on the online identification of model parameters is proposed to estimate the state of charge in lithium-ion batteries. Here, we build the first-order equivalent circuit model of lithium-ion batteries and derive its online identification model based on extended Kalman (EKF). Considering that the noise value in the EKF algorithm is difficult to select through experiments to achieve the best filtering effect, this paper combines an improved particle swarm optimization algorithm (IPSO) with EKF to realize online model parameter identification. At the same time, the EKF filtering method derived from the state space equation is also used in SOC estimation. It constitutes a dual Kalman filter method for online identification of model parameters and SOC estimation. The experimental and simulation results show that the IPSO–EKF algorithm can adaptively adjust the noise value according to the complex operating conditions of electric vehicles. Compared with the EKF algorithm, our algorithm can identify battery model parameters more accurately. The dual Kalman filter method composed of the IPSO–EKF algorithm and EKF applied to SOC estimation achieved a higher accuracy in the final algorithm verification.},

ABSTRACT = {The global population is moving away from fossil fuel technologies due to their many disadvantages, such as air pollution, greenhouse gases emission, global warming, acid rain, health problems, and high costs. These disadvantages make fossil fuels unsustainable. As a result, renewable energy is becoming more attractive due to its steadily decreasing costs. Harnessing renewable energy promises to meet the present energy demands of the African continent. The enormous renewable energy potential available across the African continent remains largely untapped, especially for wind energy. However, marginal and fair wind speeds and power densities characterize African wind energy resulting in low and unsustainable power in many areas. This research develops a techno-economic model for wind energy cost analysis for a novel, Ferris wheel-based wind turbine. The model is used to techno-economically analyze the siting of wind turbine sites in low wind speed areas on the African continent. The wind turbine’s technical performance is characterized by calculating the annual energy production and the capacity factor using the wind Weibull probability distribution of the cities and theoretical power curve of the wind turbine. Its economic performance is evaluated using annualized financial return on investment, simple payback period, and levelized cost of electricity. The techno-economic model is validated for 21 African cities and shows that the Ferris wheel-based design is very competitive with four current, commercial wind turbines, as well as with other sources of energy. Hence, the new wind turbine may help provide the economical, clean, renewable energy that Africa needs.},

ABSTRACT = {One of the many barriers to decarbonization and decentralization of the energy sector in developing countries is the economic uncertainty. As such, this study scrutinizes economics of three grid-independent hybrid renewable-based systems proposed to co-generate electricity and heat for a small-scale load. Accordingly, the under-study systems are simulated and optimized with the aid of HOMER Pro software. Here, a 20-year average value of discount and inflation rates is deemed a benchmark case. The techno-economic-environmental and reliability results suggest a standalone solar/wind/electrolyzer/hydrogen-based fuel cell integrated with a hydrogen-based boiler system is the best alternative. Moreover, to ascertain the impact of economic uncertainty on optimal unit sizing of the nominated model, the fluctuations of the nominal discount rate and inflation, respectively, constitute within the range of 15–20% and 10–26%. The findings of economic uncertainty analysis imply that total net present cost (TNPC) fluctuates around the benchmark value symmetrically between $478,704 and $814,905. Levelized energy cost varies from an amount 69% less than the benchmark value up to two-fold of that. Furthermore, photovoltaic (PV) optimal size starts from a value 23% less than the benchmark case and rises up to 55% more. The corresponding figures for wind turbine (WT) are, respectively, 21% and 29%. Eventually, several practical policies are introduced to cope with economic uncertainty.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, biodiesel was used as an alternative fuel to investigate the combustion and emission characteristics of a four-stroke diesel engine, in terms of cylinder pressure, heat release rate, cylinder temperature, brake thermal efficiency, brake specific fuel consumption, nitrogen oxide, soot, carbon monoxide, and hydrocarbon. Firstly, a diesel engine cylinder model was developed by AVL-Fire software coupled with CHEMKIN code to simulate the injection and combustion of biodiesel with a kinetic mechanism with 106 species and 263 reactions. Then, the simulation model was validated by experimental results under 100% and 50% load conditions and used to simulate the combustion process of a diesel engine fueled with pure diesel, biodiesel, and biodiesel–diesel blends with 10%, 20%, 30% biodiesel by volume, respectively. The results showed that the brake specific fuel consumption increased with the increase of mixed biodiesel ratio. The brake specific fuel consumptions of B10, B20 and B30 increased by 1.1%, 2.3% and 3.3%, respectively, compared with that of D100. The combustion and emission characteristics of the diesel engine are improved. Therefore, biodiesel can be used as an alternative fuel for the diesel engine. The diesel–biodiesel fuel can improve the combustion and emission characteristics of the diesel engine.},

ABSTRACT = {This work explores the technical possibilities of increasing the efficiency of a standard solar chimney power plant (SCPP) by integrating it with photovoltaic (PV) panels. The integration is possible by using the collector circumference to install the PV collectors, which provide a heat sink, allow for the better harvesting of the solar radiation, and increase energy production. The new design led to an increase in the annual electricity production from 380 to 494 MWh and water production from 278 to 326 k tons/year compared with the standard SCPP, marking an increase of 30% and 17%, respectively. The results also show that the integration reduced the greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), the localized cost of energy, and the capital cost of investment by 30%, 36%, and 20%, respectively. The proposed design supports the sustainable replacement of the existing desalination plants with zero operational costs and an excellent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.},

ABSTRACT = {The optimization of lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery pack usage has become essential due to the increasing demand for Li-ion batteries. Since degradation in Li-ion batteries is inevitable, there has been some effort recently on research to maximize the utilization of Li-ion battery cells in the pack. Some promising concepts include reconfigurable battery packs and cell replacement to limit the negative impact of early-degraded cells on the entire pack. This paper used a simulation framework, based on a cell voltage model and a degradation model, to study the feasibility and benefits of the cell replacement concept. The simulation conducted in MATLAB involves generating and varying Li-ion cells in the packs stochastically and simulating the life of the cells as well as the packs until they reach their end-of-life stage. It was found that the cell replacement method can increase the total number of cycles of the battery packs, effectively prolonging the lifespan of the packs. It is also determined that this approach can be more economically beneficial than the current approach of simple pack replacement. For the cell replacement concept to be practical, two main design criteria should be satisfied including individual cell monitoring and easy accessibility to cells at failure stage.},

ABSTRACT = {Wind energy has become one of the world’s most renewable energy sources in recent years. It is regarded as a clean energy source because it produces no greenhouse gas emissions. The assessment of wind energy resources is an important step in the development of any wind energy conversion system (WECS). As a result, this article examines the wind energy potential of nine Jordanian wind locations: Queen Alia Airport, Civil Amman Airport, King Hussein Airport, Irbid, Mafraq, Ma’an, Ghor Al Safi, Safawi, and Irwaished. The available wind speed data were implemented using three statistical distribution models, Weibull, Rayleigh, and Gamma distributions, and one traditional estimation method, the Maximum Likelihood Method (MLM). Three optimization techniques were used to assign parameters to each distribution model: Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO), and Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA). To determine the optimal distribution model, the performance of these distribution models was tested. According to the findings, King Hussein Airport features the highest wind power density, followed by Queen Alia Airport, while Irbid features the lowest, followed by Ghor Al Safi.},

ABSTRACT = {Methanol, as a promising carbon-neutral fuel, has become a research hotspot worldwide. In this study, pure gasoline and gasoline blended with five different volume ratios of methanol (10%, 20%, 30%, 50%, and 75%) were selected as test fuels, which were referred to as M0, M10, M20, M30, M50, and M75. The experiments on carbon and pollutant emissions and performance were carried out on a passenger vehicle with gasoline direct injection (GDI) turbocharged engine using the steady-state, new European driving cycle (NEDC), and acceleration approaches. The results show that under steady-state conditions, as the methanol blending ratio increases, the volume of fuel consumption increases. Compared with pure gasoline, the equivalent fuel consumption and the CO2 emissions are reduced by 0.95 L/100 km (10.6%) and 18.95 g/km (9.6%) in maximum extent by fueling M75, respectively. In the NEDC, the CO2 emissions of M30 are reduced by 5.46 g/km (3.7%) compared with pure gasoline. After blending methanol in gasoline, CO emissions increase, and the emissions of NOx, THC, and PM decrease. The acceleration time is shortened with the increase of blending ratio of methanol. The application of methanol reduces the combustion CO2 emissions by 10% and improves the pollutant emissions.},

ABSTRACT = {The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is making significant progress in improving its economy by attracting tourists and trade. In the short run, however, economic activity will continue to be more based on oil, natural gas, and related industries. Rising demand for natural gas for power plants and industrial users, such as petrochemicals and steelmakers, has made the UAE a net gas importer, prompting the country to launch multibillion-dollar investments in nuclear and renewable energy. This study addresses the trend of solar energy production and consumption in the UAE. The strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis was performed on the different types of solar energy in the UAE, and some strategies were developed based on it. The SWOT analysis reveals promising strategies for the UAE’s solar energy transition that would reduce fossil fuel demand, mitigate greenhouse gas emissions through solar energy production, and transform the UAE into the carbon market centre of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.},

ABSTRACT = {High current rate charging causes inevitable severe heat generation, thermal inconsistency, and even thermal runaway of lithium-ion batteries. Concerning this, a liquid cooling plate comprising a multi-stage Tesla valve (MSTV) configuration with high recognition in microfluidic applications was proposed to provide a safer temperature range for a prismatic-type lithium-ion battery. Meanwhile, a surrogate model with the objectives of the cooling performance and energy cost was constructed, and the impact of some influential design parameters was explored through the robustness analysis of the model. On this basis, the multi-objective optimization design of the neighborhood cultivation genetic algorithm (NCGA) was carried out. The obtained results demonstrated that if the MSTV channel was four channels, the valve-to-valve distance was 14.79 mm, and the thickness was 0.94 mm, the cold plate had the most effective cooling performance and a lower pumping power consumption. Finally, the optimization results were verified by a numerical simulation and an experiment, and the performance evaluation was compared with the traditional serpentine channel. The results reported that the optimized design reduced the maximum temperature and standard surface standard deviation of the cold plate by 26% and 35%, respectively. The additional pump power consumption was 17.3%. This research guides the design of battery thermal management systems to improve efficiency and energy costs, especially under the high current rate charging conditions of lithium-ion batteries.},
