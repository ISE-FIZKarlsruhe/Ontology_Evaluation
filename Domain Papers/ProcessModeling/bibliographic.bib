ABSTRACT = {(TiZrHf)NiSn half-Heusler compounds were prepared by arc melting and their thermoelectric properties characterized in the temperature range between 325 K and 857 K, resulting in a Figure of Merit ZT ≈ 0.45. Furthermore, the prepared samples were used to construct a unileg module. This module was characterized in a homemade thermoelectric module measurement stand and yielded 275 mW/cm2 and a maximum volumetric power density of 700 mW/cm3. This was reached using normal silver paint as a contacting material; from an improved contacting, much higher power yields are to be expected.},

ABSTRACT = {This research explains the melt spinning of bicomponent fibers, consisting of a conductive polypropylene (PP) core and a piezoelectric sheath (polyvinylidene fluoride). Previously analyzed piezoelectric capabilities of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) are to be exploited in sensor filaments. The PP compound contains a 10 wt % carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and 2 wt % sodium stearate (NaSt). The sodium stearate is added to lower the viscosity of the melt. The compound constitutes the fiber core that is conductive due to a percolation CNT network. The PVDF sheath’s piezoelectric effect is based on the formation of an all-trans conformation β phase, caused by draw-winding of the fibers. The core and sheath materials, as well as the bicomponent fibers, are characterized through different analytical methods. These include wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) to analyze crucial parameters for the development of a crystalline β phase. The distribution of CNTs in the polymer matrix, which affects the conductivity of the core, was investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Thermal characterization is carried out by conventional differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Optical microscopy is used to determine the fibers’ diameter regularity (core and sheath). The materials’ viscosity is determined by rheometry. Eventually, an LCR tester is used to determine the core’s specific resistance.},

ABSTRACT = {Triple-shape memory epoxy (EP)/polycaprolactone (PCL) systems (PCL content: 23 wt %) with different structures (PCL nanoweb embedded in EP matrix and EP/PCL with co-continuous phase structure) were produced. To set the two temporary shapes, the glass transition temperature (Tg) of the EP and the melting temperature (Tm) of PCL served during the shape memory cycle. An attempt was made to reinforce the PCL nanoweb by graphene nanoplatelets prior to infiltrating the nanoweb with EP through vacuum assisted resin transfer molding. Morphology was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy and Raman spectrometry. Triple-shape memory characteristics were determined by dynamic mechanical analysis in tension mode. Graphene was supposed to act also as spacer between the nanofibers, improving the quality of impregnation with EP. The EP phase related shape memory properties were similar for all systems, while those belonging to PCL phase depended on the structure. Shape fixity of PCL was better without than with graphene reinforcement. The best shape memory performance was shown by the EP/PCL with co-continuous structure. Based on Raman spectrometry results, the characteristic dimension of the related co-continuous network was below 900 nm.},

ABSTRACT = {A new meta-surface structure (MSS) with a near-zero refractive index (NZRI) is proposed to enhance the performance of a square loop antenna array. The main challenge to improve the antenna performance is increment of the overall antenna volume that is mitigated by assimilating the planar NZRI MSS at the back of the antenna structure. The proposed NZRI MSS-loaded CPW-fed (Co-Planar Waveguide) four-element array antenna is designed on ceramic-bioplastic-ceramic sandwich substrate using high-frequency structure simulator (HFSS), a finite-element-method-based simulation tool. The gain and directivity of the antenna are significantly enhanced by incorporating the NZRI MSS with a 7 × 6 set of elements at the back of the antenna structure. Measurement results show that the maximum gains of the antenna increased from 6.21 dBi to 8.25 dBi, from 6.52 dBi to 9.05 dBi and from 10.54 dBi to 12.15 dBi in the first, second and third bands, respectively. The effect of the slot configuration in the ground plane on the reflection coefficient of the antenna was analyzed and optimized. The overall performance makes the proposed antenna appropriate for UHFFM (Ultra High Frequency Frequency Modulation) telemetry-based space applications as well as mobile satellite, microwave radiometry and radio astronomy applications.},

ABSTRACT = {Friction Stir Welding (FSW) is a solid-state joining process; i.e., no melting occurs. The welding process is promoted by the rotation and translation of an axis-symmetric non-consumable tool along the weld centerline. Thus, the FSW process is performed at much lower temperatures than conventional fusion welding, nevertheless it has some disadvantages. Laser Assisted Friction Stir Welding (LAFSW) is a combination in which the FSW is the dominant welding process and the laser pre-heats the weld. In this work FSW and LAFSW tests were conducted on 6 mm thick 5754H111 aluminum alloy plates in butt joint configuration. LAFSW is studied firstly to demonstrate the weldability of aluminum alloy using that technique. Secondly, process parameters, such as laser power and temperature gradient are investigated in order to evaluate changes in microstructure, micro-hardness, residual stress, and tensile properties. Once the possibility to achieve sound weld using LAFSW is demonstrated, it will be possible to explore the benefits for tool wear, higher welding speeds, and lower clamping force.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper the effects of the strain rate on the inelastic behavior and the self-heating under load conditions are presented for polymeric materials, such as polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), polycarbonate (PC), and polyamide (PA66). By a torsion test, it was established that the shear yield stress behavior of PMMA, PC, and PA66 is well-described by the Ree-Eyring theory in the range of the considered strain rates. During the investigation, the surface temperature was monitored using an infrared camera. The heat release appeared at the early stage of the deformation and increased with the strain and strain rate. This suggested that the external work of deformation was dissipated into heat so the torsion tests could not be considered isothermal. Eventually, the effect of the strain rate on the failure modes was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy.},

ABSTRACT = {The role of iron in two modes of integration into alumina catalysts was studied at 0.39 wt% Fe and tested in trichloroethylene combustion. One modified alumina was synthesized using the sol-gel method with Fe added in situ during hydrolysis; another modification was performed using calcined alumina, prepared using the sol-gel method and impregnated with Fe. Several characterization techniques were used to study the level of Fe modification in the γ-Al2O3 phase formed and to correlate the catalytic properties during trichloroethylene (TCE) combustion. The introduction of Fe in situ during the sol-gel process influenced the crystallite size, and three iron species were generated, namely, magnetite, maghemite and hematite. The impregnated Fe-alumina formed hematite and maghemite, which were highly dispersed on the γ-Al2O3 surface. The X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS), FT-IR and Mössbauer spectroscopy analyses revealed how Fe interacted with the γ-Al2O3 lattice in both catalysts. The impregnated Fe-catalyst showed the best catalytic performance compared to the catalyst that was Fe-doped in situ by the sol-gel method; both had better catalytic activity than pure alumina. This difference in activity was correlated with the accessibility of the reactants to the hematite iron species on the surface. The chlorine poisoning for all three catalysts was less than 1.8%.},

ABSTRACT = {The paper presents results of validation of the anhysteretic magnetization model for a soft amorphous alloy with significant perpendicular anisotropy. The validation was carried out for the Jiles-Atherton model with Ramesh extension considering anisotropy. Due to the fact that it is difficult to measure anhysteretic magnetization directly, the soft magnetic core with negligible hysteresis was used. The results of validation indicate that the Jiles-Atherton model with Ramesh extension should be corrected to allow accurate modeling of the anhysteretic magnetization. The corrected model may be applied for modeling the cores of current transformers operating in a wide range of measured currents.},

ABSTRACT = {Polystyrene-reduced graphene oxide (PSTY/RGO) composites were prepared via the in situ bulk polymerization method using two different preparation techniques. The general approach is to use microwave irradiation (MWI) to enhance the exfoliation and the dispersion of RGO nanosheets within the PSTY matrix. In the first approach, a mixture of GO and styrene monomers (STY) were polymerized using a bulk polymerization method facilitated by microwave irradiation (MWI) to obtain R-(GO-PSTY) composites. In the second approach, a mixture of RGO and STY monomers were polymerized using a bulk polymerization method to obtain RGO-(PSTY) composites. The two composites were characterized by FTIR, 1H-NMR, XRD, SEM, HRTEM, TGA and DSC. The results indicate that the composite obtained using the first approach, which involved MWI, had a better morphology and dispersion with enhanced thermal stability, compared with the composites prepared without MWI. Moreover, DSC results showed that the Tg value of the composites after loading the RGO significantly increased by 24.6 °C compared to the neat polystyrene.},

ABSTRACT = {Bituminous materials are playing a vital role in pavement design and the roofing industry because of outstanding properties. Unfortunately, bituminous materials will release volatile organic compounds (VOC), making them non-environmentally friendly. Therefore, technologies that can be used to decrease the VOC emission are urgently required. In this research, the VOC emission and material behaviors were analyzed and compared to investigate the possibility of adding styrene butadiene styrene (SBS) and active carbon filler into bituminous materials to develop environmentally-friendly materials. Thermal gravimetric analysis-mass spectrometry (TG-MS) and ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy testing (UV-Vis) were employed to characterize the VOC emission process. Temperature sweep testing and frequency sweep testing were conducted to evaluate the rheological properties of bituminous materials. Research results indicated that the combined introduction of 4 wt% styrene butadiene styrene (SBS) and 4 wt% active carbon filler cannot only significantly lower the VOC emission speed and amount, but also improve the deformation resistance behavior at a higher temperature. SBS and active carbon filler can be used to reduce the VOC emission form bituminous materials.},

ABSTRACT = {The interest of microelectronics industry in new organic compounds for the manufacture of luminescent devices has increased substantially in the last decade. In this paper, we carried out a study of the usage feasibility of three organic bidentate ligands (2,6-dihydroxyanthraquinone, anthraflavic acid and potassium derivative salt of anthraflavic acid) for the synthesis of an organic semiconductor based in silicon phthalocyanines (SiPcs). We report the visible photoluminescence (PL) at room temperature obtained from thermal-evaporated thin films of these new materials. The surface morphology of these films was analyzed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). AFM indicated that the thermal evaporation technique is an excellent resource in order to obtain low thin film roughness when depositing these kinds of compounds. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectroscopy was employed to investigate possible changes in the intra-molecular bonds and to identify any evidence of crystallinity in the powder compounds and in the thin films after their deposition. FTIR showed that there was not any important change in the samples after the thermal deposition. The absorption coefficient (α) in the absorption region reveals non-direct transitions. Furthermore, the PL of all the investigated samples were observed with the naked eye in a bright background and also measured by a spectrofluorometer. The normalized PL spectra showed a Stokes shift ≈ 0.6 eV in two of our three samples, and no PL emission in the last one. Those results indicate that the Vis PL comes from a recombination of charge carriers between conduction band and valence band preceded by a non-radiative relaxation in the conduction band tails.},

The upconversion luminescence spectra of NaYF4 nanoparticles with different dopants under 808-nm excitation proves that the Nd3+ ion can absorb the photons effectively, and the Yb3+ ion can play the role of an energy-transfer bridging ion between the Nd3+ ion and Er3+ ion. To investigate the effect of the Nd3+ ion, the decay curves of the 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 transition at 540 nm are measured and analyzed. The NaYF4: 20% Yb3+, 2% Er3+, 0.5% Nd3+ nanocrystals have the highest emission intensity among all samples under 808-nm excitation. The UC (upconversion) mechanism under 808-nm excitation is discussed in terms of the experimental results.},

It was found that the bath temperature used in the reaction can influence the reaction rates, i.e., the times needed for the shape transformation process were 5, 11.5, 25, 45, 72, and 100 h at 60, 40, 20, 10, 5, and 0 °C, respectively. In addition, the bath temperature can also alter the morphologies of the final products. The major products are silver nanoplates at 60, 40 and 20 °C. However, they became decahedral silver NPs at 5 and 0 °C. The percentages of decahedral silver NPs synthesized at 60, 40, 20, 10, 5, and 0 °C are 0%, 1%, 5%, 45%, 73%, and 89%, respectively. Measuring the surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) spectra of the probe molecule R6G in the presence of KBr showed that both silver nanoplate colloids synthesized at 60 °C and decahedral silver NP colloids synthesized at 0 °C in the absence of PVP had good SERS activities.},

ABSTRACT = {A new design and analysis of a wide-band double-negative metamaterial, considering a frequency range of 0.5 to 7 GHz, is presented in this paper. Four different unit cells with varying design parameters are analyzed to evaluate the effects of the unit-cell size on the resonance frequencies of the metamaterial. Moreover, open and interconnected 2 × 2 array structures of unit cells are analyzed. The finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method, based on the Computer Simulation Technology (CST) Microwave Studio, is utilized in the majority of this investigation. The experimental portion of the study was performed in a semi-anechoic chamber. Good agreement is observed between the simulated and measured S parameters of the developed unit cell and array. The designed unit cell exhibits negative permittivity and permeability simultaneously at S-band (2.95 GHz to 4.00 GHz) microwave frequencies. In addition, the designed unit cell can also operate as a double-negative medium throughout the C band (4.00 GHz to 4.95 GHz and 5.00 GHz to 5.57 GHz). At a number of other frequencies, it exhibits a single negative value. The two array configurations cause a slight shift in the resonance frequencies of the metamaterial and hence lead to a slight shift of the single- and double-negative frequency ranges of the metamaterial.},

ABSTRACT = {Lignin-based polyols were synthesized through microwave-assisted liquefaction under different microwave heating times (5–30 min). The liquefaction reactions were carried out using polyethylene glycol (PEG-400)/glycerol as liquefying solvents and 97 wt% sulfur acid as a catalyst at 140 °C. The polyols obtained were analyzed for their yield, composition and structural characteristics using gel permeation chromatography (GPC), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra. FT-IR and NMR spectra showed that the liquefying solvents reacted with the phenol hydroxyl groups of the lignin in the liquefied product. With increasing microwave heating time, the viscosity of polyols was slightly increased and their corresponding molecular weight (MW) was gradually reduced. The optimal condition at the microwave heating time (5 min) ensured a high liquefaction yield (97.47%) and polyol with a suitable hydroxyl number (8.628 mmol/g). Polyurethane (PU) foams were prepared by polyols and methylene diphenylene diisocyanate (MDI) using the one-shot method. With the isocyanate/hydroxyl group ([NCO]/[OH]) ratio increasing from 0.6 to 1.0, their mechanical properties were gradually increased. This study provided some insight into the microwave-assisted liquefied lignin polyols for the production of rigid PU foam.},

ABSTRACT = {Palm oil fuel ash (POFA) has previously been used as a partial cement replacement in concrete. However, limited research has been undertaken to utilize POFA in high volume in concrete. This paper presents a study on the treatment and utilization of POFA in high volume of up to 50% by weight of cement in self-consolidating high strength concrete (SCHSC). POFA was treated via heat treatment to reduce the content of unburned carbon. Ordinary Portland cement was substituted with 0%, 10%, 20%, 30%, and 50% treated POFA in SCHSC. Tests have been conducted on the fresh properties, such as filling ability, passing ability and segregation resistance, as well as compressive strength, drying shrinkage and acid attack resistance to check the effect of high volume treated POFA on SCHSC. The results revealed that compared to the control concrete mix, the fresh properties, compressive strength, drying shrinkage, and resistance against acid attack have been significantly improved. Conclusively, treated POFA can be used in high volume as a cement replacement to produce SCHSC with an improvement in its properties.},

ABSTRACT = {Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) are an ultravioletlight (UV)-resistant material. In this study, two types of LDHs (Mg-Al-LDHs and Zn-Al-LDHs) were applied to modify bitumen by melt-blending. The effect of ultraviolet aging on the rheology and chemistry of LDH-modified bitumen was studied by means of dynamic shear rheometer (DSR), thin-layer chromatography with flame ionization detection (TLC-FID), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and Ultraviolet-Visible (UV-Vis) spectrophotometry to reveal the mechanisms of action for LDHs and bitumen. The results showed that within the UV spectra (220–400 nm), the reflectance of Zn-Al-LDHs was larger than that of Mg-Al-LDHs. These two LDHs have different influences on the performance of bitumen. Mg-Al-LDHs had a more obvious influence on the physical and dynamic rheological properties of bitumen than Zn-Al-LDHs. Zn-Al-LDHs improved the UV-aging resistance of bitumen more. The reason can be that the reflectance of the Zn-Al-LDHs to the UV light is larger than that of the Mg-Al-LDHs. The Zn-Al-LDH-modified bitumen had more potential to improve the UV-aging resistance during the service life of asphalt pavement.},

ABSTRACT = {Eu-doped ternary sulfides of general formula ALnS2 (A = Na, K, Rb; Ln = La, Gd, Lu, Y) are presented as a novel interesting material family which may find usage as X-ray phosphors or solid state white light emitting diode (LED) lighting. Samples were synthesized in the form of transparent crystalline hexagonal platelets by chemical reaction under the flow of hydrogen sulfide. Their physical properties were investigated by means of X-ray diffraction, time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy, electron paramagnetic resonance, and X-ray excited fluorescence. Corresponding characteristics, including absorption, radioluminescence, photoluminescence excitation and emission spectra, and decay kinetics curves, were measured and evaluated in a broad temperature range (8–800 K). Calculations including quantum local crystal field potential and spin-Hamiltonian for a paramagnetic particle in D3d local symmetry and phenomenological model dealing with excited state dynamics were performed to explain the experimentally observed features. Based on the results, an energy diagram of lanthanide energy levels in KLuS2 is proposed. Color model xy-coordinates are used to compare effects of dopants on the resulting spectrum. The application potential of the mentioned compounds in the field of white LED solid state lighting or X-ray phosphors is thoroughly discussed.},

ABSTRACT = {In concrete repair systems, material properties of the repair material and the interface are greatly influenced by the moisture exchange between the repair material and the substrate. If the substrate is dry, it can absorb water from the repair material and reduce its effective water-to-cement ratio (w/c). This further affects the hydration rate of cement based material. In addition to the change in hydration rate, void content at the interface between the two materials is also affected. In this research, the influence of moisture exchange on the void content in the repair system as a function of initial saturation level of the substrate is investigated. Repair systems with varying level of substrate saturation are made. Moisture exchange in these repair systems as a function of time is monitored by the X-ray absorption technique. After a specified curing age (3 d), the internal microstructure of the repair systems was captured by micro-computed X-ray tomography (CT-scanning). From reconstructed images, different phases in the repair system (repair material, substrate, voids) can be distinguished. In order to quantify the void content, voids were thresholded and their percentage was calculated. It was found that significantly more voids form when the substrate is dry prior to application of the repair material. Air, initially filling voids and pores of the dry substrate, is being released due to the moisture exchange. As a result, air voids remain entrapped in the repair material close to the interface. These voids are found to form as a continuation of pre-existing surface voids in the substrate. Knowledge about moisture exchange and its effects provides engineers with the basis for recommendations about substrate preconditioning in practice.},

ABSTRACT = {Increasing urbanization and industrialization lead to the release of metals into the biosphere, which has become a serious issue for public health. In this paper, the direct electrochemical reduction of zinc ions is studied using electrochemically reduced graphene oxide (ERGO) modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE). The graphene oxide (GO) was fabricated using modified Hummers method and was electrochemically reduced on the surface of GCE by performing cyclic voltammograms from 0 to −1.5 V. The modification was optimized and properties of electrodes were determined using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and cyclic voltammetry (CV). The determination of Zn(II) was performed using differential pulse voltammetry technique, platinum wire as a counter electrode, and Ag/AgCl/3 M KCl reference electrode. Compared to the bare GCE the modified GCE/ERGO shows three times better electrocatalytic activity towards zinc ions, with an increase of reduction current along with a negative shift of reduction potential. Using GCE/ERGO detection limit 5 ng·mL−1 was obtained.},

ABSTRACT = {The opportunity for substantial efficiency enhancements of thin film hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) solar photovoltaic (PV) cells using plasmonic absorbers requires ultra-thin transparent conducting oxide top electrodes with low resistivity and high transmittances in the visible range of the electromagnetic spectrum. Fabricating ultra-thin indium tin oxide (ITO) films (sub-50 nm) using conventional methods has presented a number of challenges; however, a novel method involving chemical shaving of thicker (greater than 80 nm) RF sputter deposited high-quality ITO films has been demonstrated. This study investigates the effect of oxygen concentration on the etch rates of RF sputter deposited ITO films to provide a detailed understanding of the interaction of all critical experimental parameters to help create even thinner layers to allow for more finely tune plasmonic resonances. ITO films were deposited on silicon substrates with a 98-nm, thermally grown oxide using RF magnetron sputtering with oxygen concentrations of 0, 0.4 and 1.0 sccm and annealed at 300 °C air ambient. Then the films were etched using a combination of water and hydrochloric and nitric acids for 1, 3, 5 and 8 min at room temperature. In-between each etching process cycle, the films were characterized by X-ray diffraction, atomic force microscopy, Raman Spectroscopy, 4-point probe (electrical conductivity), and variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometry. All the films were polycrystalline in nature and highly oriented along the (222) reflection. Ultra-thin ITO films with record low resistivity values (as low as 5.83 × 10−4 Ω·cm) were obtained and high optical transparency is exhibited in the 300–1000 nm wavelength region for all the ITO films. The etch rate, preferred crystal lattice growth plane, d-spacing and lattice distortion were also observed to be highly dependent on the nature of growth environment for RF sputter deposited ITO films. The structural, electrical, and optical properties of the ITO films are discussed with respect to the oxygen ambient nature and etching time in detail to provide guidance for plasmonic enhanced a-Si:H solar PV cell fabrication.},

ABSTRACT = {p-BiOI nanosheets/n-TiO2 nanofibers (p-BiOI/n-TiO2 NFs) have been facilely prepared via the electrospinning technique combining successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR). Dense BiOI nanosheets with good crystalline and width about 500 nm were uniformly assembled on TiO2 nanofibers at room temperature. The amount of the heterojunctions and the specific surface area were well controlled by adjusting the SILAR cycles. Due to the synergistic effect of p-n heterojunctions and high specific surface area, the obtained p-BiOI/n-TiO2 NFs exhibited enhanced visible-light photocatalytic activity. Moreover, the p-BiOI/n-TiO2 NFs heterojunctions could be easily recycled without decreasing the photocatalytic activity owing to their one-dimensional nanofibrous structure. Based on the above, the heterojunctions of p-BiOI/n-TiO2 NFs may be promising visible-light-driven photocatalysts for converting solar energy to chemical energy in environment remediation.},

ABSTRACT = {The effect of the A-site cation ordering on the chemical stability, oxygen stoichiometry and electrical conductivity in layered LaBaCo2O5+δ double perovskite was studied as a function of temperature and partial pressure of oxygen. Tetragonal A-site cation ordered layered LaBaCo2O5+δ double perovskite was obtained by annealing cubic A-site cation disordered La0.5Ba0.5CoO3-δ perovskite at 1100 °C in N2. High temperature X-ray diffraction between room temperature (RT) and 800 °C revealed that LaBaCo2O5+δ remains tetragonal during heating in oxidizing atmosphere, but goes through two phase transitions in N2 and between 450 °C and 675 °C from tetragonal P4/mmm to orthorhombic Pmmm and back to P4/mmm due to oxygen vacancy ordering followed by disordering of the oxygen vacancies. An anisotropic chemical and thermal expansion of LaBaCo2O5+δ was demonstrated. La0.5Ba0.5CoO3-δ remained cubic at the studied temperature irrespective of partial pressure of oxygen. LaBaCo2O5+δ is metastable with respect to La0.5Ba0.5CoO3-δ at oxidizing conditions inferred from the thermal evolution of the oxygen deficiency and oxidation state of Co in the two materials. The oxidation state of Co is higher in La0.5Ba0.5CoO3-δ resulting in a higher electrical conductivity relative to LaBaCo2O5+δ. The conductivity in both materials was reduced with decreasing partial pressure of oxygen pointing to a p-type semiconducting behavior.},

ABSTRACT = {Internal stress in structural steel members is an important parameter for steel structures in their design, construction, and service stages. However, it is hard to measure via traditional approaches. Among the existing non-destructive testing (NDT) methods, the ultrasonic method has received the most research attention. Longitudinal critically refracted (Lcr) waves, which propagate parallel to the surface of the material within an effective depth, have shown great potential as an effective stress measurement approach. This paper presents a systematic non-destructive evaluation method to determine the internal stress in in-service structural steel members using Lcr waves. Based on theory of acoustoelasticity, a stress evaluation formula is derived. Factor of stress to acoustic time difference is used to describe the relationship between stress and measurable acoustic results. A testing facility is developed and used to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method. Two steel members are measured by using the proposed method and the traditional strain gauge method for verification. Parametric studies are performed on three steel members and the aluminum plate to investigate the factors that influence the testing results. The results show that the proposed method is effective and accurate for determining stress in in-service structural steel members.},

ABSTRACT = {Given the continued challenge of dispersion, for practical purposes, it is of interest to evaluate the impact of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) at different states of clustering on the eventual performance properties of cement paste. This study evaluated the clustering of MWCNTs and the resultant effect on the mechanical and electrical properties when incorporated into cement paste. Cement pastes containing different concentrations of MWCNTs (up to 0.5% by mass of cement) with/without surfactant were characterized. MWCNT clustering was assessed qualitatively in an aqueous solution through visual observation, and quantitatively in cement matrices using a scanning electron microscopy technique. Additionally, the corresponding 28-day compressive strength, tensile strength, and electrical conductivity were measured. Results showed that the use of surfactant led to a downward shift in the MWCNT clustering size distribution in the matrices of MWCNT/cement paste, indicating improved dispersion of MWCNTs. The compressive strength, tensile strength, and electrical conductivity of the composites with surfactant increased with MWCNT concentration and were higher than those without surfactant at all concentrations.},

It is demonstrated that the precured PDMS liquid film could influence the depositing morphology of coalesced silver precursor inkjet droplets. Accordingly, continuous and uniform lines with a semi-wrapped structure were fabricated on the PDMS surface. When the printed silver precursor was reduced to Ag nanoparticles, the fabricated conductive film exhibited good transparency and high bendability. This work presented a facile way to fabricate flexible patterns on a PDMS surface without any complicated modification or special equipment. Meanwhile, an in situ hydrazine reduction of Ag has been reported using the vapor phase method in the fabricating process.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, we address the synthesis of nano-coalesced microstructured zinc oxide thin films via a simple thermal evaporation process. The role of synthesis temperature on the structural, morphological, and optical properties of the prepared zinc oxide samples was deeply investigated. The obtained photoluminescence and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy outcomes will be used to discuss the surface structure defects of the prepared samples. The results indicated that the prepared samples are polycrystalline in nature, and the sample prepared at 700 °C revealed a tremendously c-axis oriented zinc oxide. The temperature-driven morphological evolution of the zinc oxide nano-coalesced microstructures was perceived, resulting in transformation of quasi-mountain chain-like to pyramidal textured zinc oxide with increasing the synthesis temperature. The results also impart that the sample prepared at 500 °C shows a higher percentage of the zinc interstitial and oxygen vacancies. Furthermore, the intensity of the photoluminescence emission in the ultraviolet region was enhanced as the heating temperature increased from 500 °C to 700 °C. Lastly, the growth mechanism of the zinc oxide nano-coalesced microstructures is discussed according to the reaction conditions.},

Detailed theoretical studies of the structural properties, elastic properties, density of states, and mechanical properties of these two C3N4 phases were carried out using first-principles calculations. The calculated elastic constants and the hardness revealed that t-C3N4 is ultra-incompressible and superhard, with a high bulk modulus of 375 GPa and a high hardness of 80 GPa. m-C3N4 and t-C3N4 both exhibit large anisotropy with respect to Poisson’s ratio, shear modulus, and Young’s modulus. Moreover, m-C3N4 is a quasi-direct-bandgap semiconductor, with a band gap of 4.522 eV, and t-C3N4 is also a quasi-direct-band-gap semiconductor, with a band gap of 4.210 eV, with the HSE06 functional.},

ABSTRACT = {In the aerospace and aviation sectors, the damage tolerance concept has been applied widely so that the modeling analysis of fatigue crack growth has become more and more significant. Since the process of crack propagation is highly nonlinear and determined by many factors, such as applied stress, plastic zone in the crack tip, length of the crack, etc., it is difficult to build up a general and flexible explicit function to accurately quantify this complicated relationship. Fortunately, the artificial neural network (ANN) is considered a powerful tool for establishing the nonlinear multivariate projection which shows potential in handling the fatigue crack problem. In this paper, a novel fatigue crack calculation algorithm based on a radial basis function (RBF)-ANN is proposed to study this relationship from the experimental data. In addition, a parameter called the equivalent stress intensity factor is also employed as training data to account for loading interaction effects. The testing data is then placed under constant amplitude loading with different stress ratios or overloads used for model validation. Moreover, the Forman and Wheeler equations are also adopted to compare with our proposed algorithm. The current investigation shows that the ANN-based approach can deliver a better agreement with the experimental data than the other two models, which supports that the RBF-ANN has nontrivial advantages in handling the fatigue crack growth problem. Furthermore, it implies that the proposed algorithm is possibly a sophisticated and promising method to compute fatigue crack growth in terms of loading interaction effects.},

ABSTRACT = {The mining industry relies heavily on empirical analysis for design and prediction. An empirical design method, called the critical span graph, was developed specifically for rock stability analysis in entry-type excavations, based on an extensive case-history database of cut and fill mining in Canada. This empirical span design chart plots the critical span against rock mass rating for the observed case histories and has been accepted by many mining operations for the initial span design of cut and fill stopes. Different types of analysis have been used to classify the observed cases into stable, potentially unstable and unstable groups. The main purpose of this paper is to present a new method for defining rock stability areas of the critical span graph, which applies machine learning classifiers (support vector machine and extreme learning machine). The results show a reasonable correlation with previous guidelines. These machine learning methods are good tools for developing empirical methods, since they make no assumptions about the regression function. With this software, it is easy to add new field observations to a previous database, improving prediction output with the addition of data that consider the local conditions for each mine.},

ABSTRACT = {Halloysite (HNT) is treated with sulfuric acid and the physico-chemical properties of its morphology, surface activity, physical and chemical properties have been investigated when HNT is exposed to sulfuric acid with treatment periods of 1 h (H1), 3 h (H3), 8 h (H8), and 21 h (H21). The significance of this and similar work lies in the importance of using HNT as a functional material in nanocomposites. The chemical structure was characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The spectrum demonstrates that the hydroxyl groups were active for grafting modification using sulfuric acid, promoting a promising potential use for halloysite in ceramic applications as filler for novel clay-polymer nanocomposites. From the X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectrum, it can be seen that the sulfuric acid breaks down the HNT crystal structure and alters it into amorphous silica. In addition, the FESEM images reveal that the sulfuric acid treatment dissolves the AlO6 octahedral layers and induces the disintegration of SiO4 tetrahedral layers, resulting in porous nanorods. The Bruncher-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area and total pore volume of HNTs showed an increase. The reaction of the acid with both the outer and inner surfaces of the nanotubes causes the AlO6 octahedral layers to dissolve, which leads to the breakdown and collapse of the tetrahedral layers of SiO4. The multi-fold results presented in this paper serve as a guide for further HNT functional treatment for producing new and advanced nanocomposites.},

ABSTRACT = {In this study, we devised a novel nanofibrous adsorbent made of polyethersulfone (PES) for removal of methylene blue (MB) dye pollutant from water. The polymer shows a low isoelectric point thus at elevated pHs and, being nanofibrous, can offer a huge highly hydroxylated surface area for adsorption of cationic MB molecules. As an extra challenge, to augment the adsorbent’s properties in terms of adsorption capacity in neutral and acidic conditions and thermal stability, vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) nanoparticles were added to the nanofibers. Adsorption data were analyzed according to the Freundlich adsorption model. The thermodynamic parameters verified that only at basic pH is the adsorption spontaneous and in general the process is entropy-driven and endothermic. The kinetics of the adsorption process was evaluated by the pseudo-first- and pseudo-second-order models. The latter model exhibited the highest correlation with data. In sum, the adsorbent showed a promising potential for dye removal from industrial dyeing wastewater systems, especially when envisaging their alkaline and hot conditions.},

ABSTRACT = {A preliminary study of the mechanical properties of auxetic cellular material consisting of re-entrant hexagonal honeycombs is presented. For different scales of the honeycombs, the finite element method (FEM) and experimental models are used to perform a parametric analysis on the effects of the Poisson’s ratio (cell angle) and the relative density (cell thickness) of honeycombs on bearing capacity and dynamic performance of the auxetic material. The analysis demonstrates that the ultimate bearing capacity of the presented auxetic cellular material is scale-independent when the Poisson’s ratio and the relative density are kept constant. The relationship between the geometric parameters and vibration level difference of the honeycombs is also revealed, which can be divided into two converse parts around the Poisson’s ratio v = − 1.5 . When v is smaller than −1.5, increasing the cell thickness leads to an increase in the vibration level difference of the honeycombs. Moreover, the dynamic performance of thin-walled honeycombs is greatly influenced by the scale of the honeycombs, especially for the ones with small Poisson’s ratio. These conclusions are verified by a frequency response test and a good agreement between the numerical results and experimental data is achieved.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper investigates the effect of curing temperature on the hydration, microstructure, compressive strength, and transport of cement pastes modified with TiO2 nanoparticles. These characteristics of cement pastes were studied using non-evaporable water content measurement, X-ray diffraction (XRD), compressive strength test, electrical resistivity and porosity measurements, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). It was shown that temperature enhanced the early hydration. The cement pastes cured at elevated temperatures generally showed an increase in compressive strength at an early age compared to the cement paste cured at room temperature, but the strength gain decreased at later ages. The electrical resistivity of the cement pastes cured at elevated temperatures was found to decrease more noticeably at late ages compared to that of the room temperature cured cement paste. SEM examination indicated that hydration product was more uniformly distributed in the microstructure of the cement paste cured at room temperature compared to the cement pastes cured at elevated temperatures. It was observed that high temperature curing decreased the compressive strength and electrical resistivity of the cement pastes at late ages in a more pronounced manner when higher levels of TiO2 nanoparticles were added.},

ABSTRACT = {A metal-based matrix is usually used for the fabrication of diamond bits in order to achieve favorable properties and easy processing. In the effort to reduce the cost and to attain the desired bit properties, researchers have brought more attention to diamond composites. In this paper, Fe-based impregnated diamond composites for drill bits were fabricated by using a pressureless infiltration sintering method at 970 °C for 5 min. In addition, boron was introduced into Fe-based diamond composites. The influence of boron on the density, hardness, bending strength, grinding ratio, and microstructure was investigated. An Fe-based diamond composite with 1 wt % B has an optimal overall performance, the grinding ratio especially improving by 80%. After comparing with tungsten carbide (WC)-based diamond composites with and without 1 wt % B, results showed that the Fe-based diamond composite with 1 wt % B exhibits higher bending strength and wear resistance, being satisfactory to bit needs.},

ABSTRACT = {The antifungal, antibacterial, and antioxidant activity of four commercial essential oils (EOs) (thyme, clove, rosemary, and tea tree) from Romanian production were studied in order to assess them as bioactive compounds for active food packaging applications. The chemical composition of the oils was determined with the Folin–Ciocâlteu method and gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry and flame ionization detectors, and it was found that they respect the AFNOR/ISO standard limits. The EOs were tested against three food spoilage fungi—Fusarium graminearum, Penicillium corylophilum, and Aspergillus brasiliensis—and three potential pathogenic food bacteria—Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Listeria monocytogenes—using the disc diffusion method. It was found that the EOs of thyme, clove, and tea tree can be used as antimicrobial agents against the tested fungi and bacteria, thyme having the highest inhibitory effect. Concerning antioxidant activity determined by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2’-azino-bis 3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) methods, it has been established that the clove oil exhibits the highest activity because of its high phenolic content. Promising results were obtained by their incorporation into chitosan emulsions and films, which show potential for food packaging. Therefore, these essential oils could be suitable alternatives to chemical additives, satisfying the consumer demand for naturally preserved food products ensuring its safety.},

ABSTRACT = {The advancement in science and technology has led to luffa sponge (LS) being widely used as a natural material in industrial application because of its polyporous structure and light texture. To enhance the utility of LS fibers as the reinforcement of lightweight composite materials, the current study investigates their water absorption, mechanical properties, anatomical characteristics and thermal performance. Hence, moisture regain and tensile properties of LS fiber bundles were measured in accordance with American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) standards while their structural characteristics were investigated via microscopic observation. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to observe the surface morphology and fractured surface of fiber bundles. The test results show that the special structure where the phloem tissues degenerate to cavities had a significant influence on the mechanical properties of LS fiber bundles. Additionally, the transverse sectional area occupied by fibers in a fiber bundle (SF), wall thickness, ratio of wall to lumen of fiber cell, and crystallinity of cellulose had substantial impact on the mechanical properties of LS fiber bundles. Furthermore, the density of fiber bundles of LS ranged within 385.46–468.70 kg/m3, significantly less than that of jute (1360.40 kg/m3) and Arenga engleri (950.20 kg/m3). However, LS fiber bundles demonstrated superior specific modulus than Arenga engleri.},

ABSTRACT = {In this work, the reflectance, optical absorption, and band gap have been determined for CdTe thin films grown on planar and microstructured substrates. The treated surface was prepared by laser ablation of a silicon wafer, forming holes in a periodic arrangement. Thin films were grown by pulsed laser ablation on silicon samples kept at 200 °C inside a vacuum chamber. The presence of CdTe was verified with X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy indicating a nanocrystalline zinc blended structure. The optical absorption of thin films was calculated by using the Fresnel laws and the experimental reflectance spectrum. Results show that reflectance of 245 nm films deposited on modified substrates is reduced by up to a factor of two than the obtained on unchanged silicon and the optical absorption is 16% higher at ~456 nm. Additionally, it was determined that the band gap energy for planar and microstructured films is about 1.44 eV for both cases.},

ABSTRACT = {The microstructure of plastic bonded explosives (PBXs) is known to influence behavior during mechanical deformation, but characterizing the microstructure can be challenging. For example, the explosive crystals and binder in formulations such as PBX 9501 do not have sufficient X-ray contrast to obtain three-dimensional data by in situ, absorption contrast imaging. To address this difficulty, we have formulated a series of PBXs using octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocine (HMX) crystals and low-density binder systems. The binders were hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB) or glycidyl azide polymer (GAP) cured with a commercial blend of acrylic monomers/oligomers. The binder density is approximately half of the HMX, allowing for excellent contrast using in situ X-ray computed tomography (CT) imaging. The samples were imaged during unaxial compression using micro-scale CT in an interrupted in situ modality. The rigidity of the binder was observed to significantly influence fracture, crystal-binder delamination, and flow. Additionally, 2D slices from the segmented 3D images were meshed for finite element simulation of the mesoscale response. At low stiffness, the binder and crystal do not delaminate and the crystals move with the material flow; at high stiffness, marked delamination is noted between the crystals and the binder, leading to very different mechanical properties. Initial model results exhibit qualitatively similar delamination.},

ABSTRACT = {Innovation in construction materials (CM) implies changing their composition by incorporating raw materials, usually non-traditional ones, which confer the desired characteristics. However, this practice may have unknown risks. This paper discusses the ecotoxicological potential associated with raw and construction materials, and proposes and applies a methodology for the assessment of their ecotoxicological potential. This methodology is based on existing laws, such as Regulation (European Commission) No. 1907/2006 (REACH—Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals) and Regulation (European Commission) No. 1272/2008 (CLP—Classification, Labelling and Packaging). Its application and validation showed that raw material without clear evidence of ecotoxicological potential, but with some ability to release chemicals, can lead to the formulation of a CM with a slightly lower hazardousness in terms of chemical characterization despite a slightly higher ecotoxicological potential than the raw materials. The proposed methodology can be a useful tool for the development and manufacturing of products and the design choice of the most appropriate CM, aiming at the reduction of their environmental impact and contributing to construction sustainability.},

ABSTRACT = {Prosumer (producing consumer)-based desktop additive manufacturing has been enabled by the recent radical reduction in 3-D printer capital costs created by the open-source release of the self-replicating rapid prototype (RepRap). To continue this success, there have been some efforts to improve reliability, which are either too expensive or lacked automation. A promising method to improve reliability is to use computer vision, although the success rates are still too low for widespread use. To overcome these challenges an open source low-cost reliable real-time optimal monitoring platform for 3-D printing from double cameras is presented here. This error detection system is implemented with low-cost web cameras and covers 360 degrees around the printed object from three different perspectives. The algorithm is developed in Python and run on a Raspberry Pi3 mini-computer to reduce costs. For 3-D printing monitoring in three different perspectives, the systems are tested with four different 3-D object geometries for normal operation and failure modes. This system is tested with two different techniques in the image pre-processing step: SIFT and RANSAC rescale and rectification, and non-rescale and rectification. The error calculations were determined from the horizontal and vertical magnitude methods of 3-D reconstruction images. The non-rescale and rectification technique successfully detects the normal printing and failure state for all models with 100% accuracy, which is better than the single camera set up only. The computation time of the non-rescale and rectification technique is two times faster than the SIFT and RANSAC rescale and rectification technique.},

ABSTRACT = {Tri-block copolymer styrene–butadiene (SBS) is extensively applied in bituminous highway construction due to its high elasticity and excellent weather resistance. With the extension of time, tri-block structural SBS automatically degrades into bi-block structural SB- with some terminal oxygen-containing groups under the comprehensive effects of light, heat, oxygen, etc. In this paper, the effects of aging temperature, aging time and oxygen concentration on the molecular structure of thermo-oxidative aged SBS were mainly investigated using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and the correlation between oxygen-containing groups and thermal properties (TG–DTG) was further discussed. The FTIR and XPS results show that rapid decomposition of SBS will occur with increments of aging temperature, aging time and oxygen concentration, and a large number of oxygen-containing groups such as –OH, C=O, –COOH, etc. will be formed during thermo-oxidative aging. In short-term aging, changes in aging temperature and oxygen concentration have a significant impact on the structural damage of SBS. However, in long-term aging, it has no further effect on the molecular structure of SBS or on increasing oxygen concentration. The TG and DTG results indicate that the concentration of substances with low molecular weight gradually increases with the improvement of the degree of aging of the SBS, while the initial decomposition rate increases at the beginning of thermal weightlessness and the decomposition rate slows down in comparison with neat SBS. From the relation between the XPS and TG results, it can be seen that the initial thermal stability of SBS rapidly reduces as the relative concentration of the oxygen-containing groups accumulates around 3%, while the maximum decomposition temperature slowly decreases when the relative concentration of the oxygen-containing groups is more than 3%, due to the difficult damage to strong bonds on the molecular structure of aged SBS.},

ABSTRACT = {Direct Metal Deposition (DMD) is an additive manufacturing (AM) process capable of producing large components using a layer by layer deposition of molten powder. DMD is increasingly investigated due to its higher deposition rate and the possibility to produce large structural components specifically for the aerospace industry. During fabrication, a complex thermal history is experienced in different regions of the workpiece, depending on the process parameters and part geometry. The thermal history induces residual stress accumulation in the buildup, which is the main cause of distortions. In order to control the process and enhance the product quality, the understanding of the workpiece temperature is substantial. In this study, two methods to predict temperature evolution during the DMD process are introduced based on analytical and finite element methods. The objective is to compare these methods to experimental results and to provide more insights about their capabilities to predict accurately the temperature gradient, the cooling rate, and the melt pool geometry. A comparison of the computational time is also provided. Based on the results of the investigation, It appears that the analytical method provides an effective and accurate method to understand the influence of the process on the workpiece temperature.},

ABSTRACT = {The modification of tribological properties of highly loaded components by selecting a suitable manufacturing process is state-of-the-art. Beyond the generation of microgeometrical structures, the present study investigates the potential of chemical alterations, i.e., metalworking fluid additives engaged in a grinding process to improve the chemical surface properties of machined gear synchronizations. These gearbox components ensure a uniform switching operation by harmonizing the number of revolutions between the power transmitting components by friction. A short running-in phase and a friction coefficient which is constant over the entire duration of use are required. The results show that the addition of polysulfide as well as zincdialkyldithiophosphate in the metalworking fluid could considerably reduce the friction coefficient fluctuations and the running-in phase of the generated synchronizations in later operation tests. The wear distances were lower although the machined parts revealed higher surface roughnesses as the reference workpieces, which indicates the formation of sorption or reaction layers of the additives with the metal surface.},

The investigation of protein films in planar surfaces is performed by combining quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements with all-atomic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We found that BSA and β -lactoglobulin form compact monolayers, almost without interstices between the proteins. However, β -casein adsorbs forming multilayers. The study of the electrokinetic mobility of protein-coated latex microspheres shows substantial condensation of ions from the buffer over the complexes, as predicted from ion condensation theories. The electrokinetic behavior of the latex-protein complexes is dominated by the charge of the proteins and the phenomenon of ion condensation, whereas the charge of the latex colloids plays only a minor role.},

ABSTRACT = {In recent years, post-installed anchors are widely used to connect structural members and to fix appliances to load-bearing elements. A bonded anchor typically denotes a threaded bar placed into a borehole filled with adhesive mortar. The high complexity of the problem, owing to the multiple materials and failure mechanisms involved, requires a numerical support for the experimental investigation. A reliable model able to reproduce a system’s short-term behavior is needed before the development of a more complex framework for the subsequent investigation of the lifetime of fasteners subjected to various deterioration processes can commence. The focus of this contribution is the development and validation of such a model for bonded anchors under pure tension load. Compression, modulus, fracture and splitting tests are performed on standard concrete specimens. These serve for the calibration and validation of the concrete constitutive model. The behavior of the adhesive mortar layer is modeled with a stress-slip law, calibrated on a set of confined pull-out tests. The model validation is performed on tests with different configurations comparing load-displacement curves, crack patterns and concrete cone shapes. A model sensitivity analysis and the evaluation of the bond stress and slippage along the anchor complete the study.},

ABSTRACT = {Kraft lignin (KL) was thermally treated at 500 to 1000 °C in an inert atmosphere. Carbon nanostructure parameters of thermally treated KL in terms of amorphous carbon fraction, aromaticity, and carbon nanocrystallites lateral size (La), thickness (Lc), and interlayer space (d002) were analyzed quantitatively using X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. Experimental results indicated that increasing temperature reduced amorphous carbon but increased aromaticity in thermally treated KL materials. The Lc value of thermally treated KL materials averaged 0.85 nm and did not change with temperature. The d002 value decreased from 3.56 Å at 500 °C to 3.49 Å at 1000 °C. The La value increased from 0.7 to 1.4 nm as temperature increased from 500 to 1000 °C. A nanostructure model was proposed to describe thermally treated KL under 1000 °C. The thermal stability of heat treated KL increased with temperature rising from 500 to 800 °C.},

ABSTRACT = {Advanced high-strength steel (AHSS) is subject to a high deformation in geometry due to spring-back and high forces during forming. Therefore, dieless single-point incremental forming supported by induction heating was introduced. When a HCT980C steel part was studied, it was observed that the geometrical accuracy increased by forming using a 15 kW induction power, whereas a high deviation in profile geometry was observed by forming using a 5 kW induction power. The forming forces decreased by 66.63% compared with those resulting from forming at room temperature. At the same time, the HCT980C steel part cracked and failed to reach its designed depth when forming at room temperature. Regulating the tensile strength and hardness of the formed part and preventing their reduction was achieved by increasing the feed rate continuously as a function of the formed part’s growing depth. Moreover, the distribution of the induction heating temperature was reduced by introducing the new forming strategy. A cone wall angle of 70° was flexibly formed from a HCT980C steel sheet when the new strategy was applied.},

ABSTRACT = {The melt-extrusion process is utilized in the pharmaceutical arena for the manufacturing of a variety of dosage forms and formulations, including solid dispersions. This technology is considered an efficient and continuous dosage form manufacturing method. However, there are potential challenges mainly because, during hot-melt extrusion, polymers are subject to mechanical and thermal degradation. Mechanical degradation may be induced by the shear effects imposed by the rotating screw. Thermal degradation results from high temperatures and includes random scission, scission from the ends of the polymer and unzipping of substitute groups. This paper endeavors to understand the impact of thermal and/or mechanical components of the melt-extrusion process on the stability of a pH sensitive polymer, namely Shellac. Correlation between the screw speeds and processing temperature profile was examined in the context of the overall degradation profile of the polymer. The results suggest that the processing stability of Shellac was reliant on optimization of screw speed (rpm) and process temperature.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper presents a new numerical approach for modelling the 3D printing process of fibre reinforced polymer composites by fused deposition modelling (FDM). The approach is based on the coupling between two particle methods, namely smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) and discrete element method (DEM). The coupled SPH-DEM model has distinctive advantages in dealing with the free surface flow, large deformation of fibres, and/or fibre-fibre interaction that are involved in the FDM process. A numerical feasibility study is carried out to demonstrate its capability for both short and continuous fibre reinforced polymer composites, with promising results achieved for the rheological flow and fibre orientation and deformation.},

ABSTRACT = {Under the support of an SBIR Phase II/IIB grant from the National Science Foundation, OMAX has developed and commercialized micro abrasive (µAWJ), culminating A MicroMAX® JetMachining® Center technology for meso-micro machining. AWJ inherently possesses technological and manufacturing merits unmatched by most machine tools. With the commercialization of µAWJ technology, waterjet is now fully capable of multi-mode machining most materials from macro to micro scales (the 7M advantage). Novel accessories and software facilitate machining precision 2D and 3D parts with a wide range of part size and thickness. The versatile waterjet is particularly advantageous for machining difficult and delicate materials, such as alloys, hardened steel, composites, and laminates. One unique capability is machining composites and nanomaterials comprised of metals (reflective and conductive), non-metals (non-conductive), and anything in between. The 7M advantage of waterjet has been taking advantage by machining sample parts made of a variety of advanced materials that are difficult, or even impossible, to machine otherwise.},

ABSTRACT = {Punching processes are widely used for producing automobile parts, mechanical components, and other parts. To produce highly accurate parts, it is important to estimate the ratio of the sheared surface to the cut surface. Many researchers have applied the finite-element method (FEM) to analyze the ratio of the sheared surface to the fracture surface on cut surfaces by using ductile fracture criteria. However, it is difficult to determine the fracture criteria on the cut surface by tensile tests or bending tests because the punching process involves many complicated steps. In this study, FEM was applied to the punching process to determine the values of critical fracture criteria (C) by using the ductile fracture criteria proposed by Cockcroft and Latham, Oyane, and Ayada. The ductile fracture criteria were compared with the boundary between the shear surface and the fracture surfaces using experiments performed with a simple punching system. The values of the ductile fracture criteria for the fracture initiation of the formed cut surface were predicted under various clearances between the punch and the die with various punch diameters. The influence of stress triaxiality and the effect of punch diameter on the sheared surface length are also discussed.},

ABSTRACT = {The main aim of this work was to evaluate the influence and optimize the factors of the TIG-MIG/MAG hybrid welding process on the geometry of the weld bead. An experimental design using the Taguchi methodology (robust design method) was used to conduct the experiments. The experiments were carried out according to an orthogonal matrix with 27 experiments, with three replicates each, totaling 81 test specimens. The factors (MIG/MAG shielding gas type, MIG/MAG voltage, MIG/MAG wire feed, gas flow rate of TIG, electric current intensity of TIG and welding speed) were varied with three levels each. Penetration, heat-affected zone (HAZ), bead width and bead height were the response variables analyzed. The results showed that the penetration was significantly influenced by the MIG/MAG wire feed, MIG/MAG shielding gas type, MIG/MAG voltage and welding speed. The HAZ has been influenced by MIG/MAG voltage, MIG/MAG shielding gas type, welding speed and electric current intensity of TIG. All factors had effects on the width, except the MIG/MAG wire feed. The bead height was significantly influenced by the MIG/MAG wire feed and by the electric current intensity of TIG. Optimizing the process was performed, so that for each output variable, the values of the factors that should be used were indicated, and the optimization was confirmed by welding test specimens.},

ABSTRACT = {In the present study, the mesostructure of a fused deposition modeling (FDM) processed part is considered for the investigation of its mechanical behavior. The layers of FDM printed part behave as a unidirectional fiber reinforced laminae, which are treated as an orthotropic material. The finite element (FE) procedure to find elastic moduli of a layer of the FDM processed part is presented. The mesostructure of the part that would be obtained from the process is replicated in FE models in order to find stiffness matrix of a layer. Two distinctive architectures of mesostructure are considered in the study to predict the mechanical behavior of the parts. Also, influences of layer thickness, road shape and air gap on the elastic properties of a material are investigated. Further, the parts fabricated with FDM process are treated as laminate structures. From the numerical results, it is seen that the elastic moduli are governed by mesostructures. Our laminate results are validated with experimental to demonstrate the use of classical laminate theory (CLT) for FDM parts. The elastic moduli (E1, E2, G12, ν12) of a layer used in the analysis are calculated from FE simulations. This study establishes relationship between mesostructure and macro mechanical properties of the part.},

ABSTRACT = {The need to manufacture a copy of a mechanical part typically arises when a single replacement part is necessary and is out of stock or out of production altogether. For parts with intricate details and associated accuracy requirements, investment casting may be preferred to machining, for size and detail reasons, or 3D printing, for material reasons. This work applies the digital manufacturing paradigm to one-off vacuum-aided rapid investment casting focusing on the process chain rather than on engineering issues. 3D laser scanning, digital model construction by surface fitting, casting model making by exploiting additive manufacturing, material investigation using scanning electron microscopy, casting simulation exploring process parameter scenarios, as well as the corresponding implementation on a vacuum casting machine are the pertinent interlinked steps and techniques. The added value of this work is that for each process link the important steps and the potential pitfalls are analyzed in detail using as an example a cylinder liner from a model car engine. Quality of the result was quite acceptable, the main benefit of the streamlined approach being that “right-first-time” parts can be achieved.},

ABSTRACT = {The core technique of electric storage water heaters is the manufacture of the tanks, and the welding technique is the key technology of the tank manufacture. A company producing water heaters received feedback from its after-sales that a large quantity of water leakage from the tanks was found in the market. A follow-up on the manufacturing site by the researchers showed that the position of the water leakage defects mostly happens in the welds of the tanks. Series of experiments were conducted to investigate the mechanical properties, residual stress, and diffusible hydrogen content of the longitudinal weld of the tank. Results of the mechanical properties showed that both the micro-hardness and the tensile strength of the welds are higher than the base metal. There are higher residual compressive stresses in the weld center and the adjacent-weld zone. Vertical residual compressive stress decreases first and then increases (149 MPa–28 MPa–134 MPa) from the weld ends to the middle, whilst the transversal stress decreases continuously (332 MPa~240 MPa) from the weld center to the heat affected zone. After enameling, the longitudinal welds’ peak micro-hardness of coarse grained region reduces by 30.9 HV1, and the average micro-hardness of the HAZ reduces by 5 HV1. The average vertical residual compressive stress difference of the same test points reduces from 270.6 MPa to 20.4 MPa. It proves that enameling can improve the mechanical property of the longitudinal welds.},

ABSTRACT = {Rotary ultrasonic machining (RUM) is a nontraditional and cost-effective machining method for hard and brittle materials, such as ceramics, optical glass, composite materials, and so on. RUM is a hybrid process that combines the material removal mechanisms of diamond abrasive grinding and ultrasonic machining. In RUM, a rotating cutting tool with metal-bonded diamond abrasive particles is ultrasonically vibrated in the axial direction while the tool spindle is fed toward the workpiece at a constant feedrate to remove material. It has been reported that continuous rotary ultrasonic machining has been successfully used to drill holes in K9 glass. Intermittent rotary ultrasonic machining is a newly introduced ultrasonic machining process, which uses a slotted cutting tool instead of a common metal bonded diamond cutting tool as used in continuous rotary ultrasonic machining. There has been no reported study to compare the effects of intermittent RUM and continuous RUM when machining K9 glass. This paper, for the first time, presents an experimental investigation to compare intermittent RUM and continuous RUM when machining K9 glass from the perspectives of cutting force, surface roughness, and chipping size.},

ABSTRACT = {Dual-phase high carbon steel is widely used in mining and in chemical industry applications in highly abrasive environments due to its excellent hardness and abrasion resistance. In recent years, the use of less expensive but more corrosive solutions in industrial processes has become more common. As a result, detailed understanding of the corrosion behaviour of dual-phase high carbon steel is needed; an issue that has, to date, been little-studied. This study investigates in detail the corrosion behaviour of dual-phase high carbon steel in a sodium chloride solution at different times, at the macro- and nano-scale, using various techniques. Using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and 3D laser-scanning confocal microscopy, the corrosion behaviour of this important industrial steel was investigated at the micro-scale, then by using atomic force microscopy (AFM) it was further investigated at the nano-scale. The results reveal preferential corrosion attack on the retained austenitic phase, rather than the martensite phase, which is due to the carbon partitioning between martensite and austenite in this grade of steel.},

ABSTRACT = {ZnO, Al-doped ZnO (AZO), and Ga-doped ZnO (GZO) semiconductor thin films were deposited on glass substrates via a sol-gel spin-coating process for application in a photoconductive ultraviolet (UV) detector. The doping concentrations of Al and Ga were 1.0 at % in the precursor solutions. In this study, the microstructural features and the optical and electrical properties of sol-gel-derived ZnO, AZO, and GZO thin films were compared, and the performance of ZnO-based UV photodetectors under ultraviolet A (UVA) light were measured. Experimental results confirmed the synthesis of single-phase nanocrystalline ZnO-based thin films and the successful substitution of Al and Ga into Zn sites in ZnO crystals. The results also demonstrated that the optical transmittance and electrical properties of ZnO thin films could be improved by Al and Ga doping. UV photodetectors based on ZnO-based thin films, having a metal-semiconductor-metal (MSM) configuration, were fabricated with Al inter-digitated electrodes. All photodetectors showed an ohmic nature between semiconductor and electrode contacts and exhibited a sharp increase in photocurrent under illumination with UVA light. We found that the MSM UV photodetector based on the GZO semiconductor thin film exhibited the best UV response (IUVA/Idark) of 73.3 and the highest photocurrent responsivity of 46.2 A/W under UVA light (power density ~0.825 mW/cm2) at 5 V bias.},

ABSTRACT = {The purpose of this paper is to develop a theoretical derivation on aligning discontinuous carbon fiber with an applied electric field, and prove the theory with experiment. A principle with regard to the occurrence of carbon fiber alignment is presented after an introduction of the electromechanical quantities of dielectrics. Based on this principle, an estimation of the polarizability tensor is employed to calculate the required electric field to achieve fiber alignment in liquid solution (e.g., water, resin, etc.). Individual carbon fiber is modeled as a polarizable dielectric cylinder in liquid resin and its motion under direct current (DC) electrical field is decomposed into a polarization effect and rotation effect. A value of 20.12 V/mm is required to align short carbon fibers (0.15 mm) long in liquid resin and is experimentally validated. Finally, an expression to include weight percentage as a means of controlling pearl-chain formation is derived to change the composite’s electrical conductivity.},

ABSTRACT = {The paper presents the results of tests on the effect of the low calcium fly ash (LCFA) addition, in the amounts of: 0% (LCFA-00), 20% (LCFA-20) and 30% (LCFA-30) by weight of cement, on fracture processes in structural concretes. In the course of the experiments, compressive strength of concrete and fracture toughness for: I (tensile), II (in-plane shear) and III (anti-plane shear) models of cracking were measured. The tests determined the effect of age of concretes modified with LCFA on the analyzed parameters. The experiments were carried out after: 3, 7, 28, 90, 180 and 365 days of curing. Fracture toughness of concretes was determined in terms of the critical stress intensity factors: K I c S , K I I c , K I I I c and then a generalized fracture toughness K c was specified. The obtained results are significant for the analysis of concrete structures subjected to complex loading. The properties of composites with the additive of LCFA depend on the age of the concrete tested. Mature concretes exhibit high fracture toughness at 20% additive of LCFA, while the additive of LCFA in the amount of 30% weight of cement has a beneficial effect on the parameters of concrete only after half a year of curing.},

ABSTRACT = {The laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) technology was adapted for use with non-spherical low-cost water-atomized iron powders. A simplified numerical and experimental modeling approach was applied to determine—in a first approximation—the operation window for the selected powder in terms of laser power, scanning speed, hatching space, and layer thickness. The operation window, delimited by a build rate ranging from 4 to 25 cm3/h, and a volumetric energy density ranging from 50 to 190 J/mm3, was subsequently optimized to improve the density, the mechanical properties, and the surface roughness of the manufactured specimens. Standard L-PBF-built specimens were subjected to microstructural (porosity, grain size) and metrological (accuracy, shrinkage, minimum wall thickness, surface roughness) analyses and mechanical testing (three-point bending and tensile tests). The results of the microstructural, metrological and mechanical characterizations of the L-PBF-built specimens subjected to stress relieve annealing and hot isostatic pressing were then compared with those obtained with conventional pressing-sintering technology. Finally, by using an energy density of 70 J/mm3 and a build rate of 9 cm3/h, it was possible to manufacture 99.8%-dense specimens with an ultimate strength of 330 MPa and an elongation to failure of 30%, despite the relatively poor circularity of the powder used.},

ABSTRACT = {Titanium aluminide (TiAl) turbine blades produced by isothermal forging have recently been implemented in the low-pressure part of commercial aircraft jet engines. However, the slow speed of isothermal forging, costly molybdenum-based dies and the required protective forging atmosphere makes the process rather expensive. Currently, industrial forging is done by closed-die isothermal forging processes with stationary dies. Idle time occurs when single parts are inserted and extracted from the dies. As an interesting alternative for forging small parts, a new set-up is devised and explored in this work, i.e., batch processing. Using a die set which allow for off-line preassembly and preheating, multiple parts can be forged in one stroke. The design of the batch process was based on a new material model, which was implemented into a finite element system to identify the forging parameters. The setup of the press transport system for batch processing, as well as the results of the simulations and forging experiments are presented. A cost comparison between the new process and conventional forging with stationary dies concludes that for smaller parts such as compressor blades, batch processing offers advantages regarding productivity and cost.},

ABSTRACT = {Low-temperature cracking is one of the most common road pavement distress types in Poland. While bitumen performance can be evaluated in detail using bending beam rheometer (BBR) or dynamic shear rheometer (DSR) tests, none of the normalized test methods gives a comprehensive representation of low-temperature performance of the asphalt mixtures. This article presents the Bending Beam Creep test performed at temperatures from −20 °C to +10 °C in order to evaluate the low-temperature performance of asphalt mixtures. Both validation of the method and its utilization for the assessment of eight types of wearing courses commonly used in Poland were described. The performed test indicated that the source of bitumen and its production process (and not necessarily only bitumen penetration) had a significant impact on the low-temperature performance of the asphalt mixtures, comparable to the impact of binder modification (neat, polymer-modified, highly modified) and the aggregate skeleton used in the mixture (Stone Mastic Asphalt (SMA) vs. Asphalt Concrete (AC)). Obtained Bending Beam Creep test results were compared with the BBR bitumen test. Regression analysis confirmed that performing solely bitumen tests is insufficient for comprehensive low-temperature performance analysis.},

In the Z-FLS diagram, strain rate and temperature effects on the major limit strain are reflected by ln(Z). In the current study, the concept of Z-FLS is revisited to provide a practical approach to construct Z-FLS. A Z-FLS then is constructed for magnesium alloy AZ31B sheet material using available experimental forming limit curves. The constructed Z-FLS is used to identify fracture in a non-isothermal warm cup forming process, which was modeled as a coupled thermo-mechanical process. Based on the Z-FLS, the determined limiting draw ratio (LDR) matches well with the published experimental results.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper describes an error separation method for a precision measurement of the run-out of a microdrill bit by using a measurement system consisting of a concentricity gauge and a laser scan micrometer (LSM). The proposed error separation method can achieve a sub-micrometric measurement accuracy of the run-out of the microdrill bit without the requirement of ultra-precision rotary drive devices. In the measurement, the spindle error motion of the concentricity gauge is firstly measured by using the LSM and a small-diameter artifact, instead of the conventionally used displacement probes and large-diameter artifact, in order to determine the fine position of the concentricity gauge when the spindle error motion is at its minimum. The microdrill bit is rotated at the fine position for the measurement of the run-out, so that the influence of the spindle error motion can thus be reduced, which could not be previously realized by commercial measurement systems. Experiments were carried out to verify the feasibility of the proposed error separation method for the measurement of the run-out of the microdrill bit. The measurement results and the measurement uncertainty confirmed that the proposed method is reliable for the run-out measurement with sub-micrometric accuracy.},

ABSTRACT = {Polymer optics are widely used in various applications, replacing traditional glass lenses. The ability to create free-form and micro-structured optics, as well as fast replication, gives them major advantages over traditional glass lenses. However, the fabrication of complex optical components requires full process control and understanding of influencing factors on the quality of the polymer optical parts. In this work, a curved diffractive optical element (DOE) is fabricated using injection compression molding. Different gate designs were evaluated and the movement of the compression stamper was optimized to obtain good filling behavior. The process stability was analyzed and improved by controlling the melt temperature precisely. Finally, the molding parameters were optimized, focusing on the mold temperature, melt temperature and compression force. Curved diffractive optical elements were replicated with feature sizes of 1.6 μm. The experiments showed that all aspects of the molding process have to be controlled perfectly to produce complex polymer optics. High mold temperatures and compression force are necessary to replicate micro-structured features. The work presents a broad investigation and description of the fabrication process and their influences.},

ABSTRACT = {A precise characterization of material behavior is necessary to identify yield criteria or hardening laws for an accurate numerical design of sheet metal forming processes. Current models like Yld2000-2d or Hill’48 do not consider the plane strain state, though this condition is primary cause of failure in deep drawing. It is anticipated that an improved yield locus contour which considers the stress under plane strain conditions leads to better results in numerical simulations of a deep drawing process. Within this contribution, a new experimental setup to characterize both principal stress components under plane strain as additional input data for material modelling is presented. Therefore, hydraulic bulge tests are carried out with a novel elliptical die, which implements a plane strain condition. Moreover, the improvement of the material model is investigated exemplarily for the three sheet metal alloys DC06, DP600 and AA5182. The resulting material parameters are used to identify the yield locus for plane strain by varying the yield locus exponent of Yld2000-2d. The results prove that considering plane strain yield locus results in a better sheet thickness distribution in comparison to conventional modelling of the deep drawing process.},

ABSTRACT = {Machining grooves and ridges (peaks) into the surface of wooden deckboards reduces undesirable checking that develops when “profiled” boards are exposed to the weather. We aim to develop improved profiles for amabilis fir decking to reduce its susceptibility to checking, and also to examine whether profiling influences distortion (cupping) of deckboards. We systematically varied radii of grooves and peaks, and the heights and widths of peaks in profiled deckboards, exposed them to the weather, and measured checking and cupping of boards. Profiling significantly reduced the numbers and sizes of checks in amabilis fir deckboards, but increased cupping. Profiles with narrow grooves and tall peaks were generally better at restricting checking than profiles with wide grooves and shorter peaks. Our results suggest that one of the profiles we tested would be better at restricting checking than profiles used previously to manufacture profiled decking from amabilis fir. We conclude that the surface checking of profiled amabilis fir decking can be significantly reduced by altering the geometry of surface profiles. In principal, the same approach could be used with other softwood species that have potential to capture a share of the large and important market for wood decking.},

ABSTRACT = {In this study, a precision motion stage, whose design utilizes a single shaft supported from the bottom by an air bearing and voice coil actuators in complementary double configuration, is evaluated for its dynamic properties, motion accuracy, and potential machining force response, through modal testing, laser interferometric metrology, and spectral analysis, respectively. Modal testing is carried out using two independent methods, which are both based on impact hammer testing. Results are compared with each other and with the predicted natural frequencies based on design calculations. Laser interferometry has been used with varying optics to measure the geometric errors of motion. Laser interferometry results are merged with measured servo errors, estimated thermal errors, and the predicted dynamic response to machining forces, to compile the error budget. Overall accuracy of the stage is calculated as peak-to-valley 5.7 μm with a 2.3 μm non-repeatable part. The accuracy measured is in line with design calculations which incorporated the accuracy grade of the encoder scale and the dimensional tolerances of structural components. The source of the non-repeatable errors remains mostly equivocal, as they fall in the range of random errors of measurement in laser interferometry like alterations of the laser wavelength due to air turbulence.},

ABSTRACT = {The effect of A-site cation ordering on the cathode performance and chemical stability of A-site cation ordered LaBaCo2O5+δ and disordered La0.5Ba0.5CoO3−δ materials are reported. Symmetric half-cells with a proton-conducting BaZr0.9Y0.1O3−δ electrolyte were prepared by ceramic processing, and good chemical compatibility of the materials was demonstrated. Both A-site ordered LaBaCo2O5+δ and A-site disordered La0.5Ba0.5CoO3−δ yield excellent cathode performance with Area Specific Resistances as low as 7.4 and 11.5 Ω·cm2 at 400 °C and 0.16 and 0.32 Ω·cm2 at 600 °C in 3% humidified synthetic air respectively. The oxygen vacancy concentration, electrical conductivity, basicity of cations and crystal structure were evaluated to rationalize the electrochemical performance of the two materials. The combination of high-basicity elements and high electrical conductivity as well as sufficient oxygen vacancy concentration explains the excellent performance of both LaBaCo2O5+δ and La0.5Ba0.5CoO3−δ materials at high temperatures. At lower temperatures, oxygen-deficiency in both materials is greatly reduced, leading to decreased performance despite the high basicity and electrical conductivity. A-site cation ordering leads to a higher oxygen vacancy concentration, which explains the better performance of LaBaCo2O5+δ. Finally, the more pronounced oxygen deficiency of the cation ordered polymorph and the lower chemical stability at reducing conditions were confirmed by coulometric titration.},

ABSTRACT = {Refractory high-entropy alloys (RHEAs) are promising materials used at high temperature, but their low plasticity restricts their application. Based on the valence electron concentration (VEC) principle, four kinds of RHEAs (ZrTiHfV0.5Nb0.5, Zr2.0TiHfVNb2.0, ZrTiHfNb0.5Mo0.5, and ZrTiHfNb0.5Ta0.5) are designed (VEC < 4.5). The experimental results show that the plasticity of these alloys was greatly improved: the static compressive strain was higher than 50% at room temperature (RT), and some elongations were produced in the tensile process. Moreover, the microstructure and phase composition are discussed in detail. The addition of Nb, Mo, and Ta contributed to the high-temperature strength. Finally, the dynamic mechanical properties of these RHEAs with coordination between strength and plasticity are investigated.},

ABSTRACT = {The question, how certain surface layer properties (for example, hardness or roughness) can be specifically influenced in different manufacturing processes, is of great economic interest. A prerequisite for the investigation of the formation of surface layer properties is the metrological assessment of the material stresses during processing. Up to now, no commercial in-process measuring system exists, which is able to determine material stresses in the form of mechanical strains in high-dynamic manufacturing processes with sufficient accuracy. A detailed analysis of the resolution limits shows that speckle photography enables deformation measurements with a resolution in the single-digit nanometer range. Thus, speckle photography basically offers the potential to measure material stresses during processing. Using the example of single-tooth milling, the applicability of speckle photography for in-process stress measurements is demonstrated. Even in such highly dynamic manufacturing processes with cutting speeds up to 10 m/s, the absolute measurement uncertainty of the strain is less than 0.05%. This is more than one order of magnitude lower than the occurring maximal strain. Therefore, speckle photography is suitable for characterizing the dynamic stresses and the material deformations in manufacturing processes.},

ABSTRACT = {Transparent, brittle materials, like glass, are used in various applications due to their advantages of mechanical and optical properties. However, their hard and brittle nature causes significant challenges to researchers when they design and test a new machining process. In order to optimize this time-consuming process, discrete element method (DEM) is applied to simulate the cutting process of soda-lime glass in this study. The first step is to create a synthetic material that behaves like soda-lime glass. Then, the macroproperties are calibrated by adjusting the microparameters of the DEM model to match the mechanical properties of the real soda-lime glass. Finally, orthogonal machining simulations are conducted and model validation are conducted by comparing the predicted cutting forces with those from the orthogonal cutting experiments.},

ABSTRACT = {Silicon nanotubes (SiNTs) have been researched as a promising anode material to replace graphite in next-generation lithium ion batteries. Chemical etching synthesis of SiNTs is a simple, controllable and scalable process for SiNT fabrication, but the environmental emissions are of grave concern. In this paper, the process emissions from chemical etching synthesis of SiNTs as anode for lithium ion batteries is studied through experimental techniques, considering the categories of aqueous wastes, gaseous emissions, aqueous nano-particle emissions, and gaseous aerosol emissions. The synthesized SiNTs are measured at 10 μm length and 1–2.2 μm diameter, and can maintain a specific capacity of over 800 mAh/g after 100 cycles in battery testing. In aqueous waste, the chemical compositions of all elements participating in the chemical etching are experimentally determined, with AgNO3 and Co(NO3)2 identified as the major pollutants. The only gaseous emission generated from the chemical etching synthesis process is H2, with 0.0088 ± 0.0002 mol H2 generated to produce 1.0 mg SiNTs. The aqueous nanoparticle sizes are found to be between 250 nm and 1540 nm. A large number of aerosol nanoparticle emissions of up to 2.96 × 107 particles/cm3 are detected through in situ experimental measurement.},

ABSTRACT = {The fatigue behavior and fracture mechanisms of additively manufactured Ti-6Al-4V specimens are investigated in this study. Three sets of testing samples were fabricated for the assessment of fatigue life. The first batch of samples was built by using Laser-Engineered Net Shaping (LENS) technology, a Direct Energy Deposition (DED) method. Internal voids and defects were induced in a second batch of samples by changing LENS machine processing parameters. Fatigue performance of these samples is compared to the wrought Ti-6Al-4V samples. The effects of machine-induced porosity are assessed on mechanical properties and results are presented in the form of SN curves for the three sets of samples. Fracture mechanisms are examined by using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) to characterize the morphological characteristics of the failure surface. Different fracture surface morphologies are observed for porous and non-porous specimens due to the combination of head write speed and laser power. Formation of defects such as pores, unmelted regions, and gas entrapments affect the failure mechanisms in porous specimens. Non-porous specimens exhibit fatigue properties comparable with that of the wrought specimens, but porous specimens are found to show a tremendous reduced fatigue strength.},

ABSTRACT = {One of the most essential components of the fused deposition modeling (FDM) additive manufacturing (AM) process is the build plate, the surface upon which the part is constructed. These are typically made from aluminum or glass, but there are clear disadvantages to both and restrictions on which materials can be processed on them successfully. This study examined the suitability of heated aluminum-polycarbonate (AL-PC) composite print beds for FDM, looking particularly at the mechanical properties, thermal behavior, deformation behavior, bonding strength with deposited material, printing quality, and range of material usability. Theoretical examination and physical experiments were performed for each of these areas; the results were compared to similar experiments done using heated aluminum and aluminum-glass print beds. Ten distinct materials (ABS, PLA, PET, HIPS, PC, TPU, PVA, nylon, metal PLA, and carbon-fiber PLA) were tested for printing performance. The use of a heated AL-PC print bed was found to be a practical option for most of the materials, particularly ABS and TPU, which are often challenging to process using traditional print bed types. Generally, the results were found to be equivalent to or superior to tempered glass and superior to standard aluminum build plates in terms of printing capability.},

ABSTRACT = {Lightweight design is gaining in importance throughout the engineering sector, and with it, workpieces are becoming increasingly complex. Particularly, thin-walled parts require highly accurate and efficient machining strategies. Such low-rigidity structures usually undergo significant deformations during peripheral milling operations, thus suffering surface errors and a violation of tolerance specifications. This article introduces a general approach to mitigating surface errors during the peripheral milling of thin-walled aluminum workpieces. It incorporates an analytical approach to predicting surface-error characteristics based on geometrical quantities and process parameters, which is presented in detail. Milling experiments, including geometrical measurements of the samples, have been performed to verify the approach. The approach allows for a pre-selection of parameter sets that result in surface errors that can be compensated with minimal effort. Additionally, the introduced model offers a simple criterion to assess potential error mitigation by applying the respective tool-path adjustments. In doing so, the amount of costly numerical simulations or experiments is significantly reduced.},

ABSTRACT = {Monitoring of the relative deviation between commanded and actual tool tip position, which limits the volumetric performance of the machine tool, enables the use of contemporary methods of compensation to reduce tolerance mismatch and the uncertainties of on-machine measurements. The development of a primarily optical sensor setup capable of being integrated into the machine structure without limiting its operating range is presented. The use of a frequency-modulating interferometer and photosensitive arrays in combination with a Gaussian laser beam allows for fast and automated online measurements of the axes’ motion errors and thermal conditions with comparable accuracy, lower cost, and smaller dimensions as compared to state-of-the-art optical measuring instruments for offline machine tool calibration. The development is tested through simulation of the sensor setup based on raytracing and Monte-Carlo techniques.},

The diamond tools being used exhibit customized rectangular tool geometry with a tool width of 10–20 μm. To determine the material impact and the influence of several machining parameters, different structures have been machined, and their geometric and topographic quality has been analyzed.},

ABSTRACT = {Due to their high ductility, high durability, and excellent corrosion resistance, stainless steels are attractive materials for a variety of applications. However, high work hardening, low thermal conductivity, and high built-up edge (BUE) formation make these materials difficult to machine. Rapid tool wear and high cutting forces are the common problems encountered while machining these materials. In the present work, the application of Taguchi optimization methodology has been used to optimize the cutting parameters of the drilling process for machining two stainless steels: austenitic AISI 304 and duplex AISI 2205 under dry conditions. The machining parameters which were chosen to be evaluated in this study are the tool material, cutting speed, and feed rate, while, the response factors to be measured are the tool life (T), cutting force (Fc), and specific cutting energy (ks). Additionally, empirical models were created for predicting the T, Fc and ks using linear regression analysis. The results of this study show that AISI 2205 stainless steel has a shorter tool life, a higher cutting force, and a higher specific cutting energy than AISI 304 stainless steel. In addition, the Taguchi method determined that A3B1C1 and A3B3C1 (A3 = TiN-coated twist drill, B1 = 13 m/min, B3 = 34 m/min, C1 = 0.12 mm/rev) are the optimized combination of levels for the best tool life and the lowest cutting force, respectively. Meanwhile, the optimized combination of levels for all three control factors from the analysis, which provides the lowest specific cutting energy, was found to be A3B1C3 (A3 = TiN-coated twist drill, B1 = 13 m/min, C3 = 0.32 mm/rev) for both stainless steels.},

ABSTRACT = {Probes for CNC machine tools, as every measurement device, have accuracy limited by random errors and by systematic errors. Random errors of these probes are described by a parameter called unidirectional repeatability. Manufacturers of probes for CNC machine tools usually specify only this parameter, while parameters describing systematic errors of the probes, such as pre-travel variation or triggering radius variation, are used rarely. Systematic errors of the probes, linked to the differences in pre-travel values for different measurement directions, can be corrected or compensated, but it is not a widely used procedure. In this paper, the share of systematic errors and random errors in total error of exemplary probes are determined. In the case of simple, kinematic probes, systematic errors are much greater than random errors, so compensation would significantly reduce the probing error. Moreover, it shows that in the case of kinematic probes commonly specified unidirectional repeatability is significantly better than 2D performance. However, in the case of more precise strain-gauge probe systematic errors are of the same order as random errors, which means that errors correction or compensation, in this case, would not yield any significant benefits.},

ABSTRACT = {The metal 3-D printing market is currently dominated by high-end applications, which make it inaccessible for small and medium enterprises, fab labs, and individual makers who are interested in the ability to prototype and additively manufacture final products in metal. Recent progress led to low-cost open-source metal 3-D printers using a gas metal arc welding (GMAW)-based print head. This reduced the cost of metal 3-D printers into the range of desktop prosumer polymer 3-D printers. Consequent research established good material properties of metal 3-D printed parts with readily-available weld filler wire, reusable substrates, thermal and stress properties, toolpath planning, bead-width control, mechanical properties, and support for overhangs. These previous works showed that GMAW-based metal 3-D printing has a good adhesion between layers and is not porous inside the printed parts, but they did not proceed far enough to demonstrate applications. In this study, the utility of the GMAW approach to 3-D printing is investigated using a low-cost open-source metal 3-D printer and a converted Computer Numerical Control router machine to make useful parts over a range of applications including: fixing an existing part by adding a 3-D metal feature, creating a product using the substrate as part of the component, 3-D printing in high resolution of useful objects, near net objects, and making an integrated product using a combination of steel and polymer 3-D printing. The results show that GMAW-based 3-D printing is capable of distributed manufacturing of useful products for a wide variety of applications for sustainable development.},

ABSTRACT = {In a production of filigree and complex geometries, different NC-controlled processes such as laser cutting, EDM milling, and micromachining require a constant feed rate to ensure high-quality manufacturing results. Due to the technically limited acceleration ability of the machine tool axes, the nominal feed cannot always be achieved. This in particular is the case when the machine tool has to perform a significant change of direction in corners. In this paper, the impact of too low feed rates on the process of precise micromilling of a hardened high-speed steel AISI (M3:2) 63 ± 1 HRC) is discussed. An unattained feed rate leads to a ploughing dominated process with a high burr formation resulting in a huge potential loss of micromilling processes. Furthermore, a simulation approach is presented which allows the prediction of the actually achieved feed rate. The developed machine model provides a reliable method to identify critical areas in the entire NC program.},

ABSTRACT = {During the process of grind-hardening, the dissipated heat from the process is utilized for a surface layer hardening of machined components made of steel. A martensitic phase transformation occurs within the affected subsurface regions and compressive residual stresses are induced. However, the layout of a grind-hardening process for given hardness results (material modification) is very difficult. Thus, a series of extensive experimental tests is required. To reduce this experimental effort, the newly developed concept of Process Signatures is used to describe the material modifications based on the thermal load appearing during the grind-hardening process. Based on an analytical calculation of the temperature fields during the grind-hardening process (surface- and external-cylindrical-grind-hardening), the internal thermal load was characterized by the maximum contact zone temperature and the maximum temperature gradient at the surface and was correlated with the process quantities (heat flux to the workpiece and the contact time). Metallographic investigations were used to analyze the surface hardening depth and the hardness change at the surface, which were correlated with the quantities describing the internal material loads. The results show that the surface hardening depth was mainly governed by the maximum contact zone temperature and the maximum temperature gradient at the surface, whereas the hardness change at the surface was influenced additionally by the quenching time.},

ABSTRACT = {An S-shaped machining test is proposed for the ISO 10791-7 standard to verify the performance of five-axis machining centers. However, investigation of the factor that has the most influence on the geometrical accuracy of finished S-shaped workpieces has not been undertaken. Determination of the influence of NC program tolerance and geometric errors concerning the rotary axes on the accuracy of the finished S-shaped workpiece forms the main objective of the study. Actual cutting experiments as well as simulations were performed during the proposed investigation. Our results clarify that NC-program tolerance has a significant influence on the end quality of the machined surface. Although geometric errors pertaining to rotary axes also have a significant influence on machined-surface quality, it is difficult to evaluate the influence of each individual error, because all geometric errors make glitches at the same point on the machined surface. The proposed S-shaped machining test can be used to provide a complete demonstration of available machining techniques.},

ABSTRACT = {Due to the constant need for better functionalized surfaces or smaller, function integrated components, precise and efficient manufacturing processes have to be established. Micro milling with micro end mills is one of the most promising processes for this task as it combines a high geometric flexibility in a wide range of machinable materials with low set-up costs. A downside of this process is the wear of the micro end mills. Due to size effects and the relatively low cutting speed, the cutting edge is especially subjected to massive abrasive wear. One possibility to minimize this wear is coating of micro end mills. This research paper describes the performance of eight different hard coatings for micro end mills with a diameter <40 µm and discusses some properties for the best performing coating type. With this research, it is therefore possible to boost the possibilities of micro milling for the manufacture of next generation products.},

ABSTRACT = {To be competitive in a manufacturing environment by providing optimal performance in terms of cost-effectiveness and swiftness of system changes, there is a need for flexible production systems based on a well-defined strategy. Companies are steadily looking for methodology to evaluate, improve and update the performance of manufacturing systems for processing operations. Implementation of an adequate strategy for these systems’ flexibility requires a deep understanding of the intricate interactions between the machining process parameters and the manufacturing system’s operational parameters. This paper proposes a framework/generic model for one of the most common metal cutting operations—the boring process of an engine block machining system. A system dynamics modelling approach is presented for modelling the structure of machining system parameters of the boring process, key performance parameters and their intrinsic relationships. The model is based on a case study performed in a company manufacturing engine blocks for heavy vehicles. The approach could allow for performance evaluation of an engine block manufacturing system condition. The presented model enables a basis for other similar processes and industries producing discrete parts.},

ABSTRACT = {Additive manufacturing (AM) of soft materials has a wide variety of applications, such as customized or wearable devices. Silicone is one popular material for these applications given its favorable material properties. However, AM of silicone parts with overhang structures remains challenging due to the soft nature of the material. Overhang structures are the areas where there is no underlying structure. Typically, a support material is used and built in the underlying space so that the overhang structures can be built upon it. Currently, there is no support structure that has been used for AM of silicone. The goal of this study is to develop an AM process to fabricate silicone parts with overhang structures. We first identified and confirmed poly-vinyl alcohol (PVA), a water-soluble material, as a suitable support material for silicone by evaluating the adhesion strength between silicone and PVA. Process parameters for the support material, including critical overhang angle and minimum infill density for the support material, are identified. However, overhang angle alone is not the only determining factor for support material. As silicone is a soft material, it deflects due to its own weight when the height of the overhang structure increases. A finite element model is developed to estimate the critical overhang height paired with different overhang angles to determine whether the use of support material is needed. Finally, parts with overhang structures are printed to demonstrate the capability of the developed process.},

ABSTRACT = {A class of linear polarization conversion coding metasurfaces (MSs) based on a metal cut-wire structure is proposed, which can be applied to the reduction properties of radar cross section (RCS). We firstly present a hypothesis based on the principle of planar array theory, and then verify the RCS reduction characteristics using linear polarization conversion coding MSs by simulations and experiments. The simulated results show that in the frequency range of 6–14 GHz, the linear polarization conversion ratio reaches a maximum value of 90%, which is in good agreement with the theoretical predictions. For normal incident x- and y-polarized waves, RCS reduction of designed coding MSs 01/01 and 01/10 is essentially more than 10 dB in the above-mentioned frequency range. We prepare and measure the 01/10 coding MS sample, and find that the experimental results in terms of reflectance and RCS reduction are in good agreement with the simulated ones under normal incidence. In addition, under oblique incidence, RCS reduction is suppressed as the angle of incidence increases, but still exhibits RCS reduction effects in a certain frequency range. The designed MS is expected to have valuable potential in applications for stealth field technology.},

ABSTRACT = {The fabrication of engineered lattice structures has recently gained momentum due to the development of novel additive manufacturing techniques. Interest in lattice structures resides not only in the possibility of obtaining efficient lightweight materials, but also in the functionality of pre-designed architectured structures for specific applications, such as biomimetic implants, chemical catalyzers, and heat transfer devices. The mechanical behaviour of lattice structures depends not only the composition of the base material, but also on the type and size of the unit cells, as well as on the material microstructure resulting from a specific fabrication procedure. The present work focuses on the static and fatigue behavior of diamond cell lattice structures fabricated from an AlSiMg alloy by laser powder bed fusion technology. In particular, the specimens were fabricated with three different orientations of lattice cells—[001], [011], [111]—and subjected to static tensile testing and force-controlled pull–pull fatigue testing up to 1 × 107 cycles. In parallel, the mechanical behavior of dense tensile plain and notched specimens was also studied and compared to that of their lattice counterparts. Results showed a significant effect of the cell orientation on the fatigue lives: specimens oriented at [001] were ~30% more fatigue-resistant than specimens oriented at [011] and [111].},

ABSTRACT = {The correct choice of process parameters is important in predicting the cut surface and obtaining a fully-fine sheared surface in the fine blanking process. The researchers used the value of the critical fracture criterion obtained by long duration experiments to predict the conditions of cut surfaces in the fine blanking process. In this study, the clearance-dependent critical ductile fracture criteria obtained by the Cockcroft-Latham and Oyane criteria were used to reduce the time and cost of experiments to obtain the value of the critical fracture criterion. The Finite Element Method (FEM) was applied to fine blanking processes to study the influences of process parameters such as the initial compression, the punch and die corner radii and the shape and size of the V-ring indenter on the length of the sheared surface. The effects of stress triaxiality and punch diameters on the cut surface produced by the fine blanking process are also discussed. The verified process parameters and tool geometry for obtaining a fully-fine sheared SPCC surface are described. The results showed that the accurate and stable prediction of ductile fracture initiation can be achieved using the Oyane criterion.},

ABSTRACT = {High-speed machining (HSM) is used in industry to improve the productivity and quality of the cutting operations. In this investigation, pure alumina ceramics with the addition of ZrO2, and mixed alumina (Al2O3 + TiC) tools were used in the dry hard turning of AISI 4340 (52 HRC) at different high cutting speeds of 150, 250, 700 and 1000 m/min. It was observed that at cutting speeds of 150 and 250 m/min, pure alumina ceramic tools had better wear resistance than mixed alumina ones. However, upon increasing the cutting speed from 700 to 1000 m/min, mixed alumina ceramic tools outperformed pure ceramic ones. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were used to investigate the worn cutting edges and analyze the obtained results. It was found that the tribo-films formed at the cutting zone during machining affected the wear resistances of the tools and influenced the coefficient of friction at the tool-chip interface. These observations were confirmed by the chip compression ratio results at different cutting conditions. Raising cutting speed to 1000 m/min corresponded to a remarkable decrease in cutting force components in the dry hard turning of AISI 4340 steel.},

ABSTRACT = {Smart ceramic materials are next generation materials with the inherent intelligence to adapt to change in the external environment. These materials are destined to play an essential role in several critical engineering applications. Machining these materials using traditional machining processes is a challenge. The laser beam micromachining (LBMM) process has the potential to machine such smart materials. However, laser machining when performed in air induces high thermal stress on the surface, often leading to crack formation, recast and re-deposition of ablated material, and large heat-affected zones (HAZ). Performing laser beam machining in the presence of a liquid medium could potentially resolve these issues. This research investigates the possibility of using a Liquid Assisted—Laser Beam Micromachining (LA-LBMM) process for micromachining smart ceramic materials. Experimental studies are performed to compare the machining quality of laser beam machining process in air and in a liquid medium. The study reveals that the presence of liquid medium helps in controlling the heat-affected zone and the taper angle of the cavity drilled, thereby enhancing the machining quality. Analytical modeling is developed for the prediction of HAZ and cavity diameter both in air and underwater conditions, and the model is capable of predicting the experimental results to within 10% error.},

ABSTRACT = {There has been a substantial increase in the use and development of plastics over the last century. However, due to ever-diminishing petroleum feedstocks and growing concern for the environment, there has been a rise in the use of eco-friendly polymers affording similar properties to that of their depleting counterparts. Poly(ε-caprolactone) is one such polymer. This present study investigates the possibility of developing a degradable nanocomposite, suitable for fused filament fabrication, utilizing hot melt extrusion technology to blend poly(ε-caprolactone), poly(ethylene) oxide and the nanoclay halloysite at loadings of two and six weight percent. The extruded blends were characterized using common polymer testing techniques. The addition of poly(ε-caprolactone) to the poly(ethylene) oxide matrix provided a plasticizing effect which was apparent with the melt flow index and melting point of the blends reducing with an increase in poly(ε-caprolactone) content. Upon reinforcing the matrix with halloysite, there was a significant improvement in mechanical properties. The addition of halloysite significantly increased Young’s modulus 11% and 25% when the loading was two and six percent respectively. Furthermore, it was also possible to produce a filament with the desired properties, diameter 1.75 mm, for fused filament fabrication, with subsequent studies required to evaluate their printability.},

ABSTRACT = {In this work, the microstructure, texture, phases, and microhardness of 45° printed (with respect to the build direction) homogenized, and hot isostatically pressed (HIP) cylindrical IN718 specimens are investigated. Phase morphology, grain size, microhardness, and crystallographic texture at the bottom of each specimen differ from those of the top due to changes in cooling rate. High cooling rates during the printing process generated a columnar grain structure parallel to the building direction in the as-printed condition with a texture transition from (001) orientation at the bottom of the specimen to (111) orientation towards the specimen top based on EBSD analysis. A mixed columnar and equiaxed grain structure associated with about a 15% reduction in texture is achieved after homogenization treatment. HIP treatment caused significant grain coarsening, and engendered equiaxed grains with an average diameter of 154.8 µm. These treatments promoted the growth of δ-phase (Ni3Nb) and MC-type brittle (Ti, Nb)C carbides at grain boundaries. Laves phase (Fe2Nb) was also observed in the as-printed and homogenized specimens. Ostwald ripening of (Ti, Nb)C carbides caused excessive grain growth at the bottom of the HIPed IN718 specimens, while smaller grains were observed at their top. Microhardness in the as-fabricated specimens was 236.9 HV and increased in the homogenized specimens by 19.3% to 282.6 HV due to more even distribution of secondary precipitates, and the nucleation of smaller grains. A 36.1% reduction in microhardness to 180.5 HV was found in the HIPed condition due to   γ ″ phase dissolution and differences in grain morphology.},

ABSTRACT = {This experimental study focuses on various cooling strategies and lubrication-assisted cooling strategies to improve machining performance in the turning process of AISI 4140 steel. Liquid nitrogen (LN2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) were used as cryogenic coolants, and their performances were compared with respect to progression of tool wear. Minimum quantity lubrication (MQL) was also used with carbon dioxide. Progression of wear, including flank and nose, are the main outputs examined during experimental study. This study illustrates that carbon dioxide-assisted cryogenic machining alone and with minimum quantity lubrication does not contribute to decreasing the progression of wear within selected cutting conditions. This study also showed that carbon dioxide-assisted cryogenic machining helps to increase chip breakability. Liquid nitrogen-assisted cryogenic machining results in a reduction of tool wear, including flank and nose wear, in the machining process of AISI 4140 steel material. It was also observed that in the machining process of this material at a cutting speed of 80 m/min, built-up edges occurred in both cryogenic cooling conditions. Additionally, chip flow damage occurs in particularly dry machining.},

ABSTRACT = {Magnesium silicate hydrate (MSH) gel was formed by reacting magnesium oxide (MgO) with silica fume (SF) in distilled water.

The MSH characterization has been carried out using a range of analytical techniques. Quantitative analysis was achieved using thermogravimetric analysis (TG/DTG) with a de-convolution technology. The structure of MSH gel was characterized using solid state nuclear magnetic resonance (29Si NMR) and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to investigate MSH microstructure. Compared with natural magnesium silicate hydrate minerals, the structure of MSH gel is highly disordered and generates on the surface of particles, producing a shell structure with cavity. The molecular structure of MSH phase is layered. The results also show that the extent of polymerization of MSH gel is related to the solution pH during hydration.},

ABSTRACT = {Many different process chains are possible to manufacture profiled grooves in turbine discs. Broaching with high speed steel tools is still state of the art today but as a consequence of the rising demand for aero engines, the disc manufacturers are striving for alternative high performance processes to increase both flexibility and productivity in the manufacturing of these safety critical features. Broaching machines are oftentimes at a bottleneck in the production of rotating turbine discs. Several other machining processes have been discussed in the context of slotting, such as broaching with carbide tools, milling, water jet machining, W-EDM and grinding. Within this paper a multi-criteria assessment approach is presented dealing with slotting processes. The assessment comprehends economical, ecological, flexibility and productivity criteria, and is based on data gathered with an aero engine OEM. The technological aspects such as tool life and productivities are based on real machining tests that have been carried out within the project HoFePro. The assessment is conducted for multiple profile shapes that represent different sizes and geometrical complexities of profiled grooves. The manufacturing processes within the assessment include broaching with HSS and carbide, milling with ceramics and carbide (side and end) as well as profile milling with carbide tools. The underlying workpiece material is a nickel-based alloy.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, water quenching of large ingots was simulated using FORGE NxT 1.1® Finite Element code. Simulations were carried out for as-forged medium-carbon low-alloy steel. A novel method is proposed to simulate the different parts of a large size forged block with different chemical compositions and grain sizes using the multiple materials method. The effects of macrosegregation, grain size variation and cooling rate on phase distribution through the volume of the forged block were investigated. The delay in transformation kinetics, which is due to the effect of grain size variation and carbon content, was analyzed. Results show that macrosegregation and grain size variations significantly influence transformation start points and the volume fraction of phases that are present in each location of the forged ingot. The proposed prediction method was validated using high-resolution dilatometry experiments and X-ray diffraction measurements to evaluate accurately the volume fraction of martensite, bainite and the percentage of retained austenite for each condition.},

ABSTRACT = {This research work aims at finding the optimum process parameters for the laser welding of AA7020 aluminium alloys. The use of 7xxx series alloys is limited because of weldability problems, such as hot cracking, porosity, and softening of the fusion zone despite its higher specific strength-to-weight ratio. AA7020 aluminium alloy was welded while varying the process parameters so as to obtain optimal welding efficiency. The welded samples were analysed to reveal the microstructure, defects, and mechanical properties of the welded zone. The samples were prepared from a plate of AA7020, which was hot rolled at a temperature of 470 °С to a thickness of 1 mm. The welding was carried out at an overlap of 0.25 mm, duration of 14 ms and argon shield gas flow rate of 15 L/min. Process parameters, such as peak power, welding speed, and pulse shaping, were varied. The samples were welded with Al-5Ti-B and Al-5Mg as filler metals. The welding speed, peak power, and pulse shaping have a great influence on the weldability and hot cracking susceptibility of the aluminium alloy. Al-5Ti-B improves the microstructure and ultimate tensile strength of AA7020 aluminium alloy.},

ABSTRACT = {The traditional analytical cutting force prediction method for ball-end milling ignores the effect of the inclination angle on cutting forces. In this paper, a new experimental method for cutting force prediction methods considering the inclination angle in the ball-end milling process is proposed. First, the actual immersion ranges of cutter in the ball-end milling process with and without an inclination angle are analyzed by a geometrical method and the cutting force prediction model with an inclination angle is developed by a numerical integration method. Second, considering that entry and exit angles of cutting zones for different cutter layers vary due to the inclination angle, a milling force coefficients identification approach for different cutter layers is established by experimental calibration. Comparing the traditional analytical cutting force prediction method that ignores the inclination angle, the numerical simulation results show that the prediction force values calculated by the proposed method have a better consistency with the measured values.},

ABSTRACT = {Among additive manufacturing (AM) techniques, Selective Laser Melting (SLM) is widely used to fabricate metal components, including biocompatible bone implants made of 316L stainless steel. However, an issue with the components manufactured using this technique is the surface quality, which is generally beyond the acceptable range. Thus, hybrid manufacturing, including AM and finish machining processes, are being developed and implemented in the industry. Machining processes, particularly finish machining, are needed to improve surface quality of additively manufactured components and performance. This study focuses on the finish machining process of additively manufactured 316L stainless steel parts. Finish machining tests were carried out under dry conditions for various cutting speeds and feed rates. The experimental study reveals that finish machining resulted in up to 88% lower surface roughness of SLMed 316L stainless steel; it also had a substantial effect on microstructure and microhardness of the additively manufactured components by creating smaller grains and strain-hardened layer on the surface and subsurface of the SLMed part. The finish machining process also significantly decreased the density of porosity on the surface and subsurface, compared to an as-built sample. The created strain harden layer with less porosity is expected to increases wear and fatigue resistance of these parts.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper presents an original method of predicting temperature distribution in orthogonal machining based on a constitutive model of various materials and the mechanics of their cutting process. Currently, temperature distribution is commonly investigated using arduous experiments, computationally inefficient numerical analyses, and complex analytical models. In the method proposed herein, the average temperatures at the primary shear zone (PSZ) and the secondary shear zone (SSZ) were determined for various materials, based on a constitutive model and a chip-formation model using measurements of cutting force and chip thickness. The temperatures were determined when differences between predicted shear stresses using the Johnson–Cook constitutive model (J–C model) and those using a chip-formation model were minimal. J–C model constants from split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) tests were adopted from the literature. Cutting conditions, experimental cutting force, and chip thickness were used to predict the shear stresses. The temperature predictions were compared to documented results in the literature for AISI 1045 steel and Al 6082-T6 aluminum in multiple tests in an effort to validate this methodology. Good agreement was observed for the tests with each material. Thanks to the reliable and easily measurable cutting forces and chip thicknesses, and the simple forms of the employed models, the presented methodology has less experimental complexity, less mathematical complexity, and high computational efficiency.},

ABSTRACT = {The production of fibre metal laminates (FMLs) is a time consuming and expensive procedure. This paper shows the application of the vacuum assisted resin transfer moulding ((VA)RTM) technique using an injection unit and a rigid mould for the production of FMLs. This processing technique, in combination with a corona discharge activation of the aluminium surface, can lead to enormous reductions to the cycle time. To prove the quality of the produced FML, impact tests were carried out. The influence of the impact energy on the specimen is observed using a deformation scan and ultrasound C-Scan. Furthermore, the peak forces and permanent deflections of the tested specimen were analysed.},

ABSTRACT = {In recent years, titanium and nickel alloys have become relevant in the production of aeronautic and astronautic parts. Since both nickel and titanium alloys have a very small thermal conductivity, the used tool will suffer huge damage from the heat generated during a grinding process. Therefore, there is a requirement for a durable tool with excellent cooling capacity. In this research, a new forced cooling technology that uses high-pressure coolant for machining difficult-to-machine materials was developed and evaluated. Here, a through hole on the rake face near the turning tool tip was machined by electrical discharge machining. Then, high-pressure coolant was supplied to the turning tool from the machined hole. Several values of pressure were experimentally performed. It is concluded from the results that the technology could effectively cool the area near the tip of a turning tool, and that the chip was also effectively removed by the high-pressure coolant.},

ABSTRACT = {To investigate the effect of ball mill treatment of microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) on the rheological properties of MCC-polymer suspension, the structure and physicochemical characteristics of ground samples with different milling time and the rheological behaviors of MCC-starch suspensions were determined and comprehensively analyzed. During the ball milling process, MCC underwent a morphological transformation from rod-like to spherical shape under the combined effect of breakage and an agglomeration regime. The particle size and crystallinity index of MCC exhibited an exponential declining trend with ball milling time. All of the milled MCC samples presented a crystalline cellulose Iβ structure whereas the MCC mechanically treated in a shorter time had better thermal stability. Rheological measurements of starch/MCC suspensions indicated that all the blended paste exhibited shear thinning behavior and ‘weak’ elastic gel-like viscoelastic properties over the whole investigated range owing to the formation of entangled network structure. The rheological behavior of starch/MCC pastes was strongly dependent on milling time and concentration of MCC samples. The increase in milling time of MCC samples resulted in the loss of rheological properties of starch/MCC pastes, where the size of the MCC playing a dominant role in affecting the properties of composite suspension. In addition, a possible network within starch/MCC suspensions was proposed.},

ABSTRACT = {The additive manufacturing (AM) of aluminum alloys promises to considerably enhance the performance of lightweight critical parts in various industrial applications. AlSi10Mg is one of the compatible Al alloys used in the selective laser melting of lightweight components. However, the surface defects obtained from the as-built parts affect their mechanical properties, and thus represent an obstacle to using them as final products. This study aims to improve the surface characteristics of the as-built AlSi10Mg parts using shot peening (SP). To achieve this goal, different SP intensities were applied to various surface textures of the as-built samples. The SP results showed a significant improvement in the as-built surface topography and a higher value of effective depth using 22.9 A intensity and Gp165 glass beads. The area near the shot-peened surface showed a significant microstructure refinement to a specific depth due to the dynamic precipitation of nanoscale Si particles. Surface hardening was also detected and high compressive residual stresses were generated due to severe plastic deformation. The surface characteristics obtained after SP could result in a significant improvement in the mechanical properties and fatigue strength, and thus promise performance enhancement for critical parts in various industrial applications.},

ABSTRACT = {In order to improve the finishing efficiency of traditional plane magnetic abrasive finishing (MAF), we have previously proposed an effective plane MAF process combined with an electrolytic process and developed a special compound machining tool for the electrolytic magnetic abrasive finishing (EMAF). In this research, the EMAF process is divided into two finishing steps. The first finishing step is the EMAF step, and a single MAF step constitutes the second finishing step. The machinability of SUS304 material can be improved through the formation of passive films from the electrolytic process in the EMAF step. Meanwhile, the passive films can be rapidly and easily removed by friction between the magnetic particles and the workpiece-generated mechanical machining force. Thus, the surface finishing efficiency can be greatly improved. Compared with a dedicated MAF machining tool or a dedicated electrolytic machining tool, this special compound machining tool can synchronously achieve MAF and electrolytic processes to make the processing more convenient. This study focuses on exploring mechanical finishing characteristics of the special compound machining tool through MAF experiments. Additionally, EMAF experiments are conducted under the optimal mechanical finishing conditions. The experimental results of the EMAF process show that the surface roughness Ra can be reduced to less than 30 nm at the 4-min EMAF step, and it can be further reduced to 20 nm at the 10-min MAF step.},

ABSTRACT = {A 3D printer was developed for the 3D printing of cellulose hydrogels using open source software and simple 3D printer hardware. Using a temperature-based sol-gel transition of cellulose dissolved in aqueous solutions of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and urea, a three-dimensional gel can be created by moving a focused laser beam across a bath of the cellulose solution and lowering the print stage after every layer. A line width of 100–150 µm and layer thickness of 25 µm of the printed part could be achieved. No delamination between printed layers occurred and no additional support material was needed to create free hanging structures due to suspending the printed part in printing liquid. By adding cellulose powder to the solution, the gelation temperature, the gel strength and stiffness can be manipulated while maintaining a high internal porosity of the gel. A laser power of 100 mW was found to produce the highest quality print with an accurate representation of the previously designed part. Lower power settings (80 mW) produced insufficient gelation and as a result reduced print accuracy while higher power settings (120 mW) caused the gel to burn.},

ABSTRACT = {The drilling of carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) plate is very critical in its structural applications in aeronautical, aerospace, and automobile industries. For ensuring the good quality of drilled holes in terms of least drilling damage and prolonged tool life, suitable selection of drill geometry and material, and drilling parameters—such as cutting speed and feed rate—are imperative in the drilling of CFRP plate. This study aims to evaluate the cutting performance of conventional two-flute twist drills made of cemented tungsten carbide YG6X (WC-6 wt % Co) for the dry drilling of the multidirectional T700 CFRP plate. The effects of varying cutting speed and tool wear pattern on the drilling performance are analyzed. The drilling performance is assessed in terms of hole quality by the qualitative and quantitative analysis of drilling-induced delamination and hole diameter. Furthermore, the correlation between the tool wear progression and the drilled hole quality is established. Through this assessment, a suitable set of drilling parameters, i.e., cutting speed of 9000 rpm and feed rate of 400 mm/min, is proposed for producing the best quality holes for multidirectional T700 CFRP plate.},

ABSTRACT = {Laser surface heating allows for the thermal treating of clearly defined surface areas thanks to the ability to focus the laser beam to a specific point. Thus, the rapid heating and subsequent rapid cooling when the beam is moved away, typically associated with laser light, is used as an in-machine process to improve the machinability of hard- or difficult-to-machine alloys. In laser-assisted machining (LAM), laser irradiation occurs simultaneously with materials removal; however, it is difficult to ensure a complete removal of the irradiated areas. In the present work, the two processes were decoupled to investigate the interaction effects of laser radiation type 316L. The surface residual stress, hardness, and microstructure of milled flat specimens were measured prior to and after diode-generated laser beam irradiation. Laser exposure of samples was conducted under protective gas shielding (Argon) using heating parameter combinations that would limit or avoid laser surface melting. Conversely, when the surface underwent melting, the formation of a fast solidification layer resulted in the removal of the cold-worked effect and the significant softening of the surface layers. Beam power density in-homogeneities and incomplete machining of the treated areas in LAM have the potential to introduce significant undesired changes on components’ surface integrity.},

ABSTRACT = {Reliable machining of carbon fiber-reinforced plastics (CFRP) is the key for application of these lightweight materials. Due to its anisotropy, CFRP is a very difficult material to machine because of occurring delamination and fiber-pullouts. The tool design is especially crucial to minimize and to avoid these processing errors. In this paper a process analysis for drilling is shown for better understanding of the chip formation. Drilling of unidirectional CFRP enables the investigation of the effect of fiber orientation on the chip formation process. In theory, the amount of cut fibers and the cutting angle to the main cutting edge determine the cutting force. Experimental tests with varied macroscopic drill geometries verify this theory. Based on these detected relationships, the tool loads can be calculated for a successful tool design.},

ABSTRACT = {A low-cost parametric finite element thermal model is proposed to study the impact of the initial powder condition, such as diameter and packing density, on effective thermal conductivity as well as the impact of the laser power input on the final temperature distributions during selective laser melting (SLM). Stainless steel 304L is the material used, since it is not yet commercially available in SLM equipment and our main goal was to show the capabilities of the finite element method in the evaluation of power input in the process. The results from our sensitivity analysis showed that packing density has a greater impact on the final temperature distributions compared with powder diameter variance. However, overall the thermal conductivity of the powder only showed significant effects below the melting point, otherwise the thermal conductivity no longer affected the temperature distributions. Among the three different power inputs analyzed, the temperature profile demonstrated that power inputs of 100 and 200 W are recommended when printing SS-304L rather than 400 W, which generates too high temperature in the powder bed, a non-favorable behavior that can induce high residual stresses and material evaporation.},

ABSTRACT = {In this study, effects of different deformation conditions on the rolling force were studied during variable gauge rolling processes. To this end, variations of rolling forces with rolling times were analyzed at different roll diameters, absolute thickness reductions and friction coefficients. Considering the rolling force variations, an abrupt change in the outlet section of downward and outward rolling was observed at all deformation conditions. The experimental data, along with the results obtained from finite element method (FEM) simulations, revealed that this drop in the rolling force (DRF) is strongly dependent on the deformation conditions. It was found that the DRF value increases with increasing absolute thickness reduction, roll diameter and friction coefficient. Furthermore, dependency of contact length on the roll radius and wedge angle (slope of the thickness transition zone) was investigated. Accordingly, it was concluded that the variations of the DRF value can be mainly attributed to the changes in the contact length during variable gauge rolling. Moreover, slab method analysis was used to model the effects of deformation conditions on DRF.},

ABSTRACT = {The paper is the result of research intended to develop a process route for the manufacturing of powder metallurgical (PM) gears for application in transmissions units for heavy duty powertrain applications. The main problem of PM for such applications is that the generated pores that occur through conventional pressing and sintering processes reduce the gear strength, which reduces the capacity for power transmission by the gear. In prior work, removing the pores and reaching 100% density by adding Hot Iso-static Pressing (HIP) after two times pressing and two times sintering steps in the process route was suggested to solve the mentioned problem. During the investigations of this work it was revealed that the gear dimensions could influence the process results with respect to geometrical distortions. In this paper we have presented a finite element (FE) model based analysis on how the gear geometrical parameters influenced the distortions occurring in HIP. The simulation model is validated with experiments. Furthermore, the simulation model is used to create a prediction model for further investigations. The research showed that PM gears with different sizes during the proposed process route behaved differently in terms of distortions. This was illustrated with a series of simulations with different gear geometries. A regression model was developed based on the FE results for further practical predictive use. The distortions caused by HIP should be considered in the process design to prevent expensive post processes afterwards to reach the gear with accurate geometry and keep the costs of manufacturing low. It is concluded that it is possible to use the innovative process route including HIP to reach the full density and close all the open pores but not for all kind of gear geometries.},

ABSTRACT = {Difficult-to-cut materials have been widely employed in many engineering applications, including automotive and aeronautical designs because of their effective properties. However, other characteristics; for example, high hardness and low thermal conductivity has negatively affected the induced surface quality and tool life, and consequently the overall machinability of such materials. Inconel 718, is widely used in many industries including aerospace; however, the high temperature generated during machining is negatively affecting its machinability. Flood cooling is a commonly used remedy to improve machinability problems; however, government regulation has called for further alternatives to reduce the environmental and health impacts of flood cooling. This work aimed to investigate the influence of dispersed multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and aluminum oxide (Al2O3) gamma nanoparticles, on enhancing the minimum quantity lubrication (MQL) technique cooling and lubrication capabilities during turning of Inconel 718. Machining tests were conducted, the generated surfaces were examined, and the energy consumption data were recorded. The study was conducted under different design variables including cutting speed, percentage of added nano-additives (wt.%), and feed velocity. The study revealed that the nano-fluids usage, generally improved the machining performance when cutting Inconel 718. In addition, it was shown that the nanotubes additives provided better improvements than Al2O3 nanoparticles.},

ABSTRACT = {Liquid Assisted Laser Beam Micromachining (LA-LBMM) process is an advanced machining process that can overcome the limitations of traditional laser beam machining processes. This research involves the use of a Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation technique to investigate the complex and dynamic mechanisms involved in the LA-LBMM process both in static and dynamic mode. The results of the MD simulation are compared with those of Laser Beam Micromachining (LBMM) performed in air. The study revealed that machining during LA-LBMM process showed higher removal compared with LBMM process. The LA-LBMM process in dynamic mode showed lesser material removal compared with the static mode as the flowing water carrying the heat away from the machining zone. Investigation of the material removal mechanism revealed the presence of a thermal blanket and a bubble formation in the LA-LBMM process, aiding in higher material removal. The findings of this study provide further insights to strengthen the knowledge base of laser beam micromachining technology.},

ABSTRACT = {The concept of Skin Model Shape has been introduced as a method for a close representation of manufactured parts using a discrete geometry representation scheme. However, discretized surfaces make irregular polyhedra, which are computationally demanding to model and process using the traditional implicit surface and boundary representation techniques. Moreover, there are still some research challenges related to the geometrical variation modelling of manufactured products; specifically, methods for geometrical data processing, the mapping of manufacturing variation sources to a geometric model, and the improvement of variation visualization techniques. To provide steps towards addressing these challenges this work uses Octree, a 3D space partitioning technique, as an aid for geometrical data processing, variation visualization, variation modelling and propagation, and tolerance analysis. Further, Skin Model Shapes are generated either by manufacturing a simulation using a non-ideal toolpath on solid models of Skin Model Shapes that are assembled to non-ideal fixtures or from measurement data. Octrees are then used in a variation envelope extraction from the simulated or measurement data, which becomes a basis for further simulation and tolerance analysis. To illustrate the method, an industrial two-stage truck component manufacturing line was studied. Simulation results show that the predicted Skin Model Shapes closely match to the measurement data from the manufacturing line, which could also be used to map to manufacturing error sources. This approach contributes towards the application of Octrees in many Skin Model Shape related operations and processes.},

ABSTRACT = {This study proposes using the iterative learning control method to adjust the volumetric error-compensated tool path, where the working volume motion accuracy of three-axis computerized numerical control (CNC) milling machine tools is increased by segmented modification of the part program. As the three-axis CNC milling machine tools generally have volumetric error of working volume, this study refers to the measured and established table of volumetric errors and uses the method of the modifying part program for volumetric error compensation of machine tools. This study proposes using part-program single-block positioning segmented for volumetric error compensation, as the generated compensated part program with multiple compensated blocks can effectively compensate the volumetric error of working volume in the tool moving process. In terms of the compensated tool path computing method, this study uses the iterative learning control (ILC) method and refers to compensated tool path and volumetric errors along the compensated tool path for iterative computation. Finally, a part program with multiple blocks is modified by the converged optimal compensated tool path, in order that the modified part program has higher-precision volumetric error compensation effect. The simulation result shows that the rate of improvement of error of the volumetric error compensation method proposed in this study is 70%. The result of cutting tests shows that the average rate of improvement of the straightness error of the test workpiece is 60%, while the average rate of improvement of height error is 80%. Therefore, the results of simulation and cutting tests can prove the feasibility of using the ILC method for segmented modification of the volumetric error-compensated part programs proposed in this study.},

ABSTRACT = {Laser chemical machining (LCM) is a non-conventional processing method that enables a smooth and precise micro structuring of metallic surfaces. However, a high-quality removal is limited to a laser power window of some 100 mW. This is due to the high sensibility to removal disturbances, such as the deposition of metallic salts and oxides. In this work, the dynamic process behavior around the transition from a disturbance-free to a disturbed removal is investigated for the laser chemical machining of titanium (3.7024) and stainless steel (AISI 304) in different phosphoric acid solutions. Therefore, the removal cavities are recorded using confocal scanning microscopy and characterized regarding width, depth and quality in dependence of the laser power, feed velocity and electrolyte concentration. While the removal characteristics within the disturbance-free regime are found to be material-independent, the disturbed regime is strongly dependent on the tendency of the material to gas bubble adherence. Additional CCD records of the interaction zone reveal that the transition to the disturbed regime is accompanied by significant light reflections and thereby indicate the influence of adhering gas bubbles on disturbing the removal process. Moreover, typical removal disturbances are presented and discussed with regard to the responsible mechanisms for their occurrence.},

ABSTRACT = {Laser Cladding is one of the leading processes within Additive Manufacturing technologies, which has concentrated a considerable amount of effort on its development. In regard to the latter, the current study aims to summarize the influence of the most relevant process parameters in the laser cladding processing of single and compound volumes (solid forms) made from AISI 316L stainless steel powders and using a coaxial nozzle for their deposition. Process speed, applied laser power and powder flow are considered to be the main variables affecting the laser cladding in single clads, whereas overlap percentage and overlapping strategy also become relevant when dealing with multiple clads. By setting appropriate values for each process parameter, the main goal of this paper is to develop a processing window in which a good metallurgical bond between the delivered powder and the substrate is obtained, trying simultaneously to maintain processing times at their lowest value possible. Conventional metallography techniques were performed on the cross sections of the laser tracks to measure the effective dimensions of clads, height and width, as well as the resulting dilution value. Besides the influence of the overlap between contiguous clads and layers, physical defects such as porosity and cracks were also evaluated. Optimum process parameters to maximize productivity were defined as 13 mm/s, 2500 W, 30% of overlap and a 25 g/min powder feed rate.},

ABSTRACT = {Laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) is one of the most potent additive manufacturing (AM) processes. Metallic LPBF is gaining popularity, but one of the obstacles facing its larger industrial use is the limited knowledge of its dimensional and geometrical performances. This paper presents a metrological investigation of the geometrical and dimensional deviations of a selected LPBF-manufactured component, according to the ASME Y14.5-2009 standard. This approach allows for an estimation of both the process capability, as per ISO 22514-4 standard, and the correlations between the part location in the manufacturing chamber and the profile deviations. Forty-nine parts, which are representative of a typical aerospace tooling component (30 mm in diameter and 27.2 mm in height) were manufactured from AlSi10Mg powder using an EOSINT M280 printer and subjected to a stress relief annealing at 300 °C for two hours. This manufacturing procedure was repeated three times. A complete statistical analysis was carried out and the results of the investigation show that LPBF performances for all geometrical variations of 147 identical parts fall within a range of 230 µm at a 99.73% level.},

ABSTRACT = {Poly-crystalline diamond (PCD) is an extremely tough, synthetically produced cutting tool material, which offers outstanding capabilities concerning wear behavior in abrasive cutting environments. Currently, the primary application of PCD cutting tools is the machining of non-ferrous materials, as the diamond’s carbon high affinity towards iron causes diffusion effects while cutting steel with rising temperature. This effect significantly reduces tool life. To lower the occurring temperature of the cutting process, and therefore avoid the reaction of carbon and iron, a thermal functionalization of the cutting inserts has been investigated. The results give insight into making PCD cutting tools economically usable for the machining of iron-carbon materials.},

ABSTRACT = {Transient liquid phase (TLP) bonding of 6063 aluminum alloy (Al-6063) and duplex alloy 2304 stainless steel (UNS S32304) was performed using copper foil as an interlayer between the base metals. A compression load was applied normal to the specimens. Metallurgical examination of the produced joints showed three distinct regions including a reaction zone, diffusion affected zone, and the base metals. The diffusion of copper into aluminum resulted in an Al–Cu eutectic structure. However, the oxide layer on the aluminum surface controlled the dissolution behavior of copper and the extent of its wettability with the base metals. Although voids and intermetallic compounds were detected at the interfaces of the processed joints, a defect free joint was produced at 570 °C. In addition, the results from corrosion tests showed that the use of copper as an interlayer decreased the corrosion resistance of the joints. However, increase in thickness of the joining reaction zone with increasing bonding temperature was observed to increase corrosion resistance.},

ABSTRACT = {The geometrical accuracy of multi-pass sheet metal spinning products is crucial in many applications. Aerospace, petroleum, and chemical industries motivated the development of modern spun components of complicated shapes with special functionality, but a substantial research lag exists behind this progress. Due to the localized plastic deformation involved, careful control of dimensions and form is required in spinning procedures. In this study, two sets of experiments were implemented for cup manufacturing using a retrofitted computer numerically controlled (CNC) spinning machine to identify the critical factors affecting product geometry and reveal their influence on the shape accuracy of the spun cups. The first set is a screening experiment to determine the most significant parameters and the second provides the optimum processing conditions affecting cup quality. The feed ratio, number of spin-forming passes, spinning ratio, and lubrication were found to have the most important effect on the geometry of the spun cups. Optimum quality with a higher processing speed (productivity) was achieved under a lubricated condition using a larger number of spin-forming passes at a high feed ratio, diminishing the commonly adopted rule of slow spinning for accurate products and reflecting a significance for state-of-the-art spinning practice. The findings of this paper introduce a basis for a spinning quality database.},

ABSTRACT = {Volumetric errors (VE) are related to the machine tool accuracy state. Extracting features from the complex VE data provides with a means to characterize this data. VE feature classification can reveal the machine tool accuracy states. This paper presents a study on how to use principal component analysis (PCA) to extract the features of VE and how to use the K-means method for machine tool accuracy state classification. The proposed data processing methods have been tested with the VE data acquired from a five-axis machine tool with different states of malfunction. The results indicate that the PCA and K-means are capable of extracting the VE feature information and classifying the fault states including the C axis encoder fault, uncalibrated C axis encoder fault, and pallet location fault from the machine tool normal states. This research provides a new way for VE features extraction and classification.},

ABSTRACT = {The ability to produce consistent material properties across a single or series of platforms, particularly over time, is the major objective in metal additive manufacturing (MAM) research. If this can be achieved, it will result in widespread adoption of the technology for industry and place it into mainstream manufacturing. However, before this can happen, it is critical to develop an understanding of how processing parameters influence the thermal conditions which dictate the mechanical properties of MAM builds. Research work reported in the literature of MAM is generally based on a set of parameters and/or the review of a few parameter changes, and observing the effects that these changes (i.e., microstructure, mechanical properties) have. While these articles provide results with some insight, there lacks a standard approach that can be used to allow meaningful comparisons and conclusions to be made concerning the optimization of the processing variables. This study provides a template which can be used for making comparisons across DED platforms. The tests are performed with a design of experiments (DOE) philosophy directed to evaluate the effect of selected parameters on the measured properties of the DED builds. Specifically, a laser engineering net shaping system (LENS) is used to build multilayered 316L coupons and analyze how build parameters such as laser power, travel speed, and powder feed rate influence the thermal conditions that will define both microstructure and microhardness. A fundamental conclusion of this research is that it is possible to repeatedly obtain a consistent microstructure that contains a fine cellular substructure with a low level of porosity (less than 1.1%) and with microhardness that is equal to or better than wrought 316L. This is mainly achieved by maintaining an associated powder flow to travel speed ratio at the power level, ensuring an appropriate net heat input for the build process.},

ABSTRACT = {A physics-based analytical model is proposed in order to predict the temperature profile during metal additive manufacturing (AM) processes, by considering the effects of temperature history in each layer, temperature-sensitivity of material properties and latent heat. The moving heat source analysis is used in order to predict the temperature distribution inside a semi-infinite solid material. The laser thermal energy deposited into a control volume is absorbed by the material thermodynamic latent heat and conducted through the contacting solid boundaries. The analytical model takes in to account the typical multi-layer aspect of additive manufacturing processes for the first time. The modeling of the problem involving multiple layers is of great importance because the thermal interactions of successive layers affect the temperature gradients, which govern the heat transfer and thermal stress development mechanisms. The temperature profile is calculated for isotropic and homogeneous material. The proposed model can be used to predict the temperature in laser-based metal additive manufacturing configurations of either direct metal deposition or selective laser melting. A numerical analysis is also conducted to simulate the temperature profile in metal AM. These two models are compared with experimental results. The proposed model also well captured the melt pool geometry as it is compared to experimental values. In order to emphasize the importance of solving the problem considering multiple layers, the peak temperature considering the layer addition and peak temperature not considering the layer addition are compared. The results show that considering the layer addition aspect of metal additive manufacturing can help to better predict the surface temperature and melt pool geometry. An analysis is conducted to show the importance of considering the temperature sensitivity of material properties in predicting temperature. A comparison of the computational time is also provided for analytical and numerical modeling. Based on the obtained results, it appears that the proposed analytical method provides an effective and accurate method to predict the temperature in metal AM.},

ABSTRACT = {The sustainability of a manufacturing process can be measured by three main factors which impact both ecological and financial constraints. These factors are the energy required to achieve a specific job, the material utilized for the job, and the time taken to complete that job. These factors have to be quantified and analysed so that a proper manufacturing system can be designed to optimize process sustainability. For this purpose, a computer package, which utilizes life cycle inventory models has been presented for CNC (Computer Numerical Control) milling and turning processes. Based on utilization of resources and production stages, the job completion time for the turning and milling processes can be divided into process (i.e., machining), idle and basic times. As parameters are different for evaluating the process times, i.e., depth and width of cut in case of milling, initial and final diameters for turning, two different case studies are presented, one for each process. The effect of material selection on the sustainability factors has been studied for different processes. Our simulations show that highly dense and hard materials take more time in finishing the job due to low cutting speed and feed rates as compared to soft materials. In addition, face milling takes longer and consumes more power as compared to peripheral milling due to more retraction time caused by over travel distance and lower vertical transverse speeds than the horizontal transverse speed used in a peripheral retraction process.},

ABSTRACT = {The manufacturing industry aims to produce many high quality products efficiently at low cost, thereby motivating companies to use advanced manufacturing technologies. The use of high-speed machining is increasingly widespread; however, it lacks a deep-rooted knowledge base needed to facilitate implementation. In this paper, response surface methodology (RSM) has been applied to determine the optimum cutting conditions leading to minimum flank wear in high-speed dry turning on AISI 1045 steel. The mathematical models in terms of machining parameters were developed for flank wear prediction using RSM on the basis of experimental results. The high speed turning experiments were carried out with two coated carbide and a cermet inserts using AISI 1045 steel as work material at different cutting speeds and machining times. The models selected for optimization were validated through the Pareto principle. Results showed the GC4215 insert to be the most optimal option, because it did not reach the cutting tool life limit and could be used for the whole range of cutting parameters selected. To quantitatively evaluate the usefulness of the cutting tools, it was proposed the coefficient of use of the tools from the results of the contour graphs. The GC4215 insert showed 100% effectiveness, followed by the GC4225 with 98.4%, and finally, the CT5015 insert with 83%.},

ABSTRACT = {Machining grooves into the surface of pine and fir (Abies spp.) deckboards reduces undesirable checking that develops when “profiled” boards are exposed to the weather. We aim to develop improved profiles for Douglas fir, western hemlock and white spruce decking to reduce their susceptibility to checking, and understand how profile geometry influences the stresses that cause checking. We varied the width and depth of grooves in profiled deckboards, exposed deckboards to the weather, and measured checking and cupping of boards. A numerical model examined the effect of groove depth on the moisture-induced stresses in profiled spruce boards. Profiling significantly reduced checking, but increased cupping of deckboards made from all three species. Western hemlock checked more than the other two species. Profiles with narrow grooves (rib profiles) were better at restricting checking than profiles with wider grooves. A rib profile with deeper grooves developed smaller stresses than a rib profile with shallower grooves, and boards with the former profile checked less than boards with shallower grooves. We conclude that checking of profiled Douglas fir, western hemlock and white spruce decking is significantly reduced by changing profile geometry, and our results suggest the best profiles to reduce checking of all three species.},

ABSTRACT = {This article elucidates the characteristics of machining forces (an important phenomenon by which machining is studied) using three sets of bimetallic specimens made of aluminum–titanium, aluminum–cast iron, and stainless steel–mild steel. The cutting, feed, and thrust forces were recorded for different cutting conditions (i.e., different cutting speeds, feeds, and cutting directions). Possibility distributions were used to quantify the uncertainty associated with machining forces, which were helpful in identifying the optimal machining direction. In synopsis, it was found that while machining the steel-based bimetallic specimens, keeping a low feed and high cutting speed is the better option, and the machining operation can be performed in both the hard-to-soft and soft-to-hard material directions, but machining in the soft-to-hard material direction is the better option. On the other hand, very soft materials should not be used in fabricating a bimetallic part because it creates machining problems. Cutting power was estimated using the cutting and feed force signals. Manufacturers who support sustainable product development (including design, manufacturing, and assembly) can benefit from the outcomes of this study because parts/products made of dissimilar materials (or multi-material objects) are better than their mono-material counterparts in terms of sustainability (cost, weight, and CO2 footprint).},

In this work, the effect of build orientation on the microstructure and mechanical properties of Ti–6Al–4V specimens manufactured by selective laser melting (SLM) was studied. The samples built in the Z orientation showed weaker tensile strength compared to the samples built in X, and Y orientations. Samples built in X and Y orientations exhibited brittle fracture features in areas close to the substrate and ductile fracture features in the area farther from the substrate. Defects including pores, cracks, and unmelted/partially-melted powder particles contributed to lower tensile and fracture toughness properties in different orientations.},

ABSTRACT = {To fill the shortages in the knowledge of the pyrolysis and combustion properties of new and aged polyvinyl chloride (PVC) sheaths, several experiments were performed by thermogravimetric analysis (TG), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), microscale combustion calorimetry (MCC), and cone calorimetry. The results show that the onset temperature of pyrolysis for an aged sheath shifts to higher temperatures. The value of the main derivative thermogravimetric analysis (DTG) peak of an aged sheath is greater than that of a new one. The mass of the final remaining residue for an aged sheath is also greater than that of a new one. The gas that is released by an aged sheath is later but faster than that of a new one. The results also show that, when compared with a new sheath, the heat release rate (HRR) is lower for an aged one. The total heat release (THR) of aged sheath is reduced by 16.9–18.5% compared to a new one. In addition, the cone calorimetry experiments illustrate that the ignition occurrence of an aged sheath is later than that of a new one under different incident heat fluxes. This work indicates that an aged sheath generally pyrolyzes and it combusts more weakly and incompletely.},

ABSTRACT = {The knowledge of the loads occurring during a manufacturing process (e.g., grinding) and of the modifications remaining in the material is used in the concept of process signatures to optimize the manufacturing process and compare it with others (e.g., laser processing). The prerequisite for creating a process signature is that the loads can be characterized during the running process. Due to the rough process conditions, until now there is no in-process technique to measure the loads in the form of displacements and strains in the machined boundary zone. For this reason, the suitability of speckle photography is demonstrated for in-process measurements of material loads in a grinding process without cooling lubricant and the measurement results are compared with finite element method (FEM) simulations. As working hypothesis for the simulation it is assumed, that dry grinding is a purely thermally driven process. Despite the approximation by a purely thermal model with a constant heat source, the measured displacements differ only by a maximum of approximately 20% from the simulations. In particular, the strain measurements in feed speed direction are in good agreement with the simulation and support the thesis, that the dry grinding conditions used here lead to a primarily thermally affecting process.},

ABSTRACT = {The new generation of ICT solutions applied to the monitoring, adaptation, simulation and optimisation of factories are key enabling technologies for a new level of manufacturing capability and adaptability in the context of Industry 4.0.

This paper presents an online tool wear classification system built in terms of a monitoring infrastructure, dedicated to perform dry milling on steel while capturing force signals, and a computing architecture, assembled for the assessment of the flank wear based on deep learning. In particular, this approach demonstrates that a big data analytics method for classification applied to large volumes of continuously-acquired force signals generated at high speed during milling responds sufficiently well when used as an indicator of the different stages of tool wear. This research presents the design, development and deployment of the system components and an overall evaluation that involves machining experiments, data collection, training and validation, which, as a whole, has shown an accuracy of 78%.},

ABSTRACT = {As an important energy conversion mechanism, centrifugal compressors play an important role in the national economy. The blade is one of the most critical components of the compressor. Damaged blades contain extremely high added value for remanufacturing. Thus, remanufacturing research on damaged and retired impeller/blade is getting more and more attention. Laser additive and milling subtractive composite remanufacturing technology is an effective means to achieve metal parts remanufacturing. In this paper, an advanced methodology for the remanufacturing of complex geometry and expensive components via reverse engineering, free-form surface modeling, laser additive repaired and machining is presented. The approach involves the integration of 3D non-contact digitization to obtain the point cloud data of damaged parts, adaptive free-form surface reconstruction to get the digital model of damage location, and laser additive manufacturing process containing slicing and path planning and subsequent multi-axis milling operation. The methodology has been successfully implemented on thin-curved centrifugal compressor blades. The results have shown that the composite remanufacturing method is an effective solution to realize the remanufacturing of damaged blades, and can be applied to the remanufacturing of other complicated parts.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper evaluates a physics-based analytical model in the prediction of machining temperature of AISI 1045 steel and AISI 4340 steel. The prediction model was developed based on the Johnson-Cook constitutive model (J-C model) and mechanics of the orthogonal cutting process. The average temperatures at two shear zones were predicted by minimizing the difference between calculated stresses using the J-C model and calculated stresses using the mechanics model. In this work, (1) the influence of input Johnson-Cook model constants, cutting force, and chip thickness on the accuracy of predictions are investigated with sensitivity analyses, in which multiple sets of available J-C constants and varying cutting force and chip thickness are used for the temperature prediction in machining AISI 1045 steel. The larger the input deviation, the larger prediction deviation. The temperature at the primary shear zone is more susceptible to the deviation of inputs than the temperature at the secondary shear zone. (2) The machining temperatures are also predicted in machining AISI 4340 steel using cutting tools with various specifications to demonstrate its predictive capability. Good agreements are observed upon validation to available experimental data in the literature. (3) Lastly, the advantage and limitation of the temperature model are discussed with comparison other analytical temperature models. Considering the reliable and easily measurable input requirements and sufficient predictive capability, this temperature model can be employed for effective and efficient machining temperature prediction.},

ABSTRACT = {Flame spray pyrolysis, widely used in chemical industries, is a technology to synthesize nanoparticles. While the flame spray pyrolysis uses fuels as a solution liquid, the flame-assisted spray pyrolysis method uses aqueous solutions. Since process parameters such as concentration of precursor, size of droplets, and ratio of the air–gas mixture affect the size of nanoparticles, developing a flexible system to control these parameters is required. This paper proposes a new type of nozzle system to produce nanoparticles using flame-assisted spray pyrolysis. The annular nozzle design allows flexible control of particle flow and temperature, and an ultrasonic nebulizer was used to produce droplets with different size. Experiments were conducted to analyze the relationship between nanoparticle size and process parameters, concentration of precursor, frequency of the atomizer, and flame temperature. A precursor solution consisting of silver nitrate (AgNO3) mixed in deionized water is used. The effects of the process parameters are discussed, and analysis of the nanoparticles shows that silver nanoparticles are deposited with an average size of 25~115 nm.},

ABSTRACT = {Hand scraping is a manual surface finishing process that, despite its low productivity and high cost, is still applied in many industries because of its advantages concerning accuracy and tribology. In the presented microanalysis forces, movement patterns and tool orientation of individual hand scraping strokes were measured using a test stand, specifically designed for this purpose. It utilizes a camera, a three dimensional dynamometer, and an inertial measurement unit (IMU). The results show the basic characteristics of hand scraping. Typical courses of relevant quantities like cutting force, passive force, clearance, and directional angle are shown. In addition, the movement pattern of the tool during individual scraping strokes is analyzed. This research aims to contribute to a later implementation of automated scraping. The conducted research creates a base for future research regarding different scraping methods and achieved results.},

ABSTRACT = {Remanufacturing is a viable option to extend the useful life of an end-of-use product or its parts, ensuring sustainable competitive advantages under the current global economic climate. Challenges typical to remanufacturing still persist, despite its many benefits. According to the European Remanufacturing Network, a key challenge is the lack of accurate, timely and consistent product knowledge as highlighted in a 2015 survey of 188 European remanufacturers. With more data being produced by electric and hybrid vehicles, this adds to the information complexity challenge already experienced in remanufacturing. Therefore, it is difficult to implement real-time and accurate remanufacturing for the shop floor; there are no papers that focus on this within an electric and hybrid vehicle environment. To address this problem, this paper attempts to: (1) identify the required parameters/variables needed for fuel cell remanufacturing by means of interviews; (2) rank the variables by Pareto analysis; (3) develop a casual loop diagram for the identified parameters/variables to visualise their impact on remanufacturing; and (4) model a simple stock and flow diagram to simulate and understand data and information-driven schemes in remanufacturing.},

ABSTRACT = {Inclusion of rubber into concrete changes its behavior and the established shape of its stress-strain curve. Existing constitutive stress-strain models for concrete are not valid in case of rubberized concrete, and currently available modified models require additional validation on a larger database of experimental results, with a wider set of influential parameters. By executing uniaxial compressive tests on concrete with rubber substituting 10%, 20%, 30%, and 40% of aggregate, it was possible to study and evaluate the influence of rubber content on its mechanical behavior. The stress-strain curve was investigated in its entirety, including compressive strength, elastic modulus, strains at significant levels of stress, and failure patterns. Experimental results indicated that increase of rubber content linearly decreases compressive strength and elastic modulus, but increases ductility. By comparing experimental stress-strain curves with those plotted using available constitutive stress-strain models it was concluded that they are inadequate for rubberized concrete with high rubber content. Based on determined deviations an improvement of an existing model was proposed, which provides better agreement with experimental curves. Obtained research results enabled important insights into correlations between rubber content and changes of the stress-strain curve required when utilizing nonlinear material properties.},

ABSTRACT = {The complex hierarchical structures of biological materials in combination with outstanding property profiles are great sources of inspiration for material scientists. Based on these characteristic features, the structure of wood has been increasingly exploited to fabricate novel hierarchical and functional materials. With delignification treatments, the density and chemistry of wood can be altered, resulting in hierarchical cellulose scaffolds with enhanced porosity for the fabrication of novel hybrid materials. In the present study, focusing on acidic delignification of beech wood and its influence on porosity, we report on a structural characterization and qualitative assessment of the cellulose scaffolds using mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP). To account for the effect of water removal from the hygroscopic structure, different drying methods—e.g., standard oven and freeze-drying—were applied. While native beech wood is characterized by the presence of macro, meso and micro pores, delignification altered the porosity, increasing the importance of the macropores in the pore size distribution. Furthermore, we showed that the final porosity obtained in the material is strongly dependent on the applied drying process. Samples delignified under harsh conditions at high temperature (mass loss of ~35%) show a 13% higher porosity after freeze-drying compared to oven-dried samples. The obtained results contribute to a better understanding of the impact of the delignification and drying processes on the porosity of cellulose scaffolds, which is of high relevance for subsequent modification and functionalization treatments.},

ABSTRACT = {The 3D microstructure around a tin whisker, and its evolution during heat treatment were studied using scanning 3DXRD. The shape of each grain in the sample was reconstructed using a filtered-back-projection algorithm. The local lattice parameters and grain orientations could then be refined, using forward modelling of the diffraction data, with a spatial resolution of 250 n m . It was found that the tin coating had a texture where grains were oriented such that their c-axes were predominantly parallel to the sample surface. Grains with other orientations were consumed by grain growth during the heat treatment. Most of the grain boundaries were found to have misorientations larger than 15 ∘ , and many coincidence site lattice (CSL) or other types of low-energy grain boundaries were identified. None of the grains with CSL grain boundaries were consumed by grain growth. During the heat treatment, growth of preexisting Cu6Sn5 occurred; these grains were indexed as a hexagonal η phase, which is usually documented to be stable only at temperatures exceeding 186 ∘ C . This indicates that the η phase can exist in a metastable state for long periods. The tin coating was found to be under compressive hydrostatic stress, with a negative gradient in hydrostatic stress extending outwards from the root of the whisker. Negative stress gradients are generally believed to play an essential role in providing the driving force for diffusion of material to the whisker root.},

ABSTRACT = {This article presents examples of numerical simulations done based on the real experiments of S700MC steel T-joint laser and hybrid welding. Presented results of numerical analyses carried out using SYSWELD show the possibilities offered to contemporary engineers by modern software used to make numerical analyses of production processes. After calibration of a heat source models on the chosen examples of S700MC steel 10-mm-thick T-joint laser and hybrid welding, distributions of temperature fields, thermal cycles, distributions of individual metallurgical phases and hardness, and strains and plastic deformations in simulated processes were calculated for one selected joint from both mentioned methods. The results of the analysis allow determining both the differences in the stress distributions and their minimal and maximal values. This article also presents the benefits resulting from the use of such analyses, due to the significant savings in time and resources to be spent on the development of correct technologies for joining modern construction materials such as thermomechanically treated steels, especially given that some of the results are unavailable or very difficult to collect using conventional measurement methods.},

ABSTRACT = {The aim of this study was to verify the effect of the formulation on the release kinetics of active substances from preparations containing iron ions using in-line conductivity measurements. A simple, fast method was developed and may be applied for detailed evaluation of some kinetics factors obtained from the release data. Four different equations were used: zero-order equation, first-order equation, models: Korsmeyer–Peppas and Hixson–Crowell. Values of the determined half-time release for zero and first-order kinetic models ranged from 11.56 to 89.97 min. In the case of analysis according to these typical models, the values of the square root of the correlation coefficients were included between 0.9916 and 0.9995. The results transformed for the Hixson–Crowell model as constant release Ks, ranged between 0.0160 and 0.0437. The values of the respective calculated squares of the correlation coefficient ranged from 0.9933 to 0.9959. The determined release rate constants according to the Korsmeyer–Peppas model were between 0.0023 and 0.1630. The coefficients ‘n’ of the Korsmeyer–Peppas equation did not exceed 1.2 with the corresponding r2 values 0.9408–0.9960. Obtained results confirmed that the method is applicable for evaluation of selected drug compositions containing iron ions.},

ABSTRACT = {One of the established limitations of metal additive manufacturing (AM) methods, such as selective laser melting (SLM), is the resulting rough surface finish. Laser polishing is one method that can be used to achieve an improved surface finish on AM printed parts. This study is focused on the laser surface polishing of AM parts using CO2 laser beam irradiation. Despite the fact that several researchers have investigated the traditional abrasive polishing method, there is still a lack of information reporting on the laser surface polishing of metal parts. In this study, AM 316L stainless steel cylindrical samples were polished using CO2 laser beam irradiation in continuous wave (CW) working mode. Two design of experiment models were developed for the optimization of the input processing parameters by statistical analysis of their effect on the resulting roughness. The processing parameters investigated were the laser beam power, the rotational speed of the sample, the number of laser scan passes, the laser beam focal position, and the percentage overlap of the laser tracks between consecutive passes. The characterization of the measured roughness and the modified layer microstructure was carried out using 3D optical and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). A maximum reduction of the roughness from 10.4 to 2.7 µm was achieved and no significant change in the microstructure phase type and micro-hardness was observed.},

ABSTRACT = {Here we report on how residence time influences the evolution of the structure and properties through each stage of the carbon fibre manufacturing process. The chemical structural transformations and density variations in stabilized fibres were monitored by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy and density column studies. The microstructural evolution and property variation in subsequent carbon fibres were studied by X-ray diffraction and monofilament tensile testing methods, which indicated that the fibres thermally stabilized at longer residence times showed higher degrees of structural conversion and attained higher densities. Overall, the density of stabilized fibres was maintained in the optimal range of 1.33 to 1.37 g/cm3. Interestingly, carbon fibres manufactured from higher density stabilized fibres possessed lower apparent crystallite size (1.599 nm). Moreover, the tensile strength of carbon fibres obtained from stabilized fibres at the high end of the observed range (density: 1.37 g/cm3) was at least 20% higher than the carbon fibres manufactured from low density (1.33 g/cm3) stabilized fibres. Conversely, the tensile modulus of carbon fibres produced from low density stabilized fibres was at least 17 GPa higher than those from high density stabilized fibres. Finally, it was shown that there is potential to customize the required properties of resultant carbon fibres suiting specific applications via careful control of residence time during the stabilization stage.},

ABSTRACT = {CAD/CAM (computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing) for indirect restorative materials has been recently introduced in dentistry. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the change of the surface micro-hardness of different restorative CAD/CAM materials after exposure to a carbonated acidic drink (Coca-Cola, Coca-Cola Company, Milan, Italy). One hundred and eighty specimens of identical size (2 mm thickness) were obtained by sectioning each tested CAD/CAM block of four materials: a hybrid ceramic (CERASMART™, GC Corporation, Tokyo, Japan), a resin nano ceramic (Lava™ Ultimate, 3M, Monrovia, CA, USA), a nanohybrid composite (Grandio blocs, VOCO GmbH, Cuxhaven, Germany), and a zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate glass ceramic (VITA SUPRINITY® PC; VITA Zahnfabrik, Bad Sackingen, Germany). Forty-five specimens of each material were tested. Micro-hardness was measured at baseline, after 7 days and after 28 days. The data were analyzed. The micro-hardness of each material varied significantly after immersion in Coca-Cola. The nanohybrid composite had a high initial micro-hardness and the greatest percentage loss after acid exposure. The hybrid ceramic and the resin nano ceramic had similar percentage losses of micro-hardness values even if the second material had higher initial values. The zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate glass ceramic had the highest baseline values and the lowest percentage loss of micro-hardness. The different CAD/CAM materials presented different micro-hardness values before and after acid exposure.},

ABSTRACT = {Reinforced concrete (RC) beams under cyclic loading usually suffer from reduced aggregate interlock and eventually weakened concrete compression zone due to severe cracking and the brittle nature of compressive failure. On the other hand, the addition of steel fibers can reduce and delay cracking and increase the flexural/shear capacity and the ductility of RC beams. The influence of steel fibers on the response of RC beams with conventional steel reinforcements subjected to reversal loading by a four-point bending scheme was experimentally investigated. Three slender beams, each 2.5 m long with a rectangular cross-section, were constructed and tested for the purposes of this investigation; two beams using steel fibrous reinforced concrete and one with plain reinforced concrete as the reference specimen. Hook-ended steel fibers, each with a length-to-diameter ratio equal to 44 and two different volumetric proportions (1% and 3%), were added to the steel fiber reinforced concrete (SFRC) beams. Accompanying, compression, and splitting tests were also carried out to evaluate the compressive and tensile splitting strength of the used fibrous concrete mixtures. Test results concerning the hysteretic response based on the energy dissipation capabilities (also in terms of equivalent viscous damping), the damage indices, the cracking performance, and the failure of the examined beams were presented and discussed. Test results indicated that the SFRC beam demonstrated improved overall hysteretic response, increased absorbed energy capacities, enhanced cracking patterns, and altered failure character from concrete crushing to a ductile flexural one compared to the RC beam. The non-fibrous reference specimen demonstrated shear diagonal cracking failing in a brittle manner, whereas the SFRC beam with 1% steel fibers failed after concrete spalling with satisfactory ductility. The SFRC beam with 3% steel fibers exhibited an improved cyclic response, achieving a pronounced flexural behavior with significant ductility due to the ability of the fibers to transfer the developed tensile stresses across crack surfaces, preventing inclined shear cracks or concrete spalling. A report of an experimental database consisting of 39 beam specimens tested under cyclic loading was also presented in order to establish the effectiveness of steel fibers, examine the fiber content efficiency and clarify their role on the hysteretic response and the failure mode of RC structural members.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper investigates the free vibration and compressive buckling characteristics of functionally graded graphene nanoplatelets reinforced composite (FG-GPLRC) beams containing open edge cracks by using the finite element method. The beam is a multilayer structure where the weight fraction of graphene nanoplatelets (GPLs) remains constant in each layer but varies along the thickness direction. The effective Young’s modulus of each GPLRC layer is determined by the modified Halpin-Tsai micromechanics model while its Poisson’s ratio and mass density are predicted according to the rule of mixture. The effects of GPLs distribution pattern, weight fraction, geometry, crack depth ratio (CDR), slenderness ratio as well as boundary conditions on the fundamental frequency and critical buckling load of the FG-GPLRC beam are studied in detail. It was found that distributing more GPLs on the top and bottom surfaces of the cracked FG-GPLRC beam provides the best reinforcing effect for improved vibrational and buckling performance. The fundamental frequency and critical buckling load are also considerably affected by the geometry and dimension of GPL nanofillers.},

ABSTRACT = {Aluminium–copper composite materials were successfully fabricated using spark plasma sintering with Al and Cu powders as the raw materials. Al–Cu composite powders were fabricated through a ball milling process, and the effect of the Cu content was investigated. Composite materials composed of Al–20Cu, Al–50Cu, and Al–80Cu (vol.%) were sintered by a spark plasma sintering process, which was carried out at 520 °C and 50 MPa for 5 min. The phase analysis of the composite materials by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) indicated that intermetallic compounds (IC) such as CuAl2 and Cu9Al4 were formed through reactions between Cu and Al during the spark plasma sintering process. The mechanical properties of the composites were analysed using a Vickers hardness tester. The Al–50Cu composite had a hardness of approximately 151 HV, which is higher than that of the other composites. The thermal conductivity of the composite materials was measured by laser flash analysis, and the highest value was obtained for the Al–80Cu composite material. This suggests that the Cu content affects physical properties of the Al–Cu composite material as well as the amount of intermetallic compounds formed in the composite material.},

ABSTRACT = {Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) thin films were deposited on glass substrates using ultrasonic spray pyrolysis (USP) at a fixed substrate temperature of 400 °C and various Fluorine/Tin (F/Sn) atomic ratios of 0, 0.1, 0.5, and 1.0. Effects of F/Sn atomic ratios on structural-morphological, compositional, electrical, optical, and nanomechanical properties of the FTO thin films were systematically studied. The FTO films exhibited a tetragonal structure with preferred orientations of (110), (200), and (211), and polycrystalline morphology with spear-like or coconut shell-like particles on the surfaces. The presence of F-doping was confirmed by XPS results with clear F1s peaks, and F-concentration was determined to be 0.7% for F/Sn = 0.1 and 5.1% for F/Sn = 0.5. Moreover, the resistivity of FTO films reduced remarkably from 4.1 mΩcm at F/Sn = 0 to 0.7 mΩcm at F/Sn = 1, primarily due to the corresponding increase of carrier concentration from 2 × 1020 cm−3 to 1.2 × 1021 cm−3. The average optical transmittance of the films prepared at F/Sn of 0–0.5 was over 90%, and it decreased to 84.4% for the film prepared at F/Sn = 1. The hardness (H) and Young’s modulus (E) of the FTO films increased when the F/Sn ratios increased from 0 to 0.5, reaching maximum values of H = 12.3 ± 0.4 GPa, E = 131.7 ± 8.0 GPa at F/Sn = 0.5. Meanwhile, the H and E reduced considerably when the F/Sn ratio further increased to 1.0, following the inverse Hall-Petch effect approximately, suggesting that the grain boundary effect played a primary role in manipulating the nanomechanical properties of the FTO films. Furthermore, favorable mechanical properties with large H/Ef and H 3 / E f 2 ratios were found for the FTO film prepared at F/Sn = 0.5, which possessed high crystallinity, large grain size, and compact morphology.},

ABSTRACT = {This study is devoted to the modeling and simulation of uncertainties in the constitutive elastic properties of material constituting a circular column under axial compression. To this aim, a probabilistic model dedicated to the construction of positive-definite random elasticity matrices was first used, involving two stochastic parameters: the mean value and a dispersion parameter. In order to compute the nonlinear effects between load and lateral deflection for the buckling problem of the column, a finite element framework combining a Newton-Raphson solver was developed. The finite element tool was validated by comparing the as-obtained critical buckling loads with those from Euler’s formula at zero-fluctuation of the elasticity matrix. Three levels of fluctuations of material uncertainties were then propagated through the validated finite element tool using the probabilistic method as a stochastic solver. Results showed that uncertain material properties considerably influenced the buckling behavior of columns under axial loading. The coefficient of variation of a critical buckling load over 500 realizations were 15.477%, 26.713% and 41.555% when applying dispersion parameters of 0.3, 0.5 and 0.7, respectively. The 95% confidence intervals of column buckling response were finally given. The methodology of modeling presented in this paper is a potential candidate for accounting material uncertainties with some instabilities of structural elements under compression.},

ABSTRACT = {Surface characterization and corrosion behavior of 90/10 copper-nickel alloy in seawater from Xiamen bay at 30 °C for 56 days were investigated in this study. The results indicated that the corrosion product layer was mainly a mixture of CuO, Cu2O, and Cu(OH)2, with a transition to CuCl, CuCl2, and Cu2(OH)3Cl during the corrosion process. However, as corrosion proceeds, the resistance of the product film was reduced due to its heterogeneous and fairly porous structures, which led to local corrosion of the alloy. The corrosion potentials (Ecorr) increase while corrosion current densities (Icorr) decrease with time because of the formation of protective oxide film.},

ABSTRACT = {An approach for the size measurement of particulate (nano)materials by transmission electron microscopy was evaluated. The approach combines standard operating procedures for specimen preparation, imaging, and image analysis, and it was evaluated on a series of certified reference materials and representative test materials with varying physical properties, including particle size, shape, and agglomeration state. The measurement of the median value of the minimal external particle diameter distribution was intra-laboratory validated. The validation study included an assessment of the limit of detection, working range, selectivity, precision, trueness, robustness, and ruggedness. An uncertainty that was associated to intermediate precision in the range of 1–7% and an expanded measurement uncertainty in the range of 7–20% were obtained, depending on the material and image analysis mode. No bias was observed when assessing the trueness of the approach on the certified reference materials ERM-FD100 and ERM-FD304. The image analysis method was validated in an inter-laboratory study by 19 laboratories, which resulted in a within-laboratory precision in the range of 2–8% and a between-laboratory precision of between 2% and 14%. The automation and standardization of the proposed approach significantly improves labour and cost efficiency for the accurate and precise size measurement of the particulate materials. The approach is shown to be implementable in many other electron microscopy laboratories.},

ABSTRACT = {In order to explore the relationship between the surface topography parameters and friction properties of a rough contact interface under fluid dynamic pressure lubrication conditions, friction experiments were carried out. The three-dimensional surface topography of specimens was measured and characterized with a profile microscopy measuring system and scanning electron microscope. The friction coefficient showed a trend of decreasing first and then increasing with the increase in some surface topography parameters at lower pressure, such as the surface height arithmetic mean Sa, surface height distribution kurtosis Sku, surface volume average volume Vvv, and surface center area average void volume Vvc, which are the ISO 25178 international standard parameters. The effects of surface topographic parameters on friction were analyzed and the wear mechanism of the worn surface was presented. The wear characteristics of the samples were mainly characterized as strain fatigue, grinding, and scraping. The results provide a theoretical basis for the functional characterization of surface topography.},

ABSTRACT = {A multi-strand composite welding wire was applied to join high nitrogen austenitic stainless steel, and microstructures and mechanical properties were investigated. The electrical signals demonstrate that the welding process using a multi-strand composite welding wire is highly stable. The welded joints are composed of columnar austenite and dendritic ferrite and welded joints obtained under high heat input and cooling rate have a noticeable coarse-grained heat-affected zone and larger columnar austenite in weld seam. Compared with welded joints obtained under the high heat input and cooling rate, welded joints have the higher fractions of deformed grains, high angle grain boundaries, Schmid factor, and lower dislocation density under the low heat input and cooling rate, which indicate a lower tensile strength and higher yield strength. The rotated Goss (GRD) ({110}〈1 1 ¯ 0〉) orientation of a thin plate and the cube (C) ({001}〈100〉) orientation of a thick plate are obvious after welding, but the S ({123}〈63 4 ¯ 〉) orientation at 65° sections of Euler’s space is weak. The δ-ferrite was studied based on the primary ferrite solidification mode. It was observed that low heat input and a high cooling rate results in an increase of δ-ferrite, and a high dislocation density was obtained in grain boundaries of δ-ferrite. M23C6 precipitates due to a low cooling rate and heat input in the weld seam and deteriorates the elongation of welded joints. The engineering Stress–strain curves also show the low elongation and tensile strength of welded joints under low heat input and cooling rate, which is mainly caused by the high fraction of δ-ferrite and the precipitation of M23C6.},

ABSTRACT = {Due to the rapid growth of 3D printing popularity, including fused deposition modeling (FDM), as one of the most common technologies, the proper understanding of the process and influence of its parameters on resulting products is crucial for its development. One of the most crucial parameters of FDM printing is the raster angle and mutual arrangement of the following filament layers. Presented research work aims to evaluate different raster angles (45°, 55°, 55’°, 60° and 90°) on the static, as well as rarely investigated, dynamic mechanical properties of 3D printed acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) materials. Configuration named 55’° was based on the optimal winding angle in filament-wound pipes, which provides them exceptional mechanical performance and durability. Also in the case of 3D printed samples, it resulted in the best impact strength, comparing to other raster angles, despite relatively weaker tensile performance. Interestingly, all 3D printed samples showed surprisingly high values of impact strength considering their calculated brittleness, which provides new insights into understanding the mechanical performance of 3D printed structures. Simultaneously, it proves that, despite extensive research works related to FDM technology, there is still a lot of investigation required for a proper understanding of this process.},

ABSTRACT = {The purpose of this work is to find an effective image segmentation method for lab-based micro-tomography (µ-CT) data of carbon fiber reinforced polymers (CFRP) with insufficient contrast-to-noise ratio. The segmentation is the first step in creating a realistic geometry (based on µ-CT) for finite element modelling of textile composites on meso-scale. Noise in X-ray imaging data of carbon/polymer composites forms a challenge for this segmentation due to the very low X-ray contrast between fiber and polymer and unclear fiber gradients. To the best of our knowledge, segmentation of µ-CT images of carbon/polymer textile composites with low resolution data (voxel size close to the fiber diameter) remains poorly documented. In this paper, we propose and evaluate different approaches for solving the segmentation problem: variational on the one hand and deep-learning-based on the other. In the author’s view, both strategies present a novel and reliable ground for the segmentation of µ-CT data of CFRP woven composites. The predictions of both approaches were evaluated against a manual segmentation of the volume, constituting our “ground truth”, which provides quantitative data on the segmentation accuracy. The highest segmentation accuracy (about 4.7% in terms of voxel-wise Dice similarity) was achieved using the deep learning approach with U-Net neural network.},

Samples were produced with the variation of process parameters and with a change in scanning strategy which plays a major role in stress generation.

ABSTRACT = {This paper investigates the ability of steel fibers to enhance the short-term behavior and flexural performance of realistic steel fiber-reinforced concrete (SFRC) structural members with steel reinforcing bars and stirrups using nonlinear 3D finite element (FE) analysis. Test results of 17 large-scale beam specimens tested under monotonic flexural four-point loading from the literature are used as an experimental database to validate the developed nonlinear 3D FE analysis and to study the contributions of steel fibers on the initial stiffness, strength, deformation capacity, cracking behavior, and residual stress. The examined SFRC beams include various ratios of longitudinal reinforcement (0.3%, 0.6%, and 1.0%) and steel fiber volume fractions (from 0.3% to 1.5%). The proposed FE analysis employs the nonlinearities of the materials with new and established constitutive relationships for the SFRC under compression and tension based on experimental data. Especially for the tensional response of SFRC, an efficient smeared crack approach is proposed that utilizes the fracture properties of the material utilizing special stress versus crack width relations with tension softening for the post-cracking SFRC tensile response instead of stress–strain laws. The post-cracking tensile behavior of the SFRC near the reinforcing bars is modeled by a tension stiffening model that considers the SFRC fracture properties, the steel fiber interaction in cracked concrete, and the bond behavior of steel bars. The model validation is carried out comparing the computed key overall and local responses and responses measured in the tests. Extensive comparisons between numerical and experimental results reveal that a reliable and computationally-efficient model captures well the key aspects of the response, such as the SFRC tension softening, the tension stiffening effect, the bending moment–curvature envelope, and the favorable contribution of the steel fibers on the residual response. The results of this study reveal the favorable influence of steel fibers on the flexural behavior, the cracking performance, and the post-cracking residual stress.},

ABSTRACT = {The use of fibers as mass reinforcement to delay cracking and to improve the strength and the post-cracking performance of reinforced concrete (RC) beams has been well documented. However, issues of common engineering practice about the beneficial effect of steel fibers to the seismic resistance of RC structural members in active earthquake zones have not yet been fully clarified. This study presents an experimental and a numerical approach to the aforementioned question. The hysteretic response of slender and deep steel fiber-reinforced concrete (SFRC) beams reinforced with steel reinforcement is investigated through tests of eleven beams subjected to reversal cyclic loading and numerical analysis using 3D finite element (FE) modeling. The experimental program includes flexural and shear-critical SFRC beams with different ratios of steel reinforcing bars (0.55% and 1.0%), closed stirrups (from 0 to 0.5%), and fibers with content from 0.5 to 3% per volume. The developed nonlinear FE numerical simulation considers well-established relationships for the compression and tensional behavior of SFRC that are based on test results. Specifically, a smeared crack model is proposed for the post-cracking behavior of SFRC under tension, which employs the fracture characteristics of the composite material using stress versus crack width curves with tension softening. Axial tension tests of prismatic SFRC specimens are also included in this study to support the experimental project and to verify the proposed model. Comparing the numerical results with the experimental ones it is revealed that the proposed model is efficient and accurately captures the crucial aspects of the response, such as the SFRC tension softening effect, the load versus deformation cyclic envelope and the influence of the fibers on the overall hysteretic performance. The findings of this study also reveal that SFRC beams showed enhanced cyclic behavior in terms of residual stiffness, load-bearing capacity, deformation, energy dissipation ability and cracking performance, maintaining their integrity through the imposed reversal cyclic tests.},

ABSTRACT = {Young’s modulus (E) is one of the most important parameters in the mechanical properties of solid materials. Young’s modulus is proportional to the stress and strain values. There are several experimental and theoretical methods for gaining Young’s modulus values, such as stress–strain curves in compression and tensile tests, electromagnetic-acoustic resonance, ultrasonic pulse echo and density functional theory (DFT) in different basis sets. Apparently, preparing specimens for measuring Young’s modulus through the experimental methods is not convenient and it is time-consuming. In addition, for calculating Young’s modulus values by software, presumptions of data and structures are needed. Therefore, this new method for gaining the Young’s modulus values of crystalline materials is presented. Herein, the new method for calculating Young’s modulus of crystalline materials is extracted by X-ray diffraction. In this study, Young’s modulus values were gained through the arbitrary planes such as random (hkl) in the research. In this study, calculation of Young’s modulus through the relationship between elastic compliances, geometry of the crystal lattice and the planar density of each plane is obtained by X-ray diffraction. Sodium chloride (NaCl) with crystal lattices of FCC was selected as the example. The X-ray diffraction, elastic stiffness constant and elastic compliances values have been chosen by the X’Pert software, literature and experimental measurements, respectively. The elastic stiffness constant and Young’s modulus of NaCl were measured by the ultrasonic technique and, finally, the results were in good agreement with the new method of this study. The aim of the modified Williamson–Hall (W–H) method in the uniform stress deformation model (USDM) utilized in this paper is to provide a new approach of using the W–H equation, so that a least squares technique can be applied to minimize the sources of errors.},

ABSTRACT = {One thin 5000 series aluminium alloy sheet and two thin 980 MPa grade cold rolled ultra-high strength steel sheets were joined by self-pierce riveting and mechanical clinching processes. The joinabilities for a combination of the aluminium and steel sheets in both processes were investigated for different die shapes in the experiment and finite element simulation. In self-pierce riveting, the three sheets were successfully joined for both combinations of the upper and lower aluminium alloy sheets by optimizing the shapes of a die and rivet. In mechanical clinching, the three sheets were successfully joined by an optimum die for the configuration of the upper aluminium alloy sheet. On the other hand, the three sheets for the configuration of the lower aluminium alloy sheet were not joined even by optimizing the die shape in the both finite element simulation and experiment, because the material flow of the steel sheets was insufficient to form the two interlocks. The tension-shear loads for the clinched and riveted sheets with the adhesive were almost the same, because the load for the adhesive was the highest. In the cross-tension test, however, the load by the adhesive was comparatively small.},

ABSTRACT = {The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has disrupted modern societies and their economies. The resurgence in COVID-19 cases as part of the second wave is observed across Europe and the Americas. The scientific response has enabled a complete structural characterization of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome—novel Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Among the most relevant proteins required by the novel coronavirus to facilitate the cell entry mechanism is the spike protein. This protein possesses a receptor-binding domain (RBD) that binds the cellular angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and then triggers the fusion of viral and host cell membranes. In this regard, a comprehensive characterization of the structural stability of the spike protein is a crucial step to find new therapeutics to interrupt the process of recognition. On the other hand, it has been suggested that the participation of more than one RBD is a possible mechanism to enhance cell entry. Here, we discuss the protein structural stability based on the computational determination of the dynamic contact map and the energetic difference of the spike protein conformations via the mapping of the hydration free energy by the Poisson–Boltzmann method. We expect our result to foster the discussion of the number of RBD involved during recognition and the repurposing of new drugs to disable the recognition by discovering new hotspots for drug targets apart from the flexible loop in the RBD that binds the ACE2.},

ABSTRACT = {Nanobubbles have many potential applications depending on their types. The long-term stability of different gas nanobubbles is necessary to be studied considering their applications. In the present study, five kinds of nanobubbles (N2, O2, Ar + 8%H2, air and CO2) in deionized water and a salt aqueous solution were prepared by the hydrodynamic cavitation method. The mean size and zeta potential of the nanobubbles were measured by a light scattering system, while the pH and Eh of the nanobubble suspensions were measured as a function of time. The nanobubble stability was predicted and discussed by the total potential energies between two bubbles by the extended Derjaguin–Landau–Verwey–Overbeek (DLVO) theory. The nanobubbles, except CO2, in deionized water showed a long-term stability for 60 days, while they were not stable in the 1 mM (milli mol/L) salt aqueous solution. During the 60 days, the bubble size gradually increased and decreased in deionized water. This size change was discussed by the Ostwald ripening effect coupled with the bubble interaction evaluated by the extended DLVO theory. On the other hand, CO2 nanobubbles in deionized water were not stable and disappeared after 5 days, while the CO2 nanobubbles in 1 mM of NaCl and CaCl2 aqueous solution became stable for 2 weeks. The floating and disappearing phenomena of nanobubbles were estimated and discussed by calculating the relationship between the terminal velocity of the floating bubble and bubble size.},

ABSTRACT = {The key goal of this study was to characterize surface properties of chosen dental materials on the base on the contact angle measurements and surface free energy calculations. Tested materials were incubated in the simulated oral environment and drinks to estimate an influence of conditions similar to those in the oral cavity on wetting and energetic state of the surface. Types of materials were as follows: denture acrylic resins, composite and PET-G dental retainer to compare basic materials used in a prosthetics, restorative dentistry and orthodontics. The sessile drop method was used to measure the contact angle with the use of several liquids. Values of the surface free energies were estimated based on the Owens–Wendt, van Oss–Chaudhury–Good and Zisman’s methods. The research showed that surface wetting depends on the material composition and storage conditions. The most significance changes of CA were observed for acrylic resins (84.7° ± 3.8° to 65.5° ± 3.5°) and composites (58.8° ± 4.1° to 49.1° ± 5.7°) stored in orange juice, and for retainers (81.9° ± 1.8° to 99.6° ± 4.5°) incubated in the saline solution. An analysis of the critical surface energy showed that acrylic materials are in the zone of good adhesion (values above 40 mJ/m2), while BIS-GMA composites are in the zone of poor adhesion (values below 30 mJ/m2). Study of the surface energy of different dental materials may contribute to the development of the thermodynamic model of bacterial adhesion, based on the surface free energies, and accelerate the investigation of biomaterial interaction in the biological environment.},

ABSTRACT = {A lightweight, highly corrosive resistant, and high-strength wrought alloy in the aluminum family is the Aluminium 8006 alloy. The AA8006 alloy can be formed, welded, and adhesively bonded. However, the recommended welding methods such as laser, TIG (Tungsten Inert Gas welding), and ultrasonic are more costly. This investigation aims to reduce the cost of welding without compromising joint quality by means of friction stir welding. The aluminum alloy-friendly reinforcement agent zirconia is utilized as particles during the weld to improve the performance of the newly identified material AA8006 alloy in friction stir welding (FSW). The objectives of this research are to identify the level of process parameters for the friction stir welding of AA8006 to reduce the variability by the trial-and-error experimental method, thereby reducing the number of samples needing to be characterized to optimize the process parameters. To enhance the quality of the weld, the friction stir processing concept will be adapted with zirconia reinforcement during welding. The friction stir-processed samples were investigated regarding their mechanical properties such as tensile strength and Vickers microhardness. The welded samples were included in the corrosion testing to ensure that no foreign corrosive elements were included during the welding. The quality of the weld was investigated in terms of its surface morphology, including aspects such as the dispersion of reinforced particles on the welded area, the incorporation of foreign elements during the weld, micro defects or damage, and other notable changes through scanning electron microscopy analysis. The process of 3D profilometry was employed to perform optical microscopy investigation on the specimens inspected to ensure their surface quality and finish. Based on the outcomes, the optimal process parameters are suggested. Future directions for further investigation are highlighted.},
