ABSTRACT = {Machining grooves and ridges (peaks) into the surface of wooden deckboards reduces undesirable checking that develops when “profiled” boards are exposed to the weather. We aim to develop improved profiles for amabilis fir decking to reduce its susceptibility to checking, and also to examine whether profiling influences distortion (cupping) of deckboards. We systematically varied radii of grooves and peaks, and the heights and widths of peaks in profiled deckboards, exposed them to the weather, and measured checking and cupping of boards. Profiling significantly reduced the numbers and sizes of checks in amabilis fir deckboards, but increased cupping. Profiles with narrow grooves and tall peaks were generally better at restricting checking than profiles with wide grooves and shorter peaks. Our results suggest that one of the profiles we tested would be better at restricting checking than profiles used previously to manufacture profiled decking from amabilis fir. We conclude that the surface checking of profiled amabilis fir decking can be significantly reduced by altering the geometry of surface profiles. In principal, the same approach could be used with other softwood species that have potential to capture a share of the large and important market for wood decking.},

ABSTRACT = {In this study, a precision motion stage, whose design utilizes a single shaft supported from the bottom by an air bearing and voice coil actuators in complementary double configuration, is evaluated for its dynamic properties, motion accuracy, and potential machining force response, through modal testing, laser interferometric metrology, and spectral analysis, respectively. Modal testing is carried out using two independent methods, which are both based on impact hammer testing. Results are compared with each other and with the predicted natural frequencies based on design calculations. Laser interferometry has been used with varying optics to measure the geometric errors of motion. Laser interferometry results are merged with measured servo errors, estimated thermal errors, and the predicted dynamic response to machining forces, to compile the error budget. Overall accuracy of the stage is calculated as peak-to-valley 5.7 μm with a 2.3 μm non-repeatable part. The accuracy measured is in line with design calculations which incorporated the accuracy grade of the encoder scale and the dimensional tolerances of structural components. The source of the non-repeatable errors remains mostly equivocal, as they fall in the range of random errors of measurement in laser interferometry like alterations of the laser wavelength due to air turbulence.},

ABSTRACT = {The question, how certain surface layer properties (for example, hardness or roughness) can be specifically influenced in different manufacturing processes, is of great economic interest. A prerequisite for the investigation of the formation of surface layer properties is the metrological assessment of the material stresses during processing. Up to now, no commercial in-process measuring system exists, which is able to determine material stresses in the form of mechanical strains in high-dynamic manufacturing processes with sufficient accuracy. A detailed analysis of the resolution limits shows that speckle photography enables deformation measurements with a resolution in the single-digit nanometer range. Thus, speckle photography basically offers the potential to measure material stresses during processing. Using the example of single-tooth milling, the applicability of speckle photography for in-process stress measurements is demonstrated. Even in such highly dynamic manufacturing processes with cutting speeds up to 10 m/s, the absolute measurement uncertainty of the strain is less than 0.05%. This is more than one order of magnitude lower than the occurring maximal strain. Therefore, speckle photography is suitable for characterizing the dynamic stresses and the material deformations in manufacturing processes.},

ABSTRACT = {Transparent, brittle materials, like glass, are used in various applications due to their advantages of mechanical and optical properties. However, their hard and brittle nature causes significant challenges to researchers when they design and test a new machining process. In order to optimize this time-consuming process, discrete element method (DEM) is applied to simulate the cutting process of soda-lime glass in this study. The first step is to create a synthetic material that behaves like soda-lime glass. Then, the macroproperties are calibrated by adjusting the microparameters of the DEM model to match the mechanical properties of the real soda-lime glass. Finally, orthogonal machining simulations are conducted and model validation are conducted by comparing the predicted cutting forces with those from the orthogonal cutting experiments.},

ABSTRACT = {Silicon nanotubes (SiNTs) have been researched as a promising anode material to replace graphite in next-generation lithium ion batteries. Chemical etching synthesis of SiNTs is a simple, controllable and scalable process for SiNT fabrication, but the environmental emissions are of grave concern. In this paper, the process emissions from chemical etching synthesis of SiNTs as anode for lithium ion batteries is studied through experimental techniques, considering the categories of aqueous wastes, gaseous emissions, aqueous nano-particle emissions, and gaseous aerosol emissions. The synthesized SiNTs are measured at 10 μm length and 1–2.2 μm diameter, and can maintain a specific capacity of over 800 mAh/g after 100 cycles in battery testing. In aqueous waste, the chemical compositions of all elements participating in the chemical etching are experimentally determined, with AgNO3 and Co(NO3)2 identified as the major pollutants. The only gaseous emission generated from the chemical etching synthesis process is H2, with 0.0088 ± 0.0002 mol H2 generated to produce 1.0 mg SiNTs. The aqueous nanoparticle sizes are found to be between 250 nm and 1540 nm. A large number of aerosol nanoparticle emissions of up to 2.96 × 107 particles/cm3 are detected through in situ experimental measurement.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper presents a prediction model for ground surfaces that uses the actual grinding wheel topography to perform a grinding simulation. Precise knowledge of expected machined surfaces plays an important role in process planning. Here, the main criterion is the achievement of the components’ function after manufacturing. Therefore, it is essential to consider the surface roughness to enable a function-orientated workpiece surface. The presented approach uses a real grinding tool topography, which is measured by a 3D laser triangulation sensor in the machine tool. After a data processing step, the measured topography is imported into a material removal simulation. A kinematic simulation of the realistic ground surface enables the data-based confirmation of the envelope profile theory for the first time.},

ABSTRACT = {The efficiency of laser beam processes basically depends on the efficiency of the laser beam source and the efficiency of the irradiated material’s energy absorption. This absorptivity can be influenced by the surface condition. Besides coating or boundary layers, the surface topography is decisive. In this study, the effects of various time–temperature distributions on the absorptivity changes of steel sheets were investigated. For this purpose, three steels were chosen, namely, a stainless steel, a spring steel, and a hot work tool steel. Pre- and post-process characterizations of the absorptivity and surface topography were performed. Controlled heating with a laser beam was carried out using temperatures between 700 and 1200 °C and durations between 2 and 34 s. In order to compare the influences of these heating procedures on the absorptivity, a characteristic value, the temperature‑compensated time, was introduced. It is shown that the surface roughness was influenced by laser irradiation but inadequately describes the increase of absorptivity. The changes in absorptivity are attributed to oxidation, which had an influence on the topography in a sub‑micrometer range. Moreover, a saturation effect is observed for intense heatings. Furthermore, it is shown that the temperature‑compensated time is a suitable value to describe absorptivity changes caused by short‑term heating.},

ABSTRACT = {The Ni-base superalloys facing high temperature require further protection against high temperature oxidation. One of the most common methods providing high temperature oxidation resistance is the production of aluminide layers (NiAl-coatings). It is known that the thickness of produced diffusion layer can be controlled by the temperature and time of aluminization process. However, no research on the effect of surface roughness on aluminization kinetics was conducted so far. Then, to elucidate the effect of surface roughness on aluminization kinetics, diffusion layers were obtained by an in-pack aluminization method on the IN 617 alloy with differently prepared surfaces, namely polished, ground using 220 grit SiC paper and 80 grit SiC paper. The obtained results revealed that different surface preparation does not affect the chemical and phase composition of produced layers. However, a strong influence of surface preparation method on aluminide layers thicknesses was observed. Namely, it was found that the increase in substrate surface roughness results in an increase of aluminization kinetics. The dependence between surface roughness and thickness of aluminide layers was found to be logarithmic. Moreover, it was found that the aluminization kinetics is influenced, especially at early stages of the aluminization process.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, a unique approach for estimating tool life using a hybrid finite element method coupled with empirical wear rate equation is presented. In the proposed approach, the computational time was significantly reduced when compared to nodal movement technique. However, to adopt such an approach, the angle between tool’s rake and flank faces must be constant through the process and at least two cutting experiments need to be performed for empirical model calibration. It is also important to predict the sliding velocity along the tool/flank face interface accurately when using Usui’s model to predict the tool wear rate. Model validations showed that when the sliding velocity was assumed to be equivalent to the cutting speed, poor agreement between the predicted and measured wear rate and tool life was observed, especially at low cutting speed. Furthermore, a new empirical model to predict tool wear rate in the initial or break-in period as a function of Von Mises stress field was developed. Experimental validation shows that the newly developed model substantially improved the initial tool wear rate in terms of trend and magnitude.},

ABSTRACT = {Heat-treatment is a frequently used technique for modifying the physical and chemical properties of materials. In this study, the effect of heat-treatment on the mechanical properties, thermal stability and surface morphology of two types of electrodeposited coatings (pure-Ni and Ni/Al2O3) were investigated. The XRD analyses showed that the crystal structure of the as-deposited coating changes from slightly amorphous to crystalline as the heat-treatment temperature increases. The heat-treatment of both the pure-Ni and the Ni/Al2O3 coating caused an increase of the grain size within the coatings. However, the unreinforced Ni coating experienced a faster growth rate than the Ni/Al2O3 coating, which resulted in a larger average grain size. The temperature-driven changes to the microstructure of the coatings caused a reduction in the hardness and wear resistance of the coatings. The presence of nanoparticles within the Ni/Al2O3 coating can successfully extend the operational temperature range of the coating to 473 K by pinning grain boundaries.},

ABSTRACT = {Hot stamping by partition heating of Al–Si coated boron steel sheets is currently utilized to produce parts of the car body-in-white with tailored microstructural and mechanical characteristics. This paper investigates the evolution of the Al–Si coating and its tribological and wear performances in the case of direct heating at the process temperatures of 700 °C, 800 °C, and 900 °C, skipping the preliminary austenitization as it may happen in the case of tailored tempered parts production. A specifically designed pin-on-disk configuration was used to reproduce at a laboratory scale the process thermo-mechanical cycle. The results show the morphological and chemical variation of the Al–Si coating with heating temperature, as well as that the friction coefficient, decreases with increased temperature. Furthermore, the results proved that the adhesive wear is the main mechanism at the lower temperature, while abrasive wear plays the major role at the higher temperature.},

ABSTRACT = {Several series of experiments were conducted to compare the performance of selected sets of subtractive and additive machine tools for meso-micro machining. Under the MicroCutting Project, meso-micro machining of a reference part was conducted to compare the performance of several machine tools. A prototype flexure of the microspline of an asteroid gripper under development at NASA/JPL was selected as the reference part for the project. Several academic, research institutes, and industrial firms were among the collaborators participating in the project. Both subtractive and additive machine tools were used, including abrasive waterjets, CNC milling, lasers, 3D printing, and laser powder bed fusion. Materials included aluminum, stainless steel, and nonmetal resins. Each collaborator produced the reference part in its facility using materials most suitable for their tools. The finished parts were inspected qualitatively and quantitatively at OMAX Corporation. The performance of the participating machine tools was then compared based on the results of the inspection. Test results show that the two top performers for this test part are the CNC precision milling and micro abrasive waterjet. For machining a single flexure, the CNC precision milling had a slight edge over the micro abrasive waterjet machining in terms of part accuracy and edge quality. The advantages disappear or the trend even reverses when stack machining with taper compensation is adopted for the micro abrasive waterjet.},

ABSTRACT = {The ultrasonic spot welding of fibre-reinforced thermoplastic laminates has received great interest from researchers, mainly in the fields of aerospace and automotive industries. It offers an efficient solution to join large thermoplastic composite parts through the spot welding approach with a high level of automation. In this paper, the temporal and spatial development of the temperature in an ultrasonic weld spot between two fibre-reinforced thermoplastic laminates was modelled. During the ultrasonic welding of thermoplastic composite laminates without energy directors a sudden temperature jump in the weld spot is usually observed. The temperature increase occurs rapidly up to the decomposition of the thermoplastic matrix and causes the degradation of the weld spot. To understand the temperature distribution within the weld spot and to calculate its temporal development, the thermal problem was analysed using a two-dimensional explicit finite difference method. To evaluate the models, the calculated time traces of the temperature in the weld spot were compared with the experimentally obtained values under comparable conditions.},

ABSTRACT = {In conventional forming processes, quasi-static conditions are a good approximation and numerical process optimization is the state of the art in industrial practice. Nevertheless, there is still a substantial need for research in the field of identification of material parameters. In production technologies with high forming velocities, it is no longer acceptable to neglect the dependency of the hardening on the forming speed. Therefore, a method for determining material characteristics in processes with high forming speeds was developed by designing and implementing a test setup and an inverse parameter identification. Two acceleration concepts were realized: a pneumatically driven one and an electromagnetically driven one. The method was verified for a mild steel and an aluminum alloy proving that the identified material parameters allow numerical modeling of high-speed processes with good accuracy. The determined material parameters for steel show significant differences for different stress states. For specimen geometries with predominantly uniaxial tensile strain at forming speeds in the order of 104–105/s the determined yield stress was nearly twice as high compared to shear samples; an effect which does not occur under quasi-static loading. This trend suggests a triaxiality-dependent rate dependence, which might be attributed to shear band induced strain localization and adiabatic heating.},

ABSTRACT = {To evaluate the prediction accuracy of the anisotropic yield function, we propose an original cruciform hole expansion test. Displacements on two axes were applied to the cruciform specimens with a hole in the center. The thickness strain in the region near the hole was compared to the simulation results. Because this forming test is free of friction and bending, it is an appropriate method to assess the anisotropic yield function without the influences of friction or the Bauschinger effect, or the need to consider the stress-strain curve in high-strain region. Hill1948, YLD2000-2D, and spline yield function which is an improved version of the Vegter model were selected, and 6000 series aluminum alloy sheets (A6116-T4) were used in this study. The parameter identification method of the spline yield function also proposed in this paper using the pseudo plane strain tensile test and optimization software. As a result, the spline yield function has better predictive accuracy than the conventional anisotropic yield functions Hill1948 and YLD2000-2D.},

During experimentation, the pulse-on-time (TON), pulse-off-time (TOFF), servo-voltage (SV), peak current (IP), and wire tension (WT) were chosen as control factors, whereas, the kerf width (Kf), surface roughness (Ra), and materials removal rate (MRR) were selected as performance attributes. The analysis of variance tests was performed to identify the control factors that significantly affect the performance attributes. The double hidden layer ANN model was developed using a back-propagation ANN algorithm, trained by the experimental results. The prediction accuracy of the established ANN model was found to be superior to the RSM model. Finally, the Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA- II) was implemented to determine the optimum WEDM conditions from multiple objectives.},

ABSTRACT = {The tribological effect of cutting fluids in the machining processes to reduce the friction in the cutting zone is still widely unknown. Most test benches and procedures do not represent the contact conditions of machining processes adequately, especially for interrupted contacts. This results in a lack of knowledge of the tribological behavior in machining processes. To close this knowledge gap, a novel experimental test bench to investigate the effects of cutting fluids on the frictional conditions in metal cutting under high-pressure cutting fluid supply was developed and utilized within this work. The results show that there is a difference between the frictional forces in interrupted contact compared to continuous contact. Furthermore, the cutting fluid parameters of supply pressure, volumetric flow rate, and impact point of the cutting fluid jet influence the frictional forces, the intensities of which depend on the workpiece material. In conclusion, the novel test bench allows examining the frictional behavior in interrupted cuts with an unprecedented precision, which contributes to a knowledge-based design of the cutting fluid supply for cutting tools.},

External X and Y dimensions were measured using a micrometer, as well as four surface roughness parameters (Ra, Rz, Rt, Rsm) with a surface tester. Two optimization techniques (the Taguchi approach and Grey relational analysis) were utilized along with statistical analysis to examine how the temperature and wall thickness affect the dimensional accuracy and the surface quality of the parts. The results showed that high extraction temperature and median wall thickness values optimize both dimensional accuracy and surface roughness, while temperature is the most important factor.},

ABSTRACT = {Due to their high speed and versatility, laser processing systems are now commonplace in many industrial production lines. However, as the need to reduce the environmental impact from the manufacturing industry becomes more urgent, there is the opportunity to evaluate laser processing systems to identify opportunities to improve energy efficiencies and thus reduce their carbon footprint. While other researchers have studied laser processing, the majority of previous work on laser systems has focused on the beam–material interaction, overlooking the whole system viewpoint and the significance of support equipment. In this work, a methodical approach is taken to design a set of energy modelling terminologies and develop a structured power metering system for laser systems. A 300 W fibre laser welding system is used to demonstrate the application of the power characterization system by utilizing a purpose-built power meter. The laser is broken down according to sub-system, with each part analysed separately to give a complete overall power analysis, including all auxiliary units. The results show that the greatest opportunities for efficiency improvements lie in the auxiliary units that support the laser devices as these were responsible for a majority of the electrical draw; 63.1% when the laser was operated at 240 W, and increasing as the beam power reduced. The remaining power draw was largely apportioned to electrical supply inefficiencies. In this work, the laser device delivered a maximum of 6% of the total system power. The implications of these results on laser processing system design are then discussed as is the suitability of the characterization process for use by industry on a range of specific laser processing systems.},

ABSTRACT = {The demand for inert bioceramics is always increasing in the dental field. Yttrium oxide tetragonal zirconia polycrystals (Y-TZP) are oxide ceramics which are currently used because of their interesting mechanical properties due to a toughening transformation. Industrially speaking, machining of the ceramic before sintering (green body) is very common because it allows a better productivity and it reduces crack probability during the sintering process. The goal of this paper is to determine the behavior of green ceramic during the machining operation. This study is carried out on several blanks with different binder percentages. The specific cutting energy (SCE) and the surface quality (Ra and Rz) are determined for several cutting speeds. The SCE follows a logarithmic evolution when the cutting speed increases. Despite this increase, the Ra are relatively stable whatever the cutting speed and the binder percentage. At a low cutting speed, a higher Rz value is observed caused by pullout of material. The increase of cutting speed allows to stabilize the Rz value whatever the binder percentage. This study shows that the green ceramic has a pseudo-plastic behavior whose machinability depends mainly on the interaction between the material and the cutting edge of the tool, so unlike pre-sintered ceramic or metallic part cutting speed has a low influence on the quality of the machined part.},

ABSTRACT = {In semi-solid metal high pressure die casting and in conventional high pressure die casting, it is common to find a defect band just below the surface of the component. The formation of these bands is not fully understood. However, there are several theories as how they occur, and it has been suggested that segregation is caused by the migration of aluminium-rich externally solidified crystals. In the present work the formation of these bands is investigated theoretically by reviewing suitable potential mechanisms for the migration of such crystals. Two mechanisms are identified as the most probable: Saffman lift force and the Mukai-Lin-Laplace effect. However, it was not possible to identify which of these two mechanisms acted in the case studies. Further testing is required to identify the mechanism that is causing the migration of the aluminium globules and suitable tests are proposed.},

ABSTRACT = {The longitudinal and transverse beams of trucks are manufactured with a large number of holes to fasten brackets for springs, fuel tanks, batteries etc. The quality of the holes, which is particularly influenced by the manufacturing process, has a major influence on the fatigue strength of the beams and thus the service lifetime of the vehicle. In most cases, the holes are produced using the highly economical shear cutting process. Previous investigations have shown that the fatigue strength of thin sheets can be increased by adjusting the shearing parameters and using a two-stage shear cutting process. This paper discusses the difference between one- and two-stage shear cutting on the hole quality of components made of S500MC (1.0984, thickness 8 mm) and its resulting fatigue strength. The hole quality is characterized by the geometry of the shear cut surface, its roughness, microstructure, and microhardness. It was shown that the two-stage shear cutting process allows producing holes of better quality than the ones manufactured by a one-stage shear cutting process. Furthermore, this resulted in an improved fatigue behavior.},

ABSTRACT = {Deep hole boring using slender bars that have tuned mass dampers integrated within them make the boring process chatter vibration resistant. Dampers are usually designed using classical analytical solutions that presume the (un)damped boring bar which can be approximated by a single degree of freedom system, and the damper is placed at the free end. Since the free end is also the cutting end, analytical models may result in infeasible design solutions. To place optimally tuned dampers within boring bars, but away from the free end, this paper presents a receptance coupling approach in which the substructural receptances of the boring bar modelled as a cantilevered Euler–Bernoulli beam are combined with the substructural receptances of a damper modelled as a rigid mass integrated anywhere within the bar. The assembled and damped system response thus obtained is used to predict the chatter-free machining stability limit. Maximization of this limit is treated as the objective function to find the optimal mass, stiffness and damping of the absorber. Proposed solutions are first verified against other classical solutions for assumed placement of the absorber at the free end. Verified models then guide prototyping of a boring bar integrated with a damper placed away from its free end. Experiments demonstrate a ~100-fold improvement in chatter vibration free machining capability. The generalized methods presented herein can be easily extended to design and develop other damped and chatter-resistant tooling systems.},

ABSTRACT = {Refill friction stir spot welding (RFSSW) is an emerging technology for joining aerospace aluminum alloys. The aim of the study is to investigate the effects of the refill friction stir spot weld spacing and the edge margin on the mechanical properties of multi-spot-welded AA7075-T6 panels. AA7075-T6 is a baseline aerospace aluminum alloy used in aircraft structures. The study employs an innovative robotic RFSSW system that is designed and developed by Kawasaki Heavy Industries (KHI). The experimental strategy uses Design of Experiments (DoE) to characterize the failure loads of multi-spot-welded panels in terms of the spot weld spacing, edge margin, and heat-affected zone (HAZ) of the spot weld. The RFSSW process leaves behind a thermal “imprint” as HAZ in heat-treatable aluminum alloys. According to the DoE results, larger spot weld spacings with no HAZ overlap produce higher failure loads of multi-spot-welded panels. On the other hand, edge margins that are equal to or less than the spot weld diameter demonstrate abnormal plastic deformations, such as workpiece edge swelling and weld crown dents, during the RFSSW process. The larger edge margins do not demonstrate such abnormal deformations during the welding process.},

ABSTRACT = {Numerical simulation of laser drilling is rapidly gaining interest in academia and industry since this process remains one of the most important and widely-used technologies in modern manufacturing. Meshfree methods such as Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) have proven to be successful as a numerical tool for the computation of the heat transfer and material removal associated with a laser drilling problem. Nonetheless, the vast majority of recent developments incorporate an inconsistent SPH kernel into their thermal simulations. In this paper, several enhanced schemes are implemented to address this problem by solving the heat transfer more accurately. These meshfree schemes can provide a second-order accurate discretization of the Laplace operator and abolish the inconsistency issue of the standard SPH kernels. An efficient approach is additionally suggested to handle the associated boundary conditions, which relies on the idea of the color function and particle label. The implementation is initially validated by a 3D benchmark study and then applied for the first time to a laser drilling problem.},

ABSTRACT = {Thermoplastic materials hold great promise for next-generation engineered and sustainable plastics and composites. However, due to their thermoplastic nature and viscoplastic material response, it is difficult to predict the properties of surfaces generated by machining. This is especially problematic in micro-channel machining, where burr formation and excessive surface roughness lead to poor component-surface integrity. This study attempts to model the influence of size effects, which occur due to the finite sharpness of any cutting tool, on surface finish and burr formation during micro-milling of an important thermoplastic material, polycarbonate. Experimental results show that the depth of cut does not affect either surface finish or burr formation. A proposed new sideflow model shows the dominant effect of cutting-edge radius and feed rate on surface finish, while tool edge roughness, coating and feed rate have the most pronounced influence on burr formation. Overall, a good agreement between the experimental data and the proposed size effect model for the machining of thermoplastic material was found. Based on these results, tool geometry and process parameters may be optimized for improved surface integrity of machined thermoplastic components.},

ABSTRACT = {Friction stir welding (FSW) has become an up-and-coming joining method with a wide range of industrial applications. Besides the unique weld seam properties, recent investigations have focused on the process-related tool wear of shoulder and probe, which can have detrimental economic and technological effects. This paper presents a systematic quantitative characterization of FSW tool wear using stripe light projection as a novel method to detect weight and form deviations of shoulder and probe. The investigations were carried out with a robotic welding setup in which AA-6060 T66 sheets, with a thickness of 8 mm, were joined by weld seams up to a total length of 80 m. During the experimental tests, geometrical deviations of the tool induced by wear were detected for varying weld seam lengths and different measuring points on the probe and shoulder. It was shown that wear depended on welding length which in turn caused significant deviations and weight losses on shoulder and probe. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the wear on shoulder and probe can be considered separately. It was found that there is a progressive wear rate on the shoulder and a degressive wear rate on the probe depending on the weld seam length. To demonstrate the negative impact of tool wear on shoulder and probe after 80 m weld seam length, visual and metallographic inspections and tensile tests were carried out to detect resultant irregularities in the weld seam.},

ABSTRACT = {AISI 52100 steel is often used as material for highly loaded rolling bearings in machine tools. An improved surface integrity, which can be achieved by means of mechanical surface layer finishing, can avoid premature failure. One of these finishing processes is machine hammer peening (MHP) which is a high-frequency incremental forming process and mostly used on machining centers. However, the influence of robot-guided MHP processing on the surface integrity of AISI 52100 steel is still unknown. Therefore, the objective of this work is to investigate experimentally the robot-based influences during MHP processing and the resulting surface integrity of unhardened AISI 52100 steel. The results show that the axial and lateral deviations of the robot due to process vibrations are in the lower µm range, thus enabling stable and reproducible MHP processing. By selecting suitable MHP process parameters and thus defined contact energies, even ground surfaces can be further smoothed and a hardness increase of 75% in the energy range considered can be achieved. In addition, compressive residual stress maxima of 950 MPa below the surface and a grain size reduction to a surface layer depth of 150 µm can be realized.},

ABSTRACT = {Based on the drive signals of a milling center, process forces can be reconstructed. Therefore, a novel approach is presented to reconstruct the process forces with a long short-term memory neural network (LSTM) using drive signals as an input. The LSTM is evaluated and compared to a model-based approach. The latter compensates nonlinearities and disturbances such as friction and inertia. For training of the LSTM, multiple milling processes are considered to enhance the generalizability. Training data is generated by recording drive signals and process forces measured by a dynamometer. The LSTM is then evaluated using a test set, which comprises new process parameters. It is shown that the LSTM has a lower root mean square error (RMSE) in comparison to the model-based approach. Especially, when changing the feed motion direction during milling, the neural network clearly outperforms the model-based approach. Nevertheless, there are processes, where the LSTM induced oscillations, which do not correspond to the measured forces.},

ABSTRACT = {In this work, a geometric model for surface generation of finish machining was developed in MATLAB, and subsequently verified by experimental surface roughness data gathered from turning tests in Ti-6Al4V. The present model predicts the behavior of surface roughness at multiple length scales, depending on feed, nose radius, tool edge radius, machine tool error, and material-dependent parameters—in particular, the minimum effective rake angle. Experimental tests were conducted on a commercial lathe with slightly modified conventional tooling to provide relevant results. Additionally, the model-predicted roughness was compared against pedigreed surface roughness data from previous efforts that included materials 51CrV4 and AL 1075. Previously obscure machine tool error effects have been identified and can be modeled within the proposed framework. Preliminary findings of the model’s relevance to subsurface properties have also been presented. The proposed model has been shown to accurately predict roughness values for both long and short surface roughness evaluation lengths, which implies its utility not only as a surface roughness prediction tool, but as a basis for understanding three-dimensional surface generation in ductile-machining materials, and the properties derived therefrom.},

ABSTRACT = {In manufacturing industries, selecting the appropriate cutting parameters is essential to improve the product quality. As a result, the applications of optimization techniques in metal cutting processes is vital for a quality product. Due to the complex nature of the machining processes, single objective optimization approaches have limitations, since several different and contradictory objectives must be simultaneously optimized. Multi-objective optimization method is introduced to find the optimum cutting parameters to avoid this dilemma. The main objective of this paper is to develop a multi-objective optimization algorithm using the hybrid Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA). In order to perform the multi-objective optimization, grey analysis is integrated with the WOA algorithm. In this paper, Stainless Steel 304 is utilized for turning operation to study the effect of machining parameters such as cutting speed, feed rate and depth of cut on surface roughness, cutting forces, power, peak tool temperature, material removal rate and heat rate. The output parameters are obtained through series of simulations and experiments. Then by using this hybrid optimization algorithm the optimum machining conditions for turning operation is achieved by considering unit cost and quality of production. It is also found that with the change of output parameter weightage, the optimum cutting condition varies. In addition to that, the effects of different cutting parameters on surface roughness and power consumption are analysed.},

ABSTRACT = {The aims and objectives of this paper are two-fold: first to investigate the production of a green composite manufactured with renewable materials (i.e., jute fabric as reinforcement, acrylate epoxidase soybean oil (AESO) as matrix and sisal particles (SP) as filler), by the wet layup method; second, to propose a recycling procedure to recover the individual materials and reuse them in the production of a second-life composite. In the first part, different combinations of SP (0, 5 and 10 wt%) and hardener (2, 5 and 10 wt%) were mixed with AESO resin, poured into a mould, cured and submitted to mechanical and physicochemical characterizations to identify the best conditions for the composite production. Virgin green composites with 10 wt% SP, 5 wt% hardener and 5 layers of jute fabric, capable of assuring 91 HA of hardness and 10.6 MPa of tensile strength, were fabricated. The second part describes the recycling process of the composites with acetone, an organic solvent recommended by the safety, health and environmental criteria, to breakdown the resin matrix and recover the jute fabric reinforcement and resin particles, which were then reused to fabricate a second-life composite. Although the hardness values of the second-life composite were smaller (4%) and the tensile strength varied with composition, the absorption of water was considerably reduced (in the range of 22 to 51%). This last result mitigates one of the green composite’s limitations and fosters circular economy by assuring the applications of the second-life composite in the field of transportations, packing and furniture, among others.},

ABSTRACT = {The purpose of machining operations is to make specific shapes or surface characteristics for a product. Conditions for machining operations were traditionally selected based on geometry and surface finish requirements. However, nowadays, many researchers are optimizing machining parameters since high-quality products can be produced using more expensive and advanced machines and tools. There are a few methods to optimize the machining process, such as minimizing unit production time or cost or maximizing profit. This research focused on maximizing the profit of computer numerical control (CNC) milling operations by optimizing machining parameters. Cutting speeds and feed are considered as the main process variables to maximize the profit of CNC milling operations as they have the greatest effect on machining operation. In this research, the Nelder–Mead simplex method was used to maximize the profit of CNC milling processes by optimizing machining parameters. The Nelder–Mead simplex method was used to calculate best, worst, and second-worst value based on an initial guess. The possible range of machining parameters was limited by several constraints. The Nelder–Mead simplex method yielded a profit of 3.45 ($/min) when applied to a commonly used case study model.},

ABSTRACT = {Milling processes are often limited by self-excited vibrations of the tool or workpiece, generated by the regenerative effect, especially when using long cantilevered tools or machining thin-walled workpieces. The regenerative effect arises from a periodic modulation of the uncut chip thickness within the frequencies of the eigenmodes, which results in a critical excitation in the consecutive cuts or tooth engagements. This paper presents a new approach for disturbing the regenerative effect by using milling tools which are modified with asymmetric dynamic properties. A four-fluted milling tool was modified with parallel slots in the tool shank in order to establish asymmetric dynamic characteristics or different eigenfrequencies for consecutive tooth engagements, respectively. Measurements of the frequency response functions at the tool tip showed a decrease in the eigenfrequencies as well as an increase in the dynamic compliance in the direction of the grooves. Milling experiments with a constant width of cut and constantly increasing axial depth of cut indicated a significant increase in the stability limit for the specific preparations of up to 69%.},

ABSTRACT = {Within the scope of this work, a new surface engineering technology named laser implantation has been investigated, in order to improve the tribological performance of hot stamping tools. This technique is based on manufacturing highly wear-resistant, separated, and elevated microfeatures by embedding hard ceramic particles into the tool surface via pulsed laser radiation. Hence, the topography and material properties of the tool are modified, which influences the thermal and tribological interactions at the blank-die interface. To verify these assumptions and to clarify the cause–effect relations, different titanium-based particles (TiB2, TiC, TiN) were laser-implanted and subsequently analyzed regarding to their geometrical shape and mechanical properties. Afterwards, quenching tests as well as tribological experiments were carried out by using titanium-diboride as the most promising implantation material for reducing the tribological load due to high hardness value of the generated implants. Compared to conventional tooling systems, the modified tool surfaces revealed a significantly higher wear resistance as well as reduced friction forces while offering the possibility to adjust the thermal interactions at the blank-die interface. Based on these results, a tailored tool surface modification can be pursued in future research work, in order to enhance the effectiveness of the hot stamping technology.},

ABSTRACT = {Lightweight structures in the automotive and transportation industry are increasingly researched. Multiple materials with tailored properties are integrated into structures via a large spectrum of joining techniques. Welding is a viable solution in mass scale production in an automotive sector still dominated by steels, although hybrid structures involving other materials like aluminum are becoming increasingly important. The welding of dissimilar metals is difficult if not impossible, due to their differential thermo mechanical properties along with the formation of intermetallic compounds, particularly when fusion welding is envisioned. Solid-state welding, as with magnetic pulse welding, is of particular interest due to its short processing cycles. However, electromagnetic pulse welding is constrained by the selection of processing parameters, particularly the coil design and its life cycle. This paper investigates two inductor designs, a linear (I) and O shape, for the joining of sheet metals involving aluminum and steels. The O shape inductor is found to be more efficient both with magnetic pulse (MPW) and magnetic pulse spot welding (MPSW) and offers a better life cycle. Both simulation and experimental mechanical tests are presented to support the effect of inductor design on the process performance.},

ABSTRACT = {Titanium alloy Ti6Al4V is a difficult-to-machine material which is extensively used in the aerospace and medical industries. Machining titanium is associated with a short tool life and low productivity. In this paper, a new cooling-lubrication system based on electrohydrodynamic atomization was designed, manufactured and tested and the relevant theory was developed. The major novelty of the system lies within the use of electrohydrodynamic atomization (EHDA) and a three-electrode setup for generating lubricant droplets. The system was tested and compared with that of flood, minimum quantity lubrication (MQL) and compressed air machining. The proposed system can extend the tool life by 6 and 22 times when compared with MQL and flood cooling, respectively. This is equivalent to more than 170 min tool life at 120 m/min cutting speed allowing for significant productivity gains in machining Ti6Al4V.},

ABSTRACT = {This study presents the fundamentals of the usage of frequency response functions (FRF) directly in time-domain-based methods. The methodology intends to combine the advantages of frequency- and time-domain-based techniques to determine the stability of stationary solutions of a given milling process. This is achieved by applying the so-called impulse dynamic subspace (IDS) method, with which the impulse response function (IRF) can be disassembled to separated singular IRFs that form the basis of the used transformation. Knowing the IDS state, the linear stability boundaries can be constructed and a measure of stability can be determined using the Floquet multipliers via the semidiscretization method (SDM). This step has a huge importance in parameter optimization where the multipliers can be used as objective functions, which is hardly achievable using frequency-domain-based methods. Here we present the basic idea of utilizing the IDS method and analyze its convergence properties.},

ABSTRACT = {Inconel 718 alloy fabricated by selective laser melting (SLM) (or laser powder-bed fusion (LPBF)) has been post-process heat-treated by stress-relief anneal at 1065 °C; stress-relief anneal (1065 °C) + solution treatment (at 720 °C) + aging (at 620 °C); hot isostatic pressing (HIP) (at 1120–1200 °C); stress-relief anneal + HIP; and stress-relief anneal + HIP + solution treatment + aging. Microstructure analysis utilizing optical metallography revealed primarily equiaxed grain structures (having average diameters ranging from ~30 to 49 microns) containing annealing twins, and a high concentration of carbide precipitates in all HIP-related treatments in the grain boundaries and intragrain regions. However, no precipitates nucleated on the {111} coherent annealing twin boundaries because of their very low interfacial free energy in contrast to regular grain boundaries. The mechanical properties for the as-fabricated Inconel 718 exhibited a yield stress of 0.64 GPa, UTS of 0.98 GPa, and elongation of 26%. Following stress-relief anneal at 1065 °C, the yield stress dropped to 0.60 GPa, while the elongation increased to 43%. The associated grain structure was an irregular, somewhat elongated, recrystallized structure. This structure was preserved at a stress anneal at 1065 °C + solution treatment + aging, but grain boundary and intragrain precipitation resulted in a doubling of the yield stress to 1.3 GPa and a reduced elongation of 12.6%. The results of HIP-related post-process heat treatments involving temperatures above 1060 °C demonstrated that the yield stress and elongations could be varied from 1.07 to 1.17 GPa and 11.4% to 19%, respectively. Corresponding Rockwell C-scale hardness values also varied from 33 for the as-fabricated Inconel 718 to 53 for simple post-process HIP treatment at 1163 °C.},

ABSTRACT = {Multi-material jetting (CerAM MMJ, previously T3DP) enables the additive manufacturing of ceramics, metals, glass and hardmetals, demonstrating comparatively high solid contents of the processed materials. The material is applied drop by drop onto a substrate. The droplets can be adapted to the component to be produced by a large degree of freedom in parameterization. Thus, large volumes can be processed quickly and fine structures can be displayed in detail, based on the droplet size. Data-driven methods are applied to build process knowledge and to contribute to the optimization of CerAM MMJ manufacturing processes. As a basis for the computational exploitation of mass sensor data from the technological process chain for manufacturing a component with CerAM MMJ, a data management plan was developed with the help of an engineering workflow. Focusing on the process step of green part production, droplet structures as intermediate products of 3D generation were described by means of droplet height, droplet circularity, the number of ambient satellite particles, as well as the associated standard deviations. First of all, the weighting of the factors influencing the droplet geometry was determined by means of single factor preliminary tests, in order to be able to reduce the number of factors to be considered in the detailed test series. The identification of key influences (falling time, needle lift, rising time, air supply pressure) permitted an optimization of the droplet geometry according to the introduced target characteristics by means of a design of experiments.},

ABSTRACT = {In the work described here, Gaussian process regression was applied to predict the ultimate tensile strength of friction stir welds through data evaluation and to therefore avoid destructive testing. For data generation, a total of 54 welding experiments were conducted in the butt joint configuration using the aluminum alloy EN AW-6082-T6. Four tensile samples were taken from each of the 54 experiments and the resulting ultimate tensile strength of the weld seam segment was modeled as a function of the weld’s surface topography. Further models were created for comparison, which received either the process variables or the process parameters to predict the ultimate tensile strength. It was shown that the ultimate tensile strength can be accurately predicted based on the weld’s surface topography. Especially for low welding speeds, the correlation coefficients between the true and the predicted ultimate tensile strength were high. However, overall, even higher correlation coefficients could be achieved when providing the process variables or the process parameters to the model. In conclusion, it was shown that the developed Gaussian process regression model is a powerful approach for replacing destructive testing and for predicting ultimate tensile strength based solely on data that can be collected non-destructively.},

ABSTRACT = {Preheating is the first but critical step for hot stamping high strength precipitate hardened aluminum alloys. To thoroughly understand the effects of preheating conditions—i.e., preheating rate and heating temperature—on the strength and hot deformation of aluminum alloys, a series of thermal–mechanical tests was performed to determine the post-hardness evolution and hot flow behaviors. Typical microstructures with different preheating conditions were also observed through transmission electron microscopy (TEM), with which a unified model of both hot flow and strength based on key microstructural variables was developed, enabling the successful prediction of macroscopic properties using different preheating strategies. The results have shown that for high strength AA7075 at the T6 condition, the dominant mechanism of precipitate evolution with increasing temperature is the coarsening of precipitates first, followed by dissolution when they exceed a critical temperature. A higher heating rate results in a slower coarsening and a relatively higher strength level. In addition, the flow stress of hot deformation is also higher using a quick heating rate, with more significant softening and reduced ductility.},

ABSTRACT = {During the milling of thin-walled workpieces, the natural frequencies might change radically due to the material removal. To avoid resonant spindle speeds and chatter vibration, a precise knowledge of the instantaneous modal parameters is necessary. Many different numerical methods exist to predict the changes; however, small unmodelled effects can lead to unreliable results. The natural frequencies could be measured by human experts based on modal analysis for an often interrupted process; however, this method is not acceptable during production. We propose an online measurement method with an automatic ball shooter device which can excite a wide frequency range of the flexible workpiece. The method is presented for the case of blade profile machining. The change of the natural frequencies is predicted based on analytical models and finite element simulations. The measurement response for the impulse excitation of the ball shooter device is compared to the results of impulse modal tests performed with a micro hammer. It is shown that the ball shooter is capable of determining even the slight variation of the natural frequencies during the machining process and of distinguishing the slight change caused by different clamping methods. An improved FE model is proposed to include the contact stiffness of the fixture.},

ABSTRACT = {Due to their flexibility, low cost and large working volume, 6-axis articulated industrial robots are increasingly being used for drilling, trimming and machining operations, especially in aerospace manufacturing. However, producing high quality components has demonstrated to be difficult, as a result of the inherent problems of robots, including low structural stiffness and low positional accuracy. These limit robotic machining to non-critical components and parts with low accuracy and surface finish requirements. Studies have been carried out to improve robotic machine capability, specifically positioning accuracy and vibration reduction. This study includes the description of the hardware, software and methodologies developed to compensate robot path errors in real time using a single three-degrees-of-freedom (DOF) laser tracker, as well as the experimental results with and without compensation. Performance tests conducted include ballbar dynamic path accuracy test, a series of drilling case studies and a machining test. The results demonstrate major improvements in path accuracy, hole position accuracy and hole quality, as well as increases in accuracy of a machined aluminum part.},

The standard deviation of the hardness of the sheet heated to 900 °C in 3.2 s without temperature holding at the austenitising temperature was 12 HV, whereas the deviation reduced to 5 HV for temperature holding at the austenitising temperature of 3 s.},

ABSTRACT = {A mechanochemical effect is investigated to reduce diamond tool wear by means of applying a surfactant to low-carbon magnetic iron during diamond turning. Orthogonal microcutting demonstrates the manifestation of the mechanochemical effect through the reduction of cutting forces by 30%, which supports the notion of lower cutting temperatures for reduced tribo-chemical wear. This is affirmed by the reduction in tool flank wear by up to 56% with the mechanochemical effect during diamond turning. While wear suppression increases by 9.4–16.15% with feeds from 5–20 μm/rev, it is not proportional to the reduction in cutting forces (31–39.8%), which suggests that the reduction in cutting energy does not directly correspond with the reduction in heat energy to sustain tribo-chemical tool wear. The strain localization during chip formation is proposed to serve as a heat source that hinders the wear mitigation efficiency. Finite element simulations demonstrate the heat generation during strain localization under the mechanochemical effect, which counteracts the reduced heat conversion from the plastic deformation and the transfer from tool–chip contact. Hence, this paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the mechanochemical method and its ability to reduce tool wear, but also establishes its limitations due to its inherent nature for heat generation.},

ABSTRACT = {When assessing the effect of metal cutting processes on the resulting surface layer, the heat generated in the chip formation zone that is transferred into the workpiece is of major concern. Models have been developed to estimate temperature distributions in machining processes. However, most of them need information on the heat partition as input for the calculations. Based on analytical and numerical models, it is possible to determine the fraction of shear plane heat transferred into the workpiece for orthogonal cutting conditions. In the present work, these models were utilized to gain information on the significant influencing factors on heat partition, based on orthogonal cutting experiments, experimental results from the literature, and a purely model-based approach. It could be shown that the heat partition does not solely depend on the cutting velocity, the uncut chip thickness, and the thermal diffusivity—combined in the dimensionless thermal number—but the shear angle also has to be taken into account, as already proposed by some researchers. Furthermore, developed numerical models show that a more realistic representation of the process kinematics, e.g., regarding chip flow and temperature-dependent material properties, do not have a relevant impact on the heat partition. Nevertheless, the models still assume an idealized orthogonal cutting process and comparison to experimental-based findings on heat partition indicates a significant influence of the cutting edge radius and the friction on the flank face of the tool.},

The laser beam welding process is supported by the hot-wire technology. The additional energy is utilized to increase the deposition rate of the filler material by increasing feeding rates and well-defining the thermal management in the welding zone. The simultaneous application of laser pulse modulation allows the precise control of the temperature gradients to minimize the hot-crack formation. Accompanying investigations such as high-speed recordings and numerical simulations allow a generalized statement on the influence of the adapted heat management on the resulting weld seam geometry (dilution, aspect ratio and wetting angle) as well as the formation of hot-cracks and lack of fusion between base and filler material. Statistical analysis of the data—the input parameters like laser pulse energy, pulse shape, hot-wire power and wire-feeding rate in conjunction with the objectives like dilution, aspect ratio, wetting angle and hot-cracking behavior—revealed regression functions to predict certain weld seam properties and hence the required input parameters.},

ABSTRACT = {The constantly increasing demand for both, higher production output and more complex product geometries, which can only be achieved using five-axis milling processes, requires elaborated analysis approaches to optimize the regarded process. This is especially necessary when the used tool is susceptible to vibrations, which can deteriorate the quality of the machined workpiece surface. The prediction of tool vibrations based on the used NC path and process configuration can be achieved by, e.g., applying geometric physically-based process simulation systems prior to the machining process. However, recent research showed that the dynamic behavior of the system, consisting of the machine tool, the spindle, and the milling tool, can change significantly when using different inclination angles to realize certain machined workpiece shapes. Intermediate dynamic properties have to be interpolated based on measurements due to the impracticality of measuring the frequency response functions for each position and inclination angle that are used along the NC path. This paper presents a learning-based approach to predict the frequency response function for a given pose of the tool center point.},

ABSTRACT = {Unforeseen machine tool component failures cause considerable losses. This study presents a new approach to unsupervised machine component condition identification. It uses test cycle data of machine components in healthy and various faulty conditions for modelling. The novelty in the approach consists of the time series representation as features, the filtering of the features for statistical significance, and the use of this feature representation to train a clustering model. The benefit in the proposed approach is its small engineering effort, the potential for automation, the small amount of data necessary for training and updating the model, and the potential to distinguish between multiple known and unknown conditions. Online measurements on machines in unknown conditions are performed to predict the component condition with the aid of the trained model. The approach was exemplarily tested and verified on different healthy and faulty states of a grinding machine axis. For the accurate classification of the component condition, different clustering algorithms were evaluated and compared. The proposed solution demonstrated encouraging results as it accurately classified the component condition. It requires little data, is straightforward to implement and update, and is able to precisely differentiate minor differences of faults in test cycle time series.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper presents a framework to utilize multivariate time series data to automatically identify reoccurring events, e.g., resembling failure patterns in real-world manufacturing data by combining selected data mining techniques. The use case revolves around the auxiliary polymer manufacturing process of drying and feeding plastic granulate to extrusion or injection molding machines. The overall framework presented in this paper includes a comparison of two different approaches towards the identification of unique patterns in the real-world industrial data set. The first approach uses a subsequent heuristic segmentation and clustering approach, the second branch features a collaborative method with a built-in time dependency structure at its core (TICC). Both alternatives have been facilitated by a standard principle component analysis PCA (feature fusion) and a hyperparameter optimization (TPE) approach. The performance of the corresponding approaches was evaluated through established and commonly accepted metrics in the field of (unsupervised) machine learning. The results suggest the existence of several common failure sources (patterns) for the machine. Insights such as these automatically detected events can be harnessed to develop an advanced monitoring method to predict upcoming failures, ultimately reducing unplanned machine downtime in the future.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper presents the development and evaluation of a digital method for multi-criteria optimized production planning and control of production equipment in a case-study of an Austrian metal casting manufacturer. Increased energy efficiency is a major requirement for production enterprises, especially for energy intensive production sectors such as casting. Despite the significant energy-efficiency potential through optimized planning and the acknowledged application potential for sophisticated simulation-based methods, digital tools for practical planning applications are still lacking. The authors develop a planning method featuring a hybrid (discrete-continuous) simulation-based multi-criteria optimization (a multi-stage hybrid heuristic and metaheuristic method) for a metal casting manufacturer and apply it to a heat treatment process, that requires order batching and sequencing/scheduling on parallel machines, considering complex restrictions. The results show a ~10% global goal optimization potential, including traditional business goals and energy efficiency, with a ~6% energy optimization. A basic feasibility demonstration of applying the method to synchronize energy demand with fluctuating supply by considering flexible energy prices is conducted. The method is designed to be included in the planning loop of metal casting companies: receiving orders, machine availability, temperature data and (optional) current energy market price-data as input and returning an optimized plan to the production-IT systems for implementation.},

ABSTRACT = {Injection moulding is one the most familiar processes for manufacturing of plastic parts by injecting molten thermoplastic polymers into a metallic mould. The cycle time of this process consists of the phases of injection, packing, cooling, and ejection of the final product. Shortening of cycle time is a key consideration to increase productivity. Therefore, in this manuscript the adoption of additively manufactured mould inserts with conformal cooling channels by means of selective laser melting (SLM) with the aim to reduce process cycles is presented. The design and manufacture of a mould insert with conformal cooling channels for producing pressure fitting thermoplastic parts is described. Numerical analysis of the injection process and simulation of shape distortions after SLM were conducted providing useful results for the design and manufacture of the mould insert. The results of the numerical analyses are compared with experimental 3D geometrical data of the additively manufactured mould insert. Temperature measurements during the real injection moulding process demonstrating promising findings. The adoption of the introduced method for the series production of injection moulded thermoplastics proves a shortening of cycle times of up to 32% and a final product shape quality improvement of up to 77% when using mould inserts with conformal cooling channels over the conventional mould inserts.},

ABSTRACT = {In manufacturing supply chains with labour-intensive operations and processes, individuals perform various types of manual tasks and quality checks. These operations and processes embrace engagement with various forms of paperwork, regulation obligations and external agreements between multiple stakeholders. Such manual activities can increase human error and near misses, which may ultimately lead to a lack of productivity and performance. In this paper, a multi-agent cyber-physical system (CPS) architecture with radio frequency identification (RFID) technology is presented to assist inter-layer interactions between different manufacturing phases on the shop floor and external interactions with other stakeholders within a supply chain. A dynamic simulation model in the AnyLogic software is developed to implement the CPS-RFID solution by using the agent-based technique. A case study from cryogenic warehousing in cell and gene therapy has been chosen to test the validity of the presented CPS-RFID architecture. The analyses of the simulation results show improvement in efficiency and productivity, in terms of resource time-in-system.},

ABSTRACT = {The resources of modern Finite Element Analysis (FEA) software provide engineers with powerful mechanisms that can be used to investigate numerous machining processes with satisfying results. Nevertheless, the success of a simulation, especially in three dimensions, relies heavily on the accuracy of the cutting tool models that are implemented in the analyses. With this in mind, the present paper presents an application developed via Computer-Aided Design (CAD) programming that enables the automated design of accurate cutting tool models that can be used in 3D turning simulations. The presented application was developed with the aid of the programming resources of a commercially available CAD system. Moreover, the parametric design methodology was employed in order to design the tools according to the appropriate standards. Concluding, a sample tool model was tested by performing a number of machining simulations based on typical cutting parameters. The yielded results were then compared to experimental values of the generated machining force components for validation. The findings of the study prove the functionality of the tool models since a high level of agreement occurred between the acquired numerical results and the experimental ones.},

ABSTRACT = {Hydrothermal processes can produce regular micro-/nano-structures easily; but their placement or position is difficult to control, and the obtainable structures tend to be random. For controlling the crystal growth, two types of definite and regular structures were obtained. The first ones were ZnO urchin-like structures synthesized from located ZnO particles as the nuclei. These structures were found to work as gas sensors utilizing a wide surface area. The second one was a vertically aligned TiO2 nanorod array synthesized on a fluorine-doped tin oxide substrate that has a similar lattice constant to rutile TiO2. Super-hydrophobicity after ultraviolet irradiation was then examined. Finally, the synthesized TiO2 array was peeled off and transferred onto a resin sheet. We determined that the substrate could be subjected to repeated hydrothermal synthesis, thereby demonstrating the reusability of the substrate. These results demonstrate the applicability of these processes for industrial applications.},

ABSTRACT = {Manufacturing companies are exposed to increased complexity and competition. To stay competitive, companies need to minimize the total cost of quality while ensuring high transparency about process–product relationships within the manufacturing system. In this context, the development of technologies such as advanced analytics and cyber physical production systems offer a promising approach. This paper discusses and defines essential elements of virtual quality gates in the context of manufacturing systems. To support the planning and implementation of virtual quality gates, a morphological box is developed which can be used to identify and derive an individual approach for a virtual quality gate based on the specific characteristics and requirements of the respective manufacturing system. Moreover, the framework is exemplified by three case studies from various industries and resulting potential are discussed.},

ABSTRACT = {In this work, two Ti-6Al-4V powder lots were produced using two different techniques: plasma atomization and gas atomization, with the first producing more spherical particles than the second. Testing specimens were then manufactured with these powder lots using an identical set of printing parameters and the same laser powder bed fusion system. Next, the porosity levels and distributions as well as the static and fatigue properties of the specimens from both powder lots were compared. Regarding the static mechanical properties, a noticeable difference was observed between the plasma-atomized powder specimens and their gas-atomized equivalents (7% greater ultimate and 4% greater yield strengths, but 3% lower elongation to failure, respectively). However, with regard to the fatigue resistance, the advantages of the plasma-atomized powder specimens in terms of their mechanical resistance were somewhat counterbalanced by the presence of pores aligned in the direction perpendicular to that of applied load. Conversely, specimens printed with the gas-atomized powder manifested a similar level of porosity, but a uniform pore distribution, which reduced the impact of the processing-induced porosity on fatigue cracks initiation and propagation.},

ABSTRACT = {The performance indicator, Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE), is one of the most important ones for production control, as it merges information of equipment usage, process yield, and product quality. The determination of the OEE is oftentimes not transparent in companies, due to the heterogeneous data sources and manual interference. Furthermore, there is a difference in present guidelines to calculate the OEE. Due to a big amount of sensor data in Cyber Physical Production Systems, Machine Learning methods can be used in order to detect several elements of the OEE by a trained model. Changeover time is one crucial aspect influencing the OEE, as it adds no value to the product. Furthermore, changeover processes are fulfilled manually and vary from worker to worker. They always have their own procedure to conduct a changeover of a machine for a new product or production lot. Hence, the changeover time as well as the process itself vary. Thus, a new Machine Learning based concept for identification and characterization of machine set-up actions is presented. Here, the issue to be dealt with is the necessity of human and machine interaction to fulfill the entire machine set-up process. Because of this, the paper shows the use case in a real production scenario of a small to medium size company (SME), the derived data set, promising Machine Learning algorithms, as well as the results of the implemented Machine Learning model to classify machine set-up actions.},

ABSTRACT = {Lean production principles have greatly contributed to the efficient and customer-oriented mass production of goods and services. A core element of lean production is the focus on cycle times and designing production controls and buffers around any bottlenecks in the system. Hence, a production line organized by lean principles will operate in a static or at least quasi-static way. While the individualization of products is an interesting business approach, it can influence cycle times and in-time production. This work demonstrates how performance losses induced by highly variable cycle times can be recovered using a digital twin. The unit under analysis is an industrial joiner’s workshop. Due to the high variance in cycle time, the joinery fails its production target, even if all machines are below 80% usage. Using a discrete event simulation of the production line, different production strategies can be evaluated efficiently and systematically. It is successfully shown that the performance losses due to the highly variable cycle times can be compensated using a digital twin in combination with optimization strategies. This is achieved by operating the system in a non-static mode, exploiting the flexibilities within the systems.},

ABSTRACT = {High average power (>50 W) nanosecond pulsed fiber lasers are now routinely available owing to the demand for high throughput laser applications. However, in some applications, scale-up in average power has a detrimental effect on process quality due to laser-induced thermal accumulation in the workpiece. To understand the laser–material interactions in this power regime, and how best to optimize process performance and quality, we investigated the influence of laser parameters such as pulse duration, energy dose (i.e., total energy deposited per unit area), and pulse repetition frequency (PRF) on engraving 316L stainless steel. Two different laser beam scanning strategies, namely, sequential method (SM) and interlacing method (IM), were examined. For each set of parameters, the material removal rate (MRR) and average surface roughness (Sa) were measured using an Alicona 3D surface profilometer. A phenomenological model has been used to help identify the best combination of laser parameters for engraving. Specifically, this study has found that (i) the model serves as a quick way to streamline parameters for area engraving (ii) increasing the pulse duration and energy dose at certain PRF results in a high MRR, albeit with an associated increase in Sa, and (iii) the IM offers 84% reduction in surface roughness at a higher MRR compared to SM. Ultimately, high quality at high throughput engraving is demonstrated using optimized process parameters.},

ABSTRACT = {Additive manufacturing (AM), also known as 3D printing, has gained significant interest due to the freedom it offers in creating complex-shaped and highly customized parts with little lead time. However, a current challenge of AM is the lack of geometric accuracy of fabricated parts. To improve the geometric accuracy of 3D printed parts, this paper presents a three-dimensional geometric compensation method that allows for eliminating systematic deviations by morphing the original surface mesh model of the part by the inverse of the systematic deviations. These systematic deviations are measured by 3D scanning multiple sacrificial printed parts and computing an average deviation vector field throughout the model. We demonstrate the necessity to filter out the random deviations from the measurement data used for compensation. Case studies demonstrate that printing the compensated mesh model based on the average deviation of five sacrificial parts produces a part with deviations about three times smaller than measured on the uncompensated parts. The deviation values of this compensated part based on the average deviation vector field are less than half of the deviation values of the compensated part based on only one sacrificial part.},

ABSTRACT = {Gas metal arc welding torches are commonly chosen based on their current-carrying capacity. It is known that the current-carrying capacity of welding torches under CO2 is usually higher than under argon dominated shielding gases. In this publication, the extent to which this can be attributed to the shielding gas dependent arc radiation is investigated. For this purpose, the influence of the shielding gas on the thermal load of the shielding gas nozzle of a GMAW torch was calorimetrically measured. These experiments were carried out for four different shielding gases (argon, CO2, and two argon/CO2 mixtures). The measurements were all performed at an average current of 300 A. The welding current was set by adjusting the wire feed rate or the voltage correction. For each case, a separate set of experiments was done. It is shown that the changed arc radiation resulting from the different shielding gases has an influence on the heat input into the gas nozzle, and thus into the torch. For the same shielding gas, this influence largely correlates with the welding voltage.},

ABSTRACT = {This study addresses the wet grinding of large stainless steel sheets, because it is difficult to subject them to dry grinding. Because stainless steel has a low thermal conductivity and a high coefficient of thermal expansion, it easily causes grinding burn and thermal deformation while dry grinding on the wheel without applying a cooling effect. Therefore, wet grinding is a better alternative. In this study, we made several types of grinding wheels, performed the wet grinding of stainless steel sheets, and identified the wheels most suitable for the process. As such, this study developed a special accessory that could be attached to a wet grinding workpiece. The attachment can maintain constant pressure, rotational speed, and supply grinding fluid during work. A set of experiments was conducted to see how some grinding wheels subjected to some grinding conditions affected the surface roughness of a workpiece made of a stainless steel sheet (SUS 304, according to Japanese Industrial Standards: JIS). It was found that the roughness of the sheet could be minimized when a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) grinding wheel was used as the grinding wheel and tap water was used as the grinding fluid at an attachment pressure of 0.2 MPa and a rotational speed of 150 rpm. It was shown that a surface roughness of up to 0.3 μm in terms of the arithmetic average height could be achieved if the above conditions were satisfied during wet grinding. The final surface roughness was 0.03 μm after finish polishing by buffing. Since the wet grinding of steel has yet to be studied in detail, this article will serve as a valuable reference.},

ABSTRACT = {The objective of this paper is to present a new hybrid additive manufacturing route for fabricating collector coins with complex, intricate contoured holes. The new manufacturing route combines metal deposition by additive manufacturing with metal cutting and forming, and its application is illustrated with an example consisting of a prototype coin made from stainless steel AISI 316L. Experimentation and finite element analysis of the coin minting operation with the in-house computer program i-form show that the blanks produced by additive manufacturing and metal cutting can withstand the high compressive pressures that are attained during the embossing and impressing of lettering and other reliefs on the coin surfaces. The presentation allows concluding that hybrid additive manufacturing opens the way to the production of innovative collector coins with geometric features that are radically different from those that are currently available in the market.},

ABSTRACT = {Many important physical phenomena are governed by intense mechanical shock and impulse. These can be used in material processing and manufacturing. Examples include the compaction or shearing of materials in ballistic, meteor, or other impacts, spallation in armor and impact to induce phase and residual stress changes. The traditional methods for measuring very high strain rate behavior usually include gas-guns that accelerate flyers up to km/s speeds over a distance of meters. The throughput of such experiments is usually limited to a few experiments per day and the equipment is usually large, requiring specialized laboratories. Here, a much more compact method based on the Vaporizing Foil Actuator (VFA) is used that can accelerate flyers to over 1 km/s over a few mm of travel is proposed for high throughput testing in a compact system. A system with this primary driver coupled with Photonic Doppler Velocimetry (PDV) is demonstrated to give insightful data in powder compaction allowing measurements of shock speed, spall testing giving fast and reasonable estimates of spall strength, and impact welding providing interface microstructure as a function of impact angle and speed. The essential features of the system are outlined, and it is noted that this approach can be extended to other dynamic tests as well.},

ABSTRACT = {Chatter vibrations arising during machining operations are detrimental for cutting process performance, since they may cause poor surface quality of the machined part and severe damages to machine tool elements. Passive approaches for chatter suppression are based on the integration of special mechanical components with high-damping properties within the machining system. They represent a good solution to this problem thanks to their intrinsic simplicity. Recently, the application of metallic lattice structures inside 3D printed parts obtained from the Selective Laser Melting technology have proven superior damping properties with respect to the same full density material. Here, this idea is further explored by considering the novel configuration where the unmelted powder grains are retained inside the lattice structure by an external shell, acting as a multiplicity of microscopic mechanical dampers. This concept is applied for passive chatter suppression of thin-walled parts that are of particular relevance for industry. Preliminary experimental investigation was first carried out on simple beam-like specimens, and then on thin-walled benchmarks that were identified through modal analysis and tested under real cutting conditions. The main conclusion is that the novel proposed configuration (lattice plus unmelted powder) has higher damping properties with respect to the full density and lattice alternatives. Accordingly, it may be successfully applied for passive chatter suppression in real machining operations.},

ABSTRACT = {The AA6082-T6 and AA5754-H22 aluminium alloys were selected as the base materials to fabricate similar and dissimilar friction stir lap welds. Three lap configurations, AA6082/AA5754, AA5754/AA6082 and AA6082/AA6082, were produced using three pin profiles and tested to analyse the role of the plastic behaviours of the base materials on the welding conditions. The macrostructural characterisation was carried out to understand the material flow response and hook defect formation. The mechanical characterisation of the joints was done by microhardness and lap tensile shear testing. The finite element analysis and phase simulation were conducted to predict the phase dissolution temperatures and the softening kinetics. The welding torque and axial forces registered were analysed to quantify differences in the alloy’s flowability during welding. The analysis of the welding machine outputs enabled to conclude that higher axial forces were registered when the AA5754 alloy was placed at the top of the dissimilar lap joint, showing that the non-heat-treatable alloy has lower flowability than the heat-treatable alloy. These results were associated with the flow-softening of the AA6082 alloy in plastic deformation at high temperatures. The coupled experimental and numerical analysis revealed that the plastic behaviour of the base materials strongly influenced the material flow and, in this way, the hook defect formation and the shear tensile properties of the welds.},

ABSTRACT = {In the process of metal cutting, the anti-wear performance of the tool determines the life of the tool and affects the surface quality of the workpiece. The finite element simulation method can directly show the tool wear state and morphology, but due to the limitations of the simulation time and complex boundary conditions, it has not been commonly used in tool life prediction. Based on this, a tool wear model was established on the platform of a finite element simulation software for the cutting process of titanium alloy TC4 by end milling. The key technique is to embed different types of tool wear models into the finite element model in combination with the consequent development technology. The effectiveness of the tool wear model was validated by comparing the experimental results with the simulation results. At the same time, in order to quickly predict the tool life, an empirical prediction formula of tool wear was established, and the change course of tool wear under time change was obtained.},

ABSTRACT = {Hot formed sheet components made of Martensitic Stainless Steels (MSS) can achieve ultra-high strengths in combination with very high corrosion resistance. This enables to manufacture complex lightweight sheet components with longer lifespan. Nevertheless, the hot formability of MSS sheets has not been accurately evaluated considering high temperatures and complex stress and strain states. In this work, the hot sheet formability of three MSS alloys under thermomechanical process conditions was investigated. Initially, mechanical properties of this sheet material were determined by uniaxial tensile test. Finite Element Method (FEM) simulation of a hot deep drawing process was performed under consideration of thermo physical calculated material models using the software JMatPro® and Simufact Forming® 15.0. The resulting strains and cooling rates developed locally in the work piece during the forming process were estimated. The numerical results were validated experimentally. Round cups were manufactured by hot deep drawing process. The resulting maximum drawing depth and hardness were measured. In general, all three alloys developed very good formability at forming temperatures between 700 and 900 °C and increased hardness values. However, they are highly susceptible to chemical composition, austenitization temperature, dwell time, and flange gap. A statistic approach is given to explain the correlation between hardness and its influencing factors.},

ABSTRACT = {The semi-solid-metal 6063 aluminum alloy was developed for the automotive industry. The objective of this research was to optimize parameters in friction stir welding process that can provide the highest tensile strength. The ANOVA factorial design was used to analyze rotation speed, welding speed, and tool geometry at different factor levels of experimentation. The results showed that the optimized tensile strength was 120.7 MPa from the cylindrical tool, rotation speed was from 1300 to 2100 rpm, and welding speed less than 75 mm/min in the coefficient of determination R2 was 95.09%, as can be considered from the regression equation. The examination of the stir-zone and thermal mechanical affected zone using SEM and EDX showed that the new recrystallization of the microstructure causes fine grain in the stir-zone, coarse grain in advancing-side thermal mechanical affected zone, and equiaxed grain in the retracting-side thermal-mechanical affect zone. The intermetallic compounds of β-Al5FeSi phase transformation phase were formed to three types, i.e., β″-Al5Fe, Mg2Si, and Al8Fe2Si phase were observed. Moreover, in the stir-zone and thermal-mechanical-affected zone, defects were found such as flash defects, void or cavity defects, crack defects, lack of penetration defects, tunnel defects, kissing bond defects, and dendrite formation defects affecting weldability.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper describes the difficult machinability of nickel titanium alloy (NiTi alloy) and its mechanism. As a result of examining the difficult cutting machinability via a turning experiment, NiTi alloy cutting showed larger cutting force, higher cutting temperature, and severe tool wear with plastic deformation of the tool compared to Ti-6Al-4V. In addition, the discharged chips were tangled with the jaw chuck and the cutting tool. As a result of investigating the cause of these difficult machining properties by orthogonal cutting, it was found that the progression of severe flank wear is affected by the elastic recovery due to the super elasticity of the material. The verification of the results according to the shear plane theory suggest that the large deformation resistance of the material is the cause of the increase in cutting temperature. Furthermore, because the cutting temperature exceeds the shape memory transformation temperature, the generated chips are shape memory processed. It was also found that because the generated chips are super elastic, chips are not easily broken and they are lengthened, and are easily entangled with a cutting tool and a jaw chuck.},

ABSTRACT = {In order to ensure high productivity capabilities of machine tools at a low cost but at increased geometric accuracy, modeling of their static and dynamic behavior is a crucial task in structure optimization. The drive control and the frictional forces acting in feed axes significantly determine the machine’s response in the frequency domain. The aim of this study was the accurate modeling and the experimental investigation of dynamic damping effects using a machine tool test rig with three-axis kinematics. For this purpose, an order-reduced finite element model of the mechanical structure was coupled with models of the drive control and of the non-linear friction behavior. In order to validate the individual models, a new actuator system based on a tubular linear drive was used for frequency response measurements during uniaxial carriage movements. A comparison of the dynamic measurements with the simulation results revealed a good match of amplitudes in the frequency domain by considering dynamic damping. Accordingly, the overall dynamic behavior of machine tool structures can be predicted and thus optimized by a coupled simulation at higher level of detail and by considering the damping effects of friction. Dynamic testing with the newly designed actuator is a prerequisite for model validation and control drive parameterization.},

ABSTRACT = {Milling tools with a large length–diameter ratio are widely applied in machining structural features with deep depth. However, their high dynamic flexibility gives rise to chatter vibrations, which results in poor surface finish, reduced productivity, and even tool damage. With a passive tuned mass damper (TMD) embedded inside the arbor, a large length–diameter ratio milling tool with chatter-resistance ability was developed. By modeling the milling tool as a continuous beam, the tool-tip frequency response function (FRF) of the milling tool with TMD was derived using receptance coupling substructure analysis (RCSA), and the gyroscopic effect of the rotating tool was incorporated. The TMD parameters were optimized numerically with the consideration of mounting position based on the maximum cutting stability criterion, followed by the simulation of the effectiveness of the optimized and detuned TMD. With the tool-tip FRF obtained, the chatter stability of the milling process was predicted. Tap tests showed that the TMD was able to increase the minimum real part of the FRF by 79.3%. The stability lobe diagram (SLD) was predicted, and the minimum critical depth of cut in milling operations was enhanced from 0.10 to 0.46 mm.},

ABSTRACT = {While deep drawing of sheet metals is economical at high volumes, it can be very costly for manufacturing prototypes, mainly due to high tooling costs. Additively manufactured polymer tools have the potential to be more cost-efficient for small series, but they are softer and thus less resilient than conventional steel tools. This work aimed to study the dimensional precision of such tools using a standard cup geometry. Tools were printed with FFF using two different materials, PLA and CF-PA. A test series of 20 parts was drawn from each tool. Afterwards, the dimensional precisions of the drawn parts were analyzed using an optical measuring system. The achieved dimensional accuracy of the first drawn cup using the PLA toolset was 1.98 mm, which was further improved to 1.04 mm by altering shrinkage and springback allowances. The repeatability of the deep drawing process for the CF-reinforced PA tool was 0.17 mm during 20 drawing operations and better than that of the PLA tool (1.17 mm). To conclude, deep drawing of standard cups is doable using direct polymer additive tooling with a dimensional accuracy of 1.04 mm, which can be further improved by refining allowances incorporated to the CAD model being printed.},

ABSTRACT = {In this work, the manufacture of thin walls with sharp corners has been optimized by adjusting the limits of a 3-axis cartesian kinematics through data recorded and analyzed off-line, such as axis speed, acceleration and the positioning of the X and Y axes. The study was carried out with two powder materials (SS316L and IN718) using the directed energy deposition process with laser. Thin walls were obtained with 1 mm thickness and only one bead per layer and straight/sharp corners at 90°. After adjusting the in-position parameter G502 for positioning precision on the FAGOR 8070 CNC system, it has been possible to obtain walls with minimal accumulation of material in the corner, and with practically constant layer thickness and height, with a radii of internal curvature between 0.11 and 0.24 mm for two different precision configuration. The best results have been obtained by identifying the correct balance between the decrease in programmed speed and the precision in the positioning to reach the point defined as wall corner, with speed reductions of 29% for a programmed speed of 20 mm/s and 61% for a speed of 40 mm/s. The walls show minimal defects such as residual porosities, and the microstructure is adequate.},

ABSTRACT = {Equal-channel angular pressing (ECAP) is known to induce significant grain refinement and formation of tangled dislocations within the grains. These are induced to evolve to form low-angle boundaries (i.e., cell boundaries) and eventually high-angle boundaries (i.e., grain boundaries). On the other hand, the precipitation sequence of age hardening aluminum alloys can be significantly affected by pre-straining and severe plastic deformation. Thus, ECAP is expected to influence the T6 response of aluminum alloys. In this study, a complex Al-Cu-Mg-Li-Ag-Zr-Sc alloy was subjected to ECAP following different straining paths. The alloy was ECAP at 460 K via route A, C, and by forward-backward route A (FB-route A) up to four passes. That is, ECAP was carried out imposing billet rotation between passes (route A), billet rotation by +90° between passes (route C), and billet rotation by +90° and inversion upside down between passes (FB-route A). The alloy was also aged at 460 K for different durations after ECAP. TEM microstructure inspections showed a marked influence of the different shearing deformations induced by ECAP on the alloy aging response. The precipitation kinetics of the different hardening secondary phases were affected by shearing deformation and tangled dislocations. In particular, the T1-Al2CuLi phase was the one that mostly showed a precipitation sequence speed up induced by the tangled dislocations formed during ECAP. The T1 phase was found to grow with aging time according to the Lifshitz-Slyozov-Wagner low-power regime.},

ABSTRACT = {The present study proposes an integrated prediction model for both shearing and ploughing constants for the peripheral milling of Inconel 718 by using a preidentified mean normal friction coefficient. An equation is presented for the identification of normal mean friction angle of oblique cutting in milling. A simplified oblique cutting model is adopted for obtaining the shear strain and shearing constants for a tool of given helix angle, radial rake angle, and honed edge radius. The shearing and ploughing constants predicted from analytical model using the Merchant’s shear angle formula and the shear flow stress from the selected Johnson–Cook material law are shown to be consistent with the experimental results. The experimentally identified normal friction angles and shearing and edge ploughing constants for the Inconel 718 milling process are demonstrated to have approximately constant values irrespective of the average chip thickness. Moreover, the predicted forces obtained in milling aged Inconel 718 alloy are in good agreement with the experimental force measurements reported in the literature. Without considering the thermal–mechanical coupling effect in the material law, the presented model is demonstrated to work well for milling of both annealed and aged Inconel 718.},

ABSTRACT = {Additive manufacturing is typically a flexible alternative to conventional manufacturing processes. However, manufacturing costs increase due to the effort required to experimentally determine optimum process parameters for customized products or small batches. Therefore, simulation models are needed in order to reduce the amount of effort necessary for experimental testing. For this purpose, a novel technological simulation method for directed energy deposition additive manufacturing is presented here. The Dexel-based simulation allows modeling of additive manufacturing of varying geometric shapes by considering multi-axis machine tool kinematics and local process conditions. The simulation approach can be combined with the simulation of subtractive processes, which enables integrated digital process chains.},

ABSTRACT = {In recent years, increasing automotive safety by improving crashworthiness has been a focal point in the automotive industry, employing high-strength steel such as press hardenable steel (PHS). In addition to the improved strength of individual parts in the body of the vehicle, the strength of the resistance-spot-welded joints of these parts is highly important to obtain a safe structure. In general, dimensions of weld nuggets are regarded as one of the criteria for the quality of spot-welded joints. In the presented research, a three-dimensional axisymmetric finite element model is developed to predict the nugget formation in resistance spot welding (RSW) of two types of PHS: the uncoated and AlSi-coated 1.8 mm boron steel after hot stamping. A fully coupled electro-thermo-mechanical analysis was conducted using the commercial software package Abaqus. The FE predicted weld nugget development is compared with experimental results. The computed weld nugget sizes show good agreement with experimental values.},

ABSTRACT = {Ultraprecision machining is required in many advanced fields. To create precise parts for realizing their high performance, the whole machining process is usually conducted on the same ultraprecision machine tool to avoid setting errors by reducing setting operations. However, feed rate is relatively slow and machining efficiency is not so high compared to ordinary machine tools. Thus, the study aims to develop an efficient ultraprecision machining system including an industrial robot to avoid manual setting and to automate the setting operations. In this system, ultraprecision machining is conducted for the workpiece having a shape near the target shape, which is beforehand prepared by ordinary machine tools and is located on the machine table by means of an industrial robot. Since the setting errors of the roughly machined workpiece deteriorate machining accuracy, the differences from the ideal position and attitude are detected with a contact type of on-machine measurement device. Numerical control (NC) data is finally modified to compensate the identified workpiece setting errors to machine the target shape on an ultraprecision machine tool. From the experimental results, it is confirmed that the proposed system has the possibility to reduce time required in ultraprecision machining to create precise parts with high efficiency.},

ABSTRACT = {In recent years, the use of highly functional optical elements has made its way into our everyday life. Its applications range from use in utility items such as cell phone cameras up to security elements on banknotes or production goods. For this purpose, the Leibniz Institute for Materials Engineering (IWT) has been developing a cutting process for the fast and cost-effective production of hologram-based diffractive optical elements. In contrast to established non-mechanical manufacturing processes, such as laser lithography or chemical etching, which are able to produce optics in large quantities and with high accuracy, the diamond turning approach is extending these properties by offering several degrees of freedom. This allows for an almost unlimited geometric complexity and a structured area of considerable size (several tenth square millimeters), achieved in a single process step. In order to introduce diffractive security features to the mass market and to actual production goods, a high-performance replication process is required as the consecutive development step. Micro injection molding represents a feasible and promising option here. In particular, diamond machining enables the integration of safety features directly into the mold insert. Not only does this make additional assembly obsolete, but the safety feature can also be placed inconspicuously in the final product. In this paper, the potential of micro-injection molding as a replication process for diffractive structured surfaces will be investigated and demonstrated. Furthermore, the optical functionality after replication will be verified and evaluated.},

The high-intensity interaction of laser radiation on the film–glass interface allowed us to develop a process for efficient glass bump formation. The high peak energy of the picosecond pulses has allowed us to merge the processes of coating evaporation and bubble growth into one. A parameter window was established within which efficient bump formation can be achieved. Well-defined spherical structures with a height up to 60 μm and a diameter up to 250 μm were obtained at pulse energy Epulse = 2.5 ÷ 4 μJ and laser fluence F = 2.5–0.41 J/cm2). The key aspects of the bump formation process were studied and are explained.},

ABSTRACT = {Biomass–fungi biocomposite materials are derived from sustainable sources and can biodegrade at the end of their service. They can be used to manufacture products that are traditionally made from petroleum-based plastics. There are potential applications for these products in the packaging, furniture, and construction industries. In the biomass–fungi biocomposite materials, the biomass particles (made from agricultural waste such as hemp hurd) act as the substrate, and a network of fungal hyphae grow through and bind the biomass particles together. Typically, molding-based methods are used to manufacture products using these biocomposite materials. Recently, the authors reported a novel extrusion-based 3D printing method using these biocomposite materials. This paper reports a follow-up investigation into the effects of mixing parameters (mixing time and mixing mode) on fungal growth in biomass–fungi mixtures prepared for 3D printing and the effects of printing parameters (printing speed and extrusion pressure) on fungal growth in printed samples. The fungal growth was quantified using the number of fungal colonies that grew from samples. The results show that, when mixing time increased from 15 to 120 s, there was a 52% increase in fungal growth. Changing from continuous to intermittent mixing mode resulted in an 11% increase in fungal growth. Compared to mixtures that were not subjected to printing, samples printed with a high printing speed and high extrusion pressure had a 14.6% reduction in fungal growth, while those with a low printing speed and low extrusion pressure resulted in a 16.5% reduction in fungal growth.},

ABSTRACT = {Incremental sheet forming (ISF) is an advanced flexible manufacturing process to produce complex 3D products. Unlike the conventional stamping process, ISF does not require any high cost dedicated dies. However, numerical computation for large-size ISF processes is time-consuming, and its accuracy for spring back due to unclamping tools after ISF cannot satisfy industrial demand. In this paper, an advanced numerical model considering complicated forming tool paths, trimming, and spring back was developed to efficiently simulate the multi-stage deformation phenomena of incremental sheet forming processes. Numerical modeling accuracy and efficiency are investigated considering the influence of tool path, material properties of the blank, mesh size, and boundary conditions. Through a series of case studies and comparisons with experimental results, it is observed that the numerical model with kinematics material properties and a moderate element size (5 mm) may reproduce the deformation characteristics of ISF with good accuracy and can obtain practical efficiency for a large-size ISF part.},

ABSTRACT = {Wire and arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) is a metal deposition technique with a fast rate and the possibility of a high volume of deposition. Because of its fast deposition and high heat input, the manufactured products have poor surface quality. This paper presents a study on the machining of Inconel 718 wall-shaped additive manufacturing (AM) products, a necessary step for the improvement of surface quality. Considering the possibility that the characteristics of the milling processes of AM products might differ from those of traditionally manufactured parts, in this research, two types of Inconel 718 were studied and compared: one was manufactured using WAAM, and the other was an Inconel 718 rolled bar (Aerospace Material Specifications 5662). Using the testing procedure, a conventional two-flute cutting tool was used to assess their machinability. For this process, multiple passes were performed at three different heights of the samples. Considering the peculiarities of the AM products, such as their uneven surfaces, dendritic microstructures, and anisotropy, the results were analyzed. After the machining operation, the effects on the products were also studied by analyzing their surface quality. This study found a higher stability in the cutting process for the AMS 5662 samples relative to the WAAM parts with less variability in the cutting forces overall, resulting in better surface quality.},

ABSTRACT = {Tailoring the properties of hot-stamped components offers the potential to enhance crash performance while simultaneously improving downstream joining processes. In recent years, an innovative technology suited for achieving tailored properties involving the utilization of a specialized furnace chamber, known as the TemperBox®, has been introduced. Within this chamber, a cooled aluminum mask shields specific areas of the blank from incoming heat radiation and concurrently absorbs the blank’s own radiation. The duration of the heat radiation exchange can influence the diffusion-dependent phase transformation and, consequently, the resulting mechanical properties. Hence, the intermediate cooling duration assumes a pivotal role as a parameter, as is investigated in this study. To examine the effects, specimens of the steel 22MnB5 AS150 are subjected to intermediate cooling of varying durations, followed by forming and partial quenching. The temperature profile of the blank during intermediate cooling prior to forming and quenching is analyzed. Subsequently, the tailored hot-stamped components are assessed for hardness, strength, ductility, and thickness strain. The study reveals that with increasing duration of partial intermediate cooling and targeted radiation exchange, a homogeneous ferritic–pearlitic structure is formed from an austenitic structure. This uniform structure of ferrite and pearlite is reflected in lower hardness and strength values, along with improved ductility. Additionally, this paper introduces a simulation methodology designed to calculate the dynamics of thermal radiation and the kinetics of phase transformation.},

ABSTRACT = {Ferritic stainless steel (FSS) is widely used to manufacture deep-drawn products for corrosion resistance applications, being the alloy drawability strongly affected by its microstructural anisotropy. This study combines a variety of microscopy techniques enabling in-depth analyses of the microstructural evolution of two different FSSs correlated to their deep drawing performance. One of the steels has a good correspondence with the standard EN-1.4016 (AISI 430). The other is a modified version of the previous one with higher contents of the ferrite-stabilising elements Si and Cr, and lower contents of the austenite-stabilising elements C, N, and Mn. Electron Backscatter Diffraction results confirm that the microstructural properties and drawability of FSS in the deep drawing process are improved in the modified steel version. Scanning transmission electron microscopy under low-angle annular dark field conditions evidences that the deformation mechanism of FSS during deep drawing follows a microstructural distortion model based on the grain size gradient and shows a variation of the deformation texture depending on the alloy composition. This work demonstrates the potential of advanced microscopy techniques for optimising the processing and design of ferritic stainless steels, with slight variations in the alloy composition, for deep drawing applications.},

ABSTRACT = {Low performance is considered one of the main drawbacks of laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) technology. In the present work, the effect of the AlSi10Mg powder layer thickness on the laser melting process was investigated to improve the LPBF building rate. A high-fidelity simulation of the melt pool formation was performed for different thicknesses of the powder bed using the Kintech Simulation Software for Additive Manufacturing (KiSSAM, version cd8e01d) developed by the authors. The powder bed after the recoating operation was obtained by the discrete element method. The laser energy deposition on the powder particles and the substrate was simulated by ray tracing. For the validation of the model, an experimental analysis of single tracks was performed on two types of substrates. The first substrate was manufactured directly with LPBF technology, while the second was cast. The simulation was carried out for various combinations of process parameters, predominantly with a high energy input, which provided a sufficient remelting depth. The calculations revealed the unstable keyhole mode appearance associated with the low absorptivity of the aluminum alloy at a scanning speed of 300 mm/s for all levels of the laser power (325–375 W). The results allowed formulating the criteria for the lack of fusion emerging during LPBF with an increased layer thickness. This work is expected to provide a scientific basis for the analysis of the maximum layer thickness via simulation to increase the performance of the technology.},

ABSTRACT = {Multi-Material Jetting (MMJ) is an additive manufacturing process empowering the printing of ceramics and hard metals with the highest precision. Given great advantages, it also poses challenges in ensuring the repeatability of part quality due to an inherent broader choice of built strategies. The addition of advanced quality assurance methods can therefore benefit the repeatability of part quality for widespread adoption. In particular, quality defects caused by improperly configured droplet overlap parameterizations, despite droplets themselves being well parameterized, constitute a major challenge for stable process control. This publication deals with the automated classification of the adequacy of process parameterization on green parts based on in-line surface measurements and their processing with machine learning methods, in particular the training of convolutional neural networks. To generate the training data, a demo part structure with eight layers was printed with different overlap settings, scanned, and labeled by process engineers. In particular, models with two convolutional layers and a pooling size of (6, 6) appeared to yield the best accuracies. Models trained only with images of the first layer and without the infill edge obtained validation accuracies of 90%. Consequently, an arbitrary section of the first layer is sufficient to deliver a prediction about the quality of the subsequently printed layers.},

ABSTRACT = {Manufacturing structural monolithic components for the aerospace market often involves machining distortion, which entails high costs and material and energy waste in industry. Despite the development of distortion calculation and avoidance tools, this issue remains unsolved due to the difficulties in accurately and economically measuring the residual stresses of the machining blanks. In the last years, the on-machine layer removal method has shown its potential for industrial implementation, offering the possibility to obtain final components from blanks with measured residual stresses. However, this measuring method requires too long an implementation time to be used in-process as part of the manufacturing chains. In this sense, the objective of this paper is to provide a machining distortion prediction method based on bulk residual stress estimation and hybrid modelling. The bulk residual stresses estimation is performed using reduced layer removal measurements. Considering bulk residual stress data and machining-induced residual stress data, as well as geometry and material data, real-part distortion calculations can be performed. For this, a hybrid model based on the combination of an analytical formulation and finite element modelling is employed, which enables us to perform fast and accurate calculations. With the developments here presented, the machining distortion can be predicted, and its uncertainty range can be calculated, in a simple and fast way. The accuracy and practicality of these developments are evaluated by comparison with the experimental results, showing the capability of the proposed solution in providing distortion predictions with errors lower than 10% in comparison with the experimental results.},

ABSTRACT = {The surface mechanical properties of thermoplastics are crucially important for evaluating molded products’ vulnerability to scratching. Because surface mechanical properties reflect material performance directly in terms of durability and frictional behavior, understanding and modeling them is important for industry and research. This emphasizes the surface mechanical properties of Vickers hardness and the static friction coefficient, with attempts to model them as functions of stress at yield initiation. Vickers hardness can be related to the compressive stress at yield initiation. The static friction coefficient can be modeled as a function of the surface shear strength and Vickers hardness. This research has improved our understanding of thermoplastics’ surface mechanical properties and has enabled the prediction of the scratch performance of molded products and the provision of effective indicators for material design.},

ABSTRACT = {The automation of the manufacturing processes of thermoplastic composite laminates has become dependent on open mold processes such as automated tape placement (ATP), which couples tape layering with in situ consolidation. The manufacturing parameters of ATP open mold processes, which comprise processing time, consolidation pressure and temperature, affect the bond strength between the plies and the quality of the laminates produced. Therefore, the effect of the manufacturing parameters should be characterized. This work experimentally evaluates the feasibility of fabricating thermoplastic laminates using an open mold process that reasonably models that of ATP. Glass fiber-reinforced polypropylene laminates are fabricated from unidirectional tapes under different consolidation periods, pressures, and temperatures. The bond quality in the produced laminates is assessed by measuring their interlaminar shear strength, which is measured using a short beam standardized shear test in conjunction with digital image correlation. Results show that consolidation can occur at temperatures slightly below the composite tapes’ complete melting temperature, and consolidation times between 7 and 13 min can result in acceptable bond strengths. The results confirmed the feasibility of the process and highlighted its limitations. Analysis of variance and machine learning showed that the effect of process parameters on interlaminar shear strength is nonlinear.},

ABSTRACT = {Context—Rapidly solidified aluminium alloy (RSA 443) is increasingly used in the manufacturing of optical mold inserts because of its fine nanostructure, relatively low cost, excellent thermal properties, and high hardness. However, RSA 443 is challenging for single-point diamond machining because the high silicon content mitigates against good surface finishes. Objectives—The objectives were to investigate multiple different ways to optimize the process parameters for optimal surface roughness on diamond-turned aluminium alloy RSA 443. The response surface equation was used as input to three different artificial intelligence tools, namely genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and differential evolution (DE), which were then compared. Results—The surface roughness machinability of RSA443 in single-point diamond turning was primarily determined by cutting speed, and secondly, cutting feed rate, with cutting depth being less important. The optimal conditions for the best surface finish Ra = 14.02 nm were found to be at the maximum rotational speed of 3000 rpm, cutting feed rate of 4.84 mm/min, and depth of cut of 14.52 µm with optimizing error of 3.2%. Regarding optimization techniques, the genetic algorithm performed best, then differential evolution, and finally particle swarm optimization. Originality—The study determines optimal diamond machining parameters for RSA 443, and identifies the superiority of GA above PSO and DE as optimization methods. The principles have the potential to be applied to other materials (e.g., in the RSA family) and machining processes (e.g., turning, milling).},

ABSTRACT = {This study addresses the effects of densification at varied pelletization temperatures on the novel Malaysian Khaya senegalensis wood-derived pellets biomass fuel characteristics. The lack of comprehensive understanding regarding the biomass fuel characteristics of this species prompted the research. By addressing this knowledge gap, this study explores the impact of temperature variations on key fuel properties, contributing to the optimization of sustainable biomass fuel production in manufacturing and materials processing. Khaya senegalensis wood, grown and harvested in Malaysia, was pelletized at different temperatures to analyze the calorific value, volatile matter content, ash content, fixed carbon, bulk density, and moisture contents of the pellets. The experimental data revealed a significant relationship between temperature and these fuel properties. Pelletizing at 75 °C produced the highest calorific value of 19.47 MJ/kg and the maximum fixed carbon content of 10.04%. A low ash level of 4.26% was achieved via pelletizing at 75 °C. According to the results, 75 °C produced the best thermophysical properties. These findings provide valuable understanding of how pelletization temperature influences fuel pellet thermophysical properties, a critical aspect in optimizing fuel pellet production, storage, advancing renewable energy resource utilization, and, finally, promoting a cleaner and more sustainable energy future.},

ABSTRACT = {Additive manufacturing of plastic components in medical technology enables greater freedom of design when designing patient-specific products, in particular, in production of customised medical products, such as orthoses. In the present contribution, the advantages of a digital process chain are combined, from the 3D scan of the patient to CAD-supported modelling of the corrective form and the orthosis design until the path planning of a printable geometry. The main disadvantages of current additive printing techniques, such as the fused filament fabrication (FFF) process, are high printing times (>12 h) for larger components as well as the low degree of freedom in the 2.5D printing technique that prevent the subsequent application of geometry features to the product. The fast SEAMHex (Screw Extrusion Additive Manufacturing) printing technology with a hexapod kinematic printing bed provides a solution to the mentioned difficulties. Consequently, the high-performance printer has been prepared for the individual requirements of medical technology in terms of materials and geometries. An effective additive manufacturing process has been realised and tested in combination with a digital process chain for orthosis modelling.},
