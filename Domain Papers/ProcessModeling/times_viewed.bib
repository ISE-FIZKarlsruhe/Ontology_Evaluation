ABSTRACT = {Prosumer (producing consumer)-based desktop additive manufacturing has been enabled by the recent radical reduction in 3-D printer capital costs created by the open-source release of the self-replicating rapid prototype (RepRap). To continue this success, there have been some efforts to improve reliability, which are either too expensive or lacked automation. A promising method to improve reliability is to use computer vision, although the success rates are still too low for widespread use. To overcome these challenges an open source low-cost reliable real-time optimal monitoring platform for 3-D printing from double cameras is presented here. This error detection system is implemented with low-cost web cameras and covers 360 degrees around the printed object from three different perspectives. The algorithm is developed in Python and run on a Raspberry Pi3 mini-computer to reduce costs. For 3-D printing monitoring in three different perspectives, the systems are tested with four different 3-D object geometries for normal operation and failure modes. This system is tested with two different techniques in the image pre-processing step: SIFT and RANSAC rescale and rectification, and non-rescale and rectification. The error calculations were determined from the horizontal and vertical magnitude methods of 3-D reconstruction images. The non-rescale and rectification technique successfully detects the normal printing and failure state for all models with 100% accuracy, which is better than the single camera set up only. The computation time of the non-rescale and rectification technique is two times faster than the SIFT and RANSAC rescale and rectification technique.},

ABSTRACT = {Direct Metal Deposition (DMD) is an additive manufacturing (AM) process capable of producing large components using a layer by layer deposition of molten powder. DMD is increasingly investigated due to its higher deposition rate and the possibility to produce large structural components specifically for the aerospace industry. During fabrication, a complex thermal history is experienced in different regions of the workpiece, depending on the process parameters and part geometry. The thermal history induces residual stress accumulation in the buildup, which is the main cause of distortions. In order to control the process and enhance the product quality, the understanding of the workpiece temperature is substantial. In this study, two methods to predict temperature evolution during the DMD process are introduced based on analytical and finite element methods. The objective is to compare these methods to experimental results and to provide more insights about their capabilities to predict accurately the temperature gradient, the cooling rate, and the melt pool geometry. A comparison of the computational time is also provided. Based on the results of the investigation, It appears that the analytical method provides an effective and accurate method to understand the influence of the process on the workpiece temperature.},

ABSTRACT = {Advanced high-strength steel (AHSS) is subject to a high deformation in geometry due to spring-back and high forces during forming. Therefore, dieless single-point incremental forming supported by induction heating was introduced. When a HCT980C steel part was studied, it was observed that the geometrical accuracy increased by forming using a 15 kW induction power, whereas a high deviation in profile geometry was observed by forming using a 5 kW induction power. The forming forces decreased by 66.63% compared with those resulting from forming at room temperature. At the same time, the HCT980C steel part cracked and failed to reach its designed depth when forming at room temperature. Regulating the tensile strength and hardness of the formed part and preventing their reduction was achieved by increasing the feed rate continuously as a function of the formed part’s growing depth. Moreover, the distribution of the induction heating temperature was reduced by introducing the new forming strategy. A cone wall angle of 70° was flexibly formed from a HCT980C steel sheet when the new strategy was applied.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper presents a new numerical approach for modelling the 3D printing process of fibre reinforced polymer composites by fused deposition modelling (FDM). The approach is based on the coupling between two particle methods, namely smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) and discrete element method (DEM). The coupled SPH-DEM model has distinctive advantages in dealing with the free surface flow, large deformation of fibres, and/or fibre-fibre interaction that are involved in the FDM process. A numerical feasibility study is carried out to demonstrate its capability for both short and continuous fibre reinforced polymer composites, with promising results achieved for the rheological flow and fibre orientation and deformation.},

ABSTRACT = {Under the support of an SBIR Phase II/IIB grant from the National Science Foundation, OMAX has developed and commercialized micro abrasive (µAWJ), culminating A MicroMAX® JetMachining® Center technology for meso-micro machining. AWJ inherently possesses technological and manufacturing merits unmatched by most machine tools. With the commercialization of µAWJ technology, waterjet is now fully capable of multi-mode machining most materials from macro to micro scales (the 7M advantage). Novel accessories and software facilitate machining precision 2D and 3D parts with a wide range of part size and thickness. The versatile waterjet is particularly advantageous for machining difficult and delicate materials, such as alloys, hardened steel, composites, and laminates. One unique capability is machining composites and nanomaterials comprised of metals (reflective and conductive), non-metals (non-conductive), and anything in between. The 7M advantage of waterjet has been taking advantage by machining sample parts made of a variety of advanced materials that are difficult, or even impossible, to machine otherwise.},

ABSTRACT = {Punching processes are widely used for producing automobile parts, mechanical components, and other parts. To produce highly accurate parts, it is important to estimate the ratio of the sheared surface to the cut surface. Many researchers have applied the finite-element method (FEM) to analyze the ratio of the sheared surface to the fracture surface on cut surfaces by using ductile fracture criteria. However, it is difficult to determine the fracture criteria on the cut surface by tensile tests or bending tests because the punching process involves many complicated steps. In this study, FEM was applied to the punching process to determine the values of critical fracture criteria (C) by using the ductile fracture criteria proposed by Cockcroft and Latham, Oyane, and Ayada. The ductile fracture criteria were compared with the boundary between the shear surface and the fracture surfaces using experiments performed with a simple punching system. The values of the ductile fracture criteria for the fracture initiation of the formed cut surface were predicted under various clearances between the punch and the die with various punch diameters. The influence of stress triaxiality and the effect of punch diameter on the sheared surface length are also discussed.},

ABSTRACT = {The main aim of this work was to evaluate the influence and optimize the factors of the TIG-MIG/MAG hybrid welding process on the geometry of the weld bead. An experimental design using the Taguchi methodology (robust design method) was used to conduct the experiments. The experiments were carried out according to an orthogonal matrix with 27 experiments, with three replicates each, totaling 81 test specimens. The factors (MIG/MAG shielding gas type, MIG/MAG voltage, MIG/MAG wire feed, gas flow rate of TIG, electric current intensity of TIG and welding speed) were varied with three levels each. Penetration, heat-affected zone (HAZ), bead width and bead height were the response variables analyzed. The results showed that the penetration was significantly influenced by the MIG/MAG wire feed, MIG/MAG shielding gas type, MIG/MAG voltage and welding speed. The HAZ has been influenced by MIG/MAG voltage, MIG/MAG shielding gas type, welding speed and electric current intensity of TIG. All factors had effects on the width, except the MIG/MAG wire feed. The bead height was significantly influenced by the MIG/MAG wire feed and by the electric current intensity of TIG. Optimizing the process was performed, so that for each output variable, the values of the factors that should be used were indicated, and the optimization was confirmed by welding test specimens.},

ABSTRACT = {In the present study, the mesostructure of a fused deposition modeling (FDM) processed part is considered for the investigation of its mechanical behavior. The layers of FDM printed part behave as a unidirectional fiber reinforced laminae, which are treated as an orthotropic material. The finite element (FE) procedure to find elastic moduli of a layer of the FDM processed part is presented. The mesostructure of the part that would be obtained from the process is replicated in FE models in order to find stiffness matrix of a layer. Two distinctive architectures of mesostructure are considered in the study to predict the mechanical behavior of the parts. Also, influences of layer thickness, road shape and air gap on the elastic properties of a material are investigated. Further, the parts fabricated with FDM process are treated as laminate structures. From the numerical results, it is seen that the elastic moduli are governed by mesostructures. Our laminate results are validated with experimental to demonstrate the use of classical laminate theory (CLT) for FDM parts. The elastic moduli (E1, E2, G12, ν12) of a layer used in the analysis are calculated from FE simulations. This study establishes relationship between mesostructure and macro mechanical properties of the part.},

ABSTRACT = {The need to manufacture a copy of a mechanical part typically arises when a single replacement part is necessary and is out of stock or out of production altogether. For parts with intricate details and associated accuracy requirements, investment casting may be preferred to machining, for size and detail reasons, or 3D printing, for material reasons. This work applies the digital manufacturing paradigm to one-off vacuum-aided rapid investment casting focusing on the process chain rather than on engineering issues. 3D laser scanning, digital model construction by surface fitting, casting model making by exploiting additive manufacturing, material investigation using scanning electron microscopy, casting simulation exploring process parameter scenarios, as well as the corresponding implementation on a vacuum casting machine are the pertinent interlinked steps and techniques. The added value of this work is that for each process link the important steps and the potential pitfalls are analyzed in detail using as an example a cylinder liner from a model car engine. Quality of the result was quite acceptable, the main benefit of the streamlined approach being that “right-first-time” parts can be achieved.},

ABSTRACT = {Rotary ultrasonic machining (RUM) is a nontraditional and cost-effective machining method for hard and brittle materials, such as ceramics, optical glass, composite materials, and so on. RUM is a hybrid process that combines the material removal mechanisms of diamond abrasive grinding and ultrasonic machining. In RUM, a rotating cutting tool with metal-bonded diamond abrasive particles is ultrasonically vibrated in the axial direction while the tool spindle is fed toward the workpiece at a constant feedrate to remove material. It has been reported that continuous rotary ultrasonic machining has been successfully used to drill holes in K9 glass. Intermittent rotary ultrasonic machining is a newly introduced ultrasonic machining process, which uses a slotted cutting tool instead of a common metal bonded diamond cutting tool as used in continuous rotary ultrasonic machining. There has been no reported study to compare the effects of intermittent RUM and continuous RUM when machining K9 glass. This paper, for the first time, presents an experimental investigation to compare intermittent RUM and continuous RUM when machining K9 glass from the perspectives of cutting force, surface roughness, and chipping size.},

ABSTRACT = {Dual-phase high carbon steel is widely used in mining and in chemical industry applications in highly abrasive environments due to its excellent hardness and abrasion resistance. In recent years, the use of less expensive but more corrosive solutions in industrial processes has become more common. As a result, detailed understanding of the corrosion behaviour of dual-phase high carbon steel is needed; an issue that has, to date, been little-studied. This study investigates in detail the corrosion behaviour of dual-phase high carbon steel in a sodium chloride solution at different times, at the macro- and nano-scale, using various techniques. Using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and 3D laser-scanning confocal microscopy, the corrosion behaviour of this important industrial steel was investigated at the micro-scale, then by using atomic force microscopy (AFM) it was further investigated at the nano-scale. The results reveal preferential corrosion attack on the retained austenitic phase, rather than the martensite phase, which is due to the carbon partitioning between martensite and austenite in this grade of steel.},

ABSTRACT = {The purpose of this paper is to develop a theoretical derivation on aligning discontinuous carbon fiber with an applied electric field, and prove the theory with experiment. A principle with regard to the occurrence of carbon fiber alignment is presented after an introduction of the electromechanical quantities of dielectrics. Based on this principle, an estimation of the polarizability tensor is employed to calculate the required electric field to achieve fiber alignment in liquid solution (e.g., water, resin, etc.). Individual carbon fiber is modeled as a polarizable dielectric cylinder in liquid resin and its motion under direct current (DC) electrical field is decomposed into a polarization effect and rotation effect. A value of 20.12 V/mm is required to align short carbon fibers (0.15 mm) long in liquid resin and is experimentally validated. Finally, an expression to include weight percentage as a means of controlling pearl-chain formation is derived to change the composite’s electrical conductivity.},

ABSTRACT = {The laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) technology was adapted for use with non-spherical low-cost water-atomized iron powders. A simplified numerical and experimental modeling approach was applied to determine—in a first approximation—the operation window for the selected powder in terms of laser power, scanning speed, hatching space, and layer thickness. The operation window, delimited by a build rate ranging from 4 to 25 cm3/h, and a volumetric energy density ranging from 50 to 190 J/mm3, was subsequently optimized to improve the density, the mechanical properties, and the surface roughness of the manufactured specimens. Standard L-PBF-built specimens were subjected to microstructural (porosity, grain size) and metrological (accuracy, shrinkage, minimum wall thickness, surface roughness) analyses and mechanical testing (three-point bending and tensile tests). The results of the microstructural, metrological and mechanical characterizations of the L-PBF-built specimens subjected to stress relieve annealing and hot isostatic pressing were then compared with those obtained with conventional pressing-sintering technology. Finally, by using an energy density of 70 J/mm3 and a build rate of 9 cm3/h, it was possible to manufacture 99.8%-dense specimens with an ultimate strength of 330 MPa and an elongation to failure of 30%, despite the relatively poor circularity of the powder used.},

ABSTRACT = {Titanium aluminide (TiAl) turbine blades produced by isothermal forging have recently been implemented in the low-pressure part of commercial aircraft jet engines. However, the slow speed of isothermal forging, costly molybdenum-based dies and the required protective forging atmosphere makes the process rather expensive. Currently, industrial forging is done by closed-die isothermal forging processes with stationary dies. Idle time occurs when single parts are inserted and extracted from the dies. As an interesting alternative for forging small parts, a new set-up is devised and explored in this work, i.e., batch processing. Using a die set which allow for off-line preassembly and preheating, multiple parts can be forged in one stroke. The design of the batch process was based on a new material model, which was implemented into a finite element system to identify the forging parameters. The setup of the press transport system for batch processing, as well as the results of the simulations and forging experiments are presented. A cost comparison between the new process and conventional forging with stationary dies concludes that for smaller parts such as compressor blades, batch processing offers advantages regarding productivity and cost.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper describes an error separation method for a precision measurement of the run-out of a microdrill bit by using a measurement system consisting of a concentricity gauge and a laser scan micrometer (LSM). The proposed error separation method can achieve a sub-micrometric measurement accuracy of the run-out of the microdrill bit without the requirement of ultra-precision rotary drive devices. In the measurement, the spindle error motion of the concentricity gauge is firstly measured by using the LSM and a small-diameter artifact, instead of the conventionally used displacement probes and large-diameter artifact, in order to determine the fine position of the concentricity gauge when the spindle error motion is at its minimum. The microdrill bit is rotated at the fine position for the measurement of the run-out, so that the influence of the spindle error motion can thus be reduced, which could not be previously realized by commercial measurement systems. Experiments were carried out to verify the feasibility of the proposed error separation method for the measurement of the run-out of the microdrill bit. The measurement results and the measurement uncertainty confirmed that the proposed method is reliable for the run-out measurement with sub-micrometric accuracy.},

ABSTRACT = {Polymer optics are widely used in various applications, replacing traditional glass lenses. The ability to create free-form and micro-structured optics, as well as fast replication, gives them major advantages over traditional glass lenses. However, the fabrication of complex optical components requires full process control and understanding of influencing factors on the quality of the polymer optical parts. In this work, a curved diffractive optical element (DOE) is fabricated using injection compression molding. Different gate designs were evaluated and the movement of the compression stamper was optimized to obtain good filling behavior. The process stability was analyzed and improved by controlling the melt temperature precisely. Finally, the molding parameters were optimized, focusing on the mold temperature, melt temperature and compression force. Curved diffractive optical elements were replicated with feature sizes of 1.6 μm. The experiments showed that all aspects of the molding process have to be controlled perfectly to produce complex polymer optics. High mold temperatures and compression force are necessary to replicate micro-structured features. The work presents a broad investigation and description of the fabrication process and their influences.},

ABSTRACT = {A precise characterization of material behavior is necessary to identify yield criteria or hardening laws for an accurate numerical design of sheet metal forming processes. Current models like Yld2000-2d or Hill’48 do not consider the plane strain state, though this condition is primary cause of failure in deep drawing. It is anticipated that an improved yield locus contour which considers the stress under plane strain conditions leads to better results in numerical simulations of a deep drawing process. Within this contribution, a new experimental setup to characterize both principal stress components under plane strain as additional input data for material modelling is presented. Therefore, hydraulic bulge tests are carried out with a novel elliptical die, which implements a plane strain condition. Moreover, the improvement of the material model is investigated exemplarily for the three sheet metal alloys DC06, DP600 and AA5182. The resulting material parameters are used to identify the yield locus for plane strain by varying the yield locus exponent of Yld2000-2d. The results prove that considering plane strain yield locus results in a better sheet thickness distribution in comparison to conventional modelling of the deep drawing process.},

ABSTRACT = {In this study, a precision motion stage, whose design utilizes a single shaft supported from the bottom by an air bearing and voice coil actuators in complementary double configuration, is evaluated for its dynamic properties, motion accuracy, and potential machining force response, through modal testing, laser interferometric metrology, and spectral analysis, respectively. Modal testing is carried out using two independent methods, which are both based on impact hammer testing. Results are compared with each other and with the predicted natural frequencies based on design calculations. Laser interferometry has been used with varying optics to measure the geometric errors of motion. Laser interferometry results are merged with measured servo errors, estimated thermal errors, and the predicted dynamic response to machining forces, to compile the error budget. Overall accuracy of the stage is calculated as peak-to-valley 5.7 μm with a 2.3 μm non-repeatable part. The accuracy measured is in line with design calculations which incorporated the accuracy grade of the encoder scale and the dimensional tolerances of structural components. The source of the non-repeatable errors remains mostly equivocal, as they fall in the range of random errors of measurement in laser interferometry like alterations of the laser wavelength due to air turbulence.},

ABSTRACT = {One of the most essential components of the fused deposition modeling (FDM) additive manufacturing (AM) process is the build plate, the surface upon which the part is constructed. These are typically made from aluminum or glass, but there are clear disadvantages to both and restrictions on which materials can be processed on them successfully. This study examined the suitability of heated aluminum-polycarbonate (AL-PC) composite print beds for FDM, looking particularly at the mechanical properties, thermal behavior, deformation behavior, bonding strength with deposited material, printing quality, and range of material usability. Theoretical examination and physical experiments were performed for each of these areas; the results were compared to similar experiments done using heated aluminum and aluminum-glass print beds. Ten distinct materials (ABS, PLA, PET, HIPS, PC, TPU, PVA, nylon, metal PLA, and carbon-fiber PLA) were tested for printing performance. The use of a heated AL-PC print bed was found to be a practical option for most of the materials, particularly ABS and TPU, which are often challenging to process using traditional print bed types. Generally, the results were found to be equivalent to or superior to tempered glass and superior to standard aluminum build plates in terms of printing capability.},

ABSTRACT = {Monitoring of the relative deviation between commanded and actual tool tip position, which limits the volumetric performance of the machine tool, enables the use of contemporary methods of compensation to reduce tolerance mismatch and the uncertainties of on-machine measurements. The development of a primarily optical sensor setup capable of being integrated into the machine structure without limiting its operating range is presented. The use of a frequency-modulating interferometer and photosensitive arrays in combination with a Gaussian laser beam allows for fast and automated online measurements of the axes’ motion errors and thermal conditions with comparable accuracy, lower cost, and smaller dimensions as compared to state-of-the-art optical measuring instruments for offline machine tool calibration. The development is tested through simulation of the sensor setup based on raytracing and Monte-Carlo techniques.},

ABSTRACT = {Due to their high ductility, high durability, and excellent corrosion resistance, stainless steels are attractive materials for a variety of applications. However, high work hardening, low thermal conductivity, and high built-up edge (BUE) formation make these materials difficult to machine. Rapid tool wear and high cutting forces are the common problems encountered while machining these materials. In the present work, the application of Taguchi optimization methodology has been used to optimize the cutting parameters of the drilling process for machining two stainless steels: austenitic AISI 304 and duplex AISI 2205 under dry conditions. The machining parameters which were chosen to be evaluated in this study are the tool material, cutting speed, and feed rate, while, the response factors to be measured are the tool life (T), cutting force (Fc), and specific cutting energy (ks). Additionally, empirical models were created for predicting the T, Fc and ks using linear regression analysis. The results of this study show that AISI 2205 stainless steel has a shorter tool life, a higher cutting force, and a higher specific cutting energy than AISI 304 stainless steel. In addition, the Taguchi method determined that A3B1C1 and A3B3C1 (A3 = TiN-coated twist drill, B1 = 13 m/min, B3 = 34 m/min, C1 = 0.12 mm/rev) are the optimized combination of levels for the best tool life and the lowest cutting force, respectively. Meanwhile, the optimized combination of levels for all three control factors from the analysis, which provides the lowest specific cutting energy, was found to be A3B1C3 (A3 = TiN-coated twist drill, B1 = 13 m/min, C3 = 0.32 mm/rev) for both stainless steels.},

ABSTRACT = {The metal 3-D printing market is currently dominated by high-end applications, which make it inaccessible for small and medium enterprises, fab labs, and individual makers who are interested in the ability to prototype and additively manufacture final products in metal. Recent progress led to low-cost open-source metal 3-D printers using a gas metal arc welding (GMAW)-based print head. This reduced the cost of metal 3-D printers into the range of desktop prosumer polymer 3-D printers. Consequent research established good material properties of metal 3-D printed parts with readily-available weld filler wire, reusable substrates, thermal and stress properties, toolpath planning, bead-width control, mechanical properties, and support for overhangs. These previous works showed that GMAW-based metal 3-D printing has a good adhesion between layers and is not porous inside the printed parts, but they did not proceed far enough to demonstrate applications. In this study, the utility of the GMAW approach to 3-D printing is investigated using a low-cost open-source metal 3-D printer and a converted Computer Numerical Control router machine to make useful parts over a range of applications including: fixing an existing part by adding a 3-D metal feature, creating a product using the substrate as part of the component, 3-D printing in high resolution of useful objects, near net objects, and making an integrated product using a combination of steel and polymer 3-D printing. The results show that GMAW-based 3-D printing is capable of distributed manufacturing of useful products for a wide variety of applications for sustainable development.},

ABSTRACT = {An S-shaped machining test is proposed for the ISO 10791-7 standard to verify the performance of five-axis machining centers. However, investigation of the factor that has the most influence on the geometrical accuracy of finished S-shaped workpieces has not been undertaken. Determination of the influence of NC program tolerance and geometric errors concerning the rotary axes on the accuracy of the finished S-shaped workpiece forms the main objective of the study. Actual cutting experiments as well as simulations were performed during the proposed investigation. Our results clarify that NC-program tolerance has a significant influence on the end quality of the machined surface. Although geometric errors pertaining to rotary axes also have a significant influence on machined-surface quality, it is difficult to evaluate the influence of each individual error, because all geometric errors make glitches at the same point on the machined surface. The proposed S-shaped machining test can be used to provide a complete demonstration of available machining techniques.},

ABSTRACT = {Due to the constant need for better functionalized surfaces or smaller, function integrated components, precise and efficient manufacturing processes have to be established. Micro milling with micro end mills is one of the most promising processes for this task as it combines a high geometric flexibility in a wide range of machinable materials with low set-up costs. A downside of this process is the wear of the micro end mills. Due to size effects and the relatively low cutting speed, the cutting edge is especially subjected to massive abrasive wear. One possibility to minimize this wear is coating of micro end mills. This research paper describes the performance of eight different hard coatings for micro end mills with a diameter <40 µm and discusses some properties for the best performing coating type. With this research, it is therefore possible to boost the possibilities of micro milling for the manufacture of next generation products.},

ABSTRACT = {To be competitive in a manufacturing environment by providing optimal performance in terms of cost-effectiveness and swiftness of system changes, there is a need for flexible production systems based on a well-defined strategy. Companies are steadily looking for methodology to evaluate, improve and update the performance of manufacturing systems for processing operations. Implementation of an adequate strategy for these systems’ flexibility requires a deep understanding of the intricate interactions between the machining process parameters and the manufacturing system’s operational parameters. This paper proposes a framework/generic model for one of the most common metal cutting operations—the boring process of an engine block machining system. A system dynamics modelling approach is presented for modelling the structure of machining system parameters of the boring process, key performance parameters and their intrinsic relationships. The model is based on a case study performed in a company manufacturing engine blocks for heavy vehicles. The approach could allow for performance evaluation of an engine block manufacturing system condition. The presented model enables a basis for other similar processes and industries producing discrete parts.},

ABSTRACT = {Additive manufacturing (AM) of soft materials has a wide variety of applications, such as customized or wearable devices. Silicone is one popular material for these applications given its favorable material properties. However, AM of silicone parts with overhang structures remains challenging due to the soft nature of the material. Overhang structures are the areas where there is no underlying structure. Typically, a support material is used and built in the underlying space so that the overhang structures can be built upon it. Currently, there is no support structure that has been used for AM of silicone. The goal of this study is to develop an AM process to fabricate silicone parts with overhang structures. We first identified and confirmed poly-vinyl alcohol (PVA), a water-soluble material, as a suitable support material for silicone by evaluating the adhesion strength between silicone and PVA. Process parameters for the support material, including critical overhang angle and minimum infill density for the support material, are identified. However, overhang angle alone is not the only determining factor for support material. As silicone is a soft material, it deflects due to its own weight when the height of the overhang structure increases. A finite element model is developed to estimate the critical overhang height paired with different overhang angles to determine whether the use of support material is needed. Finally, parts with overhang structures are printed to demonstrate the capability of the developed process.},

ABSTRACT = {The fabrication of engineered lattice structures has recently gained momentum due to the development of novel additive manufacturing techniques. Interest in lattice structures resides not only in the possibility of obtaining efficient lightweight materials, but also in the functionality of pre-designed architectured structures for specific applications, such as biomimetic implants, chemical catalyzers, and heat transfer devices. The mechanical behaviour of lattice structures depends not only the composition of the base material, but also on the type and size of the unit cells, as well as on the material microstructure resulting from a specific fabrication procedure. The present work focuses on the static and fatigue behavior of diamond cell lattice structures fabricated from an AlSiMg alloy by laser powder bed fusion technology. In particular, the specimens were fabricated with three different orientations of lattice cells—[001], [011], [111]—and subjected to static tensile testing and force-controlled pull–pull fatigue testing up to 1 × 107 cycles. In parallel, the mechanical behavior of dense tensile plain and notched specimens was also studied and compared to that of their lattice counterparts. Results showed a significant effect of the cell orientation on the fatigue lives: specimens oriented at [001] were ~30% more fatigue-resistant than specimens oriented at [011] and [111].},

ABSTRACT = {In this work, the microstructure, texture, phases, and microhardness of 45° printed (with respect to the build direction) homogenized, and hot isostatically pressed (HIP) cylindrical IN718 specimens are investigated. Phase morphology, grain size, microhardness, and crystallographic texture at the bottom of each specimen differ from those of the top due to changes in cooling rate. High cooling rates during the printing process generated a columnar grain structure parallel to the building direction in the as-printed condition with a texture transition from (001) orientation at the bottom of the specimen to (111) orientation towards the specimen top based on EBSD analysis. A mixed columnar and equiaxed grain structure associated with about a 15% reduction in texture is achieved after homogenization treatment. HIP treatment caused significant grain coarsening, and engendered equiaxed grains with an average diameter of 154.8 µm. These treatments promoted the growth of δ-phase (Ni3Nb) and MC-type brittle (Ti, Nb)C carbides at grain boundaries. Laves phase (Fe2Nb) was also observed in the as-printed and homogenized specimens. Ostwald ripening of (Ti, Nb)C carbides caused excessive grain growth at the bottom of the HIPed IN718 specimens, while smaller grains were observed at their top. Microhardness in the as-fabricated specimens was 236.9 HV and increased in the homogenized specimens by 19.3% to 282.6 HV due to more even distribution of secondary precipitates, and the nucleation of smaller grains. A 36.1% reduction in microhardness to 180.5 HV was found in the HIPed condition due to   γ ″ phase dissolution and differences in grain morphology.},

ABSTRACT = {This experimental study focuses on various cooling strategies and lubrication-assisted cooling strategies to improve machining performance in the turning process of AISI 4140 steel. Liquid nitrogen (LN2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) were used as cryogenic coolants, and their performances were compared with respect to progression of tool wear. Minimum quantity lubrication (MQL) was also used with carbon dioxide. Progression of wear, including flank and nose, are the main outputs examined during experimental study. This study illustrates that carbon dioxide-assisted cryogenic machining alone and with minimum quantity lubrication does not contribute to decreasing the progression of wear within selected cutting conditions. This study also showed that carbon dioxide-assisted cryogenic machining helps to increase chip breakability. Liquid nitrogen-assisted cryogenic machining results in a reduction of tool wear, including flank and nose wear, in the machining process of AISI 4140 steel material. It was also observed that in the machining process of this material at a cutting speed of 80 m/min, built-up edges occurred in both cryogenic cooling conditions. Additionally, chip flow damage occurs in particularly dry machining.},

ABSTRACT = {Among additive manufacturing (AM) techniques, Selective Laser Melting (SLM) is widely used to fabricate metal components, including biocompatible bone implants made of 316L stainless steel. However, an issue with the components manufactured using this technique is the surface quality, which is generally beyond the acceptable range. Thus, hybrid manufacturing, including AM and finish machining processes, are being developed and implemented in the industry. Machining processes, particularly finish machining, are needed to improve surface quality of additively manufactured components and performance. This study focuses on the finish machining process of additively manufactured 316L stainless steel parts. Finish machining tests were carried out under dry conditions for various cutting speeds and feed rates. The experimental study reveals that finish machining resulted in up to 88% lower surface roughness of SLMed 316L stainless steel; it also had a substantial effect on microstructure and microhardness of the additively manufactured components by creating smaller grains and strain-hardened layer on the surface and subsurface of the SLMed part. The finish machining process also significantly decreased the density of porosity on the surface and subsurface, compared to an as-built sample. The created strain harden layer with less porosity is expected to increases wear and fatigue resistance of these parts.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper presents an original method of predicting temperature distribution in orthogonal machining based on a constitutive model of various materials and the mechanics of their cutting process. Currently, temperature distribution is commonly investigated using arduous experiments, computationally inefficient numerical analyses, and complex analytical models. In the method proposed herein, the average temperatures at the primary shear zone (PSZ) and the secondary shear zone (SSZ) were determined for various materials, based on a constitutive model and a chip-formation model using measurements of cutting force and chip thickness. The temperatures were determined when differences between predicted shear stresses using the Johnson–Cook constitutive model (J–C model) and those using a chip-formation model were minimal. J–C model constants from split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) tests were adopted from the literature. Cutting conditions, experimental cutting force, and chip thickness were used to predict the shear stresses. The temperature predictions were compared to documented results in the literature for AISI 1045 steel and Al 6082-T6 aluminum in multiple tests in an effort to validate this methodology. Good agreement was observed for the tests with each material. Thanks to the reliable and easily measurable cutting forces and chip thicknesses, and the simple forms of the employed models, the presented methodology has less experimental complexity, less mathematical complexity, and high computational efficiency.},

ABSTRACT = {The additive manufacturing (AM) of aluminum alloys promises to considerably enhance the performance of lightweight critical parts in various industrial applications. AlSi10Mg is one of the compatible Al alloys used in the selective laser melting of lightweight components. However, the surface defects obtained from the as-built parts affect their mechanical properties, and thus represent an obstacle to using them as final products. This study aims to improve the surface characteristics of the as-built AlSi10Mg parts using shot peening (SP). To achieve this goal, different SP intensities were applied to various surface textures of the as-built samples. The SP results showed a significant improvement in the as-built surface topography and a higher value of effective depth using 22.9 A intensity and Gp165 glass beads. The area near the shot-peened surface showed a significant microstructure refinement to a specific depth due to the dynamic precipitation of nanoscale Si particles. Surface hardening was also detected and high compressive residual stresses were generated due to severe plastic deformation. The surface characteristics obtained after SP could result in a significant improvement in the mechanical properties and fatigue strength, and thus promise performance enhancement for critical parts in various industrial applications.},

ABSTRACT = {In order to improve the finishing efficiency of traditional plane magnetic abrasive finishing (MAF), we have previously proposed an effective plane MAF process combined with an electrolytic process and developed a special compound machining tool for the electrolytic magnetic abrasive finishing (EMAF). In this research, the EMAF process is divided into two finishing steps. The first finishing step is the EMAF step, and a single MAF step constitutes the second finishing step. The machinability of SUS304 material can be improved through the formation of passive films from the electrolytic process in the EMAF step. Meanwhile, the passive films can be rapidly and easily removed by friction between the magnetic particles and the workpiece-generated mechanical machining force. Thus, the surface finishing efficiency can be greatly improved. Compared with a dedicated MAF machining tool or a dedicated electrolytic machining tool, this special compound machining tool can synchronously achieve MAF and electrolytic processes to make the processing more convenient. This study focuses on exploring mechanical finishing characteristics of the special compound machining tool through MAF experiments. Additionally, EMAF experiments are conducted under the optimal mechanical finishing conditions. The experimental results of the EMAF process show that the surface roughness Ra can be reduced to less than 30 nm at the 4-min EMAF step, and it can be further reduced to 20 nm at the 10-min MAF step.},

ABSTRACT = {Difficult-to-cut materials have been widely employed in many engineering applications, including automotive and aeronautical designs because of their effective properties. However, other characteristics; for example, high hardness and low thermal conductivity has negatively affected the induced surface quality and tool life, and consequently the overall machinability of such materials. Inconel 718, is widely used in many industries including aerospace; however, the high temperature generated during machining is negatively affecting its machinability. Flood cooling is a commonly used remedy to improve machinability problems; however, government regulation has called for further alternatives to reduce the environmental and health impacts of flood cooling. This work aimed to investigate the influence of dispersed multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and aluminum oxide (Al2O3) gamma nanoparticles, on enhancing the minimum quantity lubrication (MQL) technique cooling and lubrication capabilities during turning of Inconel 718. Machining tests were conducted, the generated surfaces were examined, and the energy consumption data were recorded. The study was conducted under different design variables including cutting speed, percentage of added nano-additives (wt.%), and feed velocity. The study revealed that the nano-fluids usage, generally improved the machining performance when cutting Inconel 718. In addition, it was shown that the nanotubes additives provided better improvements than Al2O3 nanoparticles.},

ABSTRACT = {Laser Cladding is one of the leading processes within Additive Manufacturing technologies, which has concentrated a considerable amount of effort on its development. In regard to the latter, the current study aims to summarize the influence of the most relevant process parameters in the laser cladding processing of single and compound volumes (solid forms) made from AISI 316L stainless steel powders and using a coaxial nozzle for their deposition. Process speed, applied laser power and powder flow are considered to be the main variables affecting the laser cladding in single clads, whereas overlap percentage and overlapping strategy also become relevant when dealing with multiple clads. By setting appropriate values for each process parameter, the main goal of this paper is to develop a processing window in which a good metallurgical bond between the delivered powder and the substrate is obtained, trying simultaneously to maintain processing times at their lowest value possible. Conventional metallography techniques were performed on the cross sections of the laser tracks to measure the effective dimensions of clads, height and width, as well as the resulting dilution value. Besides the influence of the overlap between contiguous clads and layers, physical defects such as porosity and cracks were also evaluated. Optimum process parameters to maximize productivity were defined as 13 mm/s, 2500 W, 30% of overlap and a 25 g/min powder feed rate.},

ABSTRACT = {Laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) is one of the most potent additive manufacturing (AM) processes. Metallic LPBF is gaining popularity, but one of the obstacles facing its larger industrial use is the limited knowledge of its dimensional and geometrical performances. This paper presents a metrological investigation of the geometrical and dimensional deviations of a selected LPBF-manufactured component, according to the ASME Y14.5-2009 standard. This approach allows for an estimation of both the process capability, as per ISO 22514-4 standard, and the correlations between the part location in the manufacturing chamber and the profile deviations. Forty-nine parts, which are representative of a typical aerospace tooling component (30 mm in diameter and 27.2 mm in height) were manufactured from AlSi10Mg powder using an EOSINT M280 printer and subjected to a stress relief annealing at 300 °C for two hours. This manufacturing procedure was repeated three times. A complete statistical analysis was carried out and the results of the investigation show that LPBF performances for all geometrical variations of 147 identical parts fall within a range of 230 µm at a 99.73% level.},

ABSTRACT = {The ability to produce consistent material properties across a single or series of platforms, particularly over time, is the major objective in metal additive manufacturing (MAM) research. If this can be achieved, it will result in widespread adoption of the technology for industry and place it into mainstream manufacturing. However, before this can happen, it is critical to develop an understanding of how processing parameters influence the thermal conditions which dictate the mechanical properties of MAM builds. Research work reported in the literature of MAM is generally based on a set of parameters and/or the review of a few parameter changes, and observing the effects that these changes (i.e., microstructure, mechanical properties) have. While these articles provide results with some insight, there lacks a standard approach that can be used to allow meaningful comparisons and conclusions to be made concerning the optimization of the processing variables. This study provides a template which can be used for making comparisons across DED platforms. The tests are performed with a design of experiments (DOE) philosophy directed to evaluate the effect of selected parameters on the measured properties of the DED builds. Specifically, a laser engineering net shaping system (LENS) is used to build multilayered 316L coupons and analyze how build parameters such as laser power, travel speed, and powder feed rate influence the thermal conditions that will define both microstructure and microhardness. A fundamental conclusion of this research is that it is possible to repeatedly obtain a consistent microstructure that contains a fine cellular substructure with a low level of porosity (less than 1.1%) and with microhardness that is equal to or better than wrought 316L. This is mainly achieved by maintaining an associated powder flow to travel speed ratio at the power level, ensuring an appropriate net heat input for the build process.},

ABSTRACT = {A physics-based analytical model is proposed in order to predict the temperature profile during metal additive manufacturing (AM) processes, by considering the effects of temperature history in each layer, temperature-sensitivity of material properties and latent heat. The moving heat source analysis is used in order to predict the temperature distribution inside a semi-infinite solid material. The laser thermal energy deposited into a control volume is absorbed by the material thermodynamic latent heat and conducted through the contacting solid boundaries. The analytical model takes in to account the typical multi-layer aspect of additive manufacturing processes for the first time. The modeling of the problem involving multiple layers is of great importance because the thermal interactions of successive layers affect the temperature gradients, which govern the heat transfer and thermal stress development mechanisms. The temperature profile is calculated for isotropic and homogeneous material. The proposed model can be used to predict the temperature in laser-based metal additive manufacturing configurations of either direct metal deposition or selective laser melting. A numerical analysis is also conducted to simulate the temperature profile in metal AM. These two models are compared with experimental results. The proposed model also well captured the melt pool geometry as it is compared to experimental values. In order to emphasize the importance of solving the problem considering multiple layers, the peak temperature considering the layer addition and peak temperature not considering the layer addition are compared. The results show that considering the layer addition aspect of metal additive manufacturing can help to better predict the surface temperature and melt pool geometry. An analysis is conducted to show the importance of considering the temperature sensitivity of material properties in predicting temperature. A comparison of the computational time is also provided for analytical and numerical modeling. Based on the obtained results, it appears that the proposed analytical method provides an effective and accurate method to predict the temperature in metal AM.},

ABSTRACT = {One of the challenges of additive manufacturing (AM) technology is the inability to generate repeatable microstructure and mechanical properties in different orientations. In this work, the effect of build orientation on the microstructure and mechanical properties of Ti–6Al–4V specimens manufactured by selective laser melting (SLM) was studied. The samples built in the Z orientation showed weaker tensile strength compared to the samples built in X, and Y orientations. Samples built in X and Y orientations exhibited brittle fracture features in areas close to the substrate and ductile fracture features in the area farther from the substrate. Defects including pores, cracks, and unmelted/partially-melted powder particles contributed to lower tensile and fracture toughness properties in different orientations.},

ABSTRACT = {The new generation of ICT solutions applied to the monitoring, adaptation, simulation and optimisation of factories are key enabling technologies for a new level of manufacturing capability and adaptability in the context of Industry 4.0. Given the advances in sensor technologies, factories, as well as machine tools can now be sensorised, and the vast amount of data generated can be exploited by intelligent information processing techniques such as machine learning. This paper presents an online tool wear classification system built in terms of a monitoring infrastructure, dedicated to perform dry milling on steel while capturing force signals, and a computing architecture, assembled for the assessment of the flank wear based on deep learning. In particular, this approach demonstrates that a big data analytics method for classification applied to large volumes of continuously-acquired force signals generated at high speed during milling responds sufficiently well when used as an indicator of the different stages of tool wear. This research presents the design, development and deployment of the system components and an overall evaluation that involves machining experiments, data collection, training and validation, which, as a whole, has shown an accuracy of 78%.},

ABSTRACT = {Remanufacturing is a viable option to extend the useful life of an end-of-use product or its parts, ensuring sustainable competitive advantages under the current global economic climate. Challenges typical to remanufacturing still persist, despite its many benefits. According to the European Remanufacturing Network, a key challenge is the lack of accurate, timely and consistent product knowledge as highlighted in a 2015 survey of 188 European remanufacturers. With more data being produced by electric and hybrid vehicles, this adds to the information complexity challenge already experienced in remanufacturing. Therefore, it is difficult to implement real-time and accurate remanufacturing for the shop floor; there are no papers that focus on this within an electric and hybrid vehicle environment. To address this problem, this paper attempts to: (1) identify the required parameters/variables needed for fuel cell remanufacturing by means of interviews; (2) rank the variables by Pareto analysis; (3) develop a casual loop diagram for the identified parameters/variables to visualise their impact on remanufacturing; and (4) model a simple stock and flow diagram to simulate and understand data and information-driven schemes in remanufacturing.},

ABSTRACT = {Keyhole laser welding experiments with 1.5 mm thick aluminum sheets (EN AW-6082) were carried out with transversal beam oscillation and wire feeding. A circular cavity, which was named buttonhole, formed directly behind the laser spot at certain oscillation frequencies. The welding states “no buttonhole”, “unstable buttonhole”, and “stable buttonhole” were distinguished. The melt pool dynamics were experimentally analyzed and correlated with the resulting roughness and waviness of the seam surfaces. Criteria for stable buttonhole welding were derived. On the basis of the cavity radii relations, it is shown that capillary pressure conditions can explain the movement of the buttonhole with the process.},

ABSTRACT = {In this fundamental work, a series of experiments were performed to define the optimal amount of dispersant and solid content for feedstock with and without ceramic fibers (Nextel 610). Based on these fixed conditions, investigations were carried out to discover the effects of binder system, fiber sizing, and increasing fiber content on mixing and viscosity. In addition, the effects of kneading temperature and time, fiber sizing, and different binder systems on fiber length were investigated using a measuring mixer, high-pressure capillary rheometer, and microscopy. Stearic acid, as a dispersant, modified the particle surface and improved the rheological properties. Moreover, increasing the solid content in the feedstocks led to an exponential growth of final torque and relative viscosity, because of the increasing friction between particles. Paraffin wax (PW)- and polyethylene glycol (PEG)-based feedstocks showed different mixing behaviors and rheological results with increasing fiber, whereas PEG-based feedstocks had higher final torques and kneading energies without fibers, whilst PEG feedstocks displayed lower viscosities. Consequently, during kneading, the amount of fiber has been predominating over fiber length, and the effect of the binder, the kneading temperature, and time did not cause significant changes.},

ABSTRACT = {This study shows the effect of hot isostatic pressing (HIP) on the porosity and the microstructure, as well as the corresponding fatigue strength of selectively-laser-melted (SLM) AlSi10Mg structures. To eliminate the influence of the as-built surface, all specimens are machined and exhibit a polished surface. To highlight the effect of the HIP treatment, the HIP specimens are compared to a test series without any post-treatment. The fatigue characteristic is evaluated by tension-compression high cycle fatigue tests under a load stress ratio of R = −1. The influence of HIP on the microstructural characteristics is investigated by utilizing scanning electron microscopy of micrographs of selected samples. In order to study the failure mechanism and the fatigue crack origin, a fracture surface analysis is carried out. It is found that, due to the HIP process and subsequent annealing, there is a beneficial effect on the microstructure regarding the fatigue crack propagation, such as Fe-rich precipitates and silicon agglomerations. This leads, combined with a significant reduction of global porosity and a decrease of micro pore sizes, to an improved fatigue resistance for the HIPed condition compared to the other test series within this study.},

ABSTRACT = {Beam oscillation in laser material processing makes it possible to influence process behavior in terms of energy distribution, stability, melt pool dynamics and solidification. Within the setup presented here, the beam is oscillated transverse to the welding direction, and the filler wire is fed to the melt pool of a butt joint with an air gap. One advantage of this setup is the large gap bridging ability. Certain parameter sets lead to the so-called buttonhole welding method, which allows laser welding of smooth and nearly ripple-free seams. Observations showed a transition area between conventional keyhole and buttonhole welding in which the process is destabilized. Welds made with parameter sets from this area contain critical seam defects. Welding experiments with high-speed video recording and a simplified analytical model about the wire-beam interaction have helped to elucidate the mechanisms behind this. EN AW-6082 sheet material in 1.5 mm thickness and ML 4043 filler wire with 1.2 mm diameter were used. The investigations lead to the conclusion that partially melted wire segments result at certain parameter relations which hinder the formation of a buttonhole. If these segments are prevented, buttonhole welding occurs. In the transition area, these segments are very small and can lead to the detachment of a buttonhole, resulting in the named seam defects.},

ABSTRACT = {An ever-growing market demand for board (second) level packages (e.g., embedded systems, system-on-a-chip, etc.) poses newer challenges for its manufacturing industry in terms of competitive pricing, higher reliability, and overall dimensions. Such packages are encapsulated for various reasons including thermal management, protection from environmental conditions and dust particles, and enhancing the mechanical stability. In the due course of reducing overall sizes and material saving, an encapsulation as thin as possible imposes its own significance. Such a thin-walled conformal encapsulation serves as an added advantage by reducing the thermo-mechanical stresses occurring due to thermal-cyclic loading, compared to block-sized or thicker encapsulations. This paper assesses the encapsulation process of a board-level package by means of thermoset injection molding. Various aspects reviewed in this paper include the conception of a demonstrator, investigation of the flow simulation of the injection molding process, execution of molding trials with different encapsulation thicknesses, and characterization of the packages. The process shows a high dependence on the substrate properties, injection molding process parameters, device mounting tolerances, and device geometry tolerances. Nevertheless, the thermoset injection molding process is suitable for the encapsulation of board-level packages limiting itself only with respect to the thickness of the encapsulation material, which depends on other external aforementioned factors.},

ABSTRACT = {In the spirit of flexible manufacturing, the novel forming process “flexible roller beading” was developed, which allows the incremental production of height-variable sheet metal profiles. After designing the process and realizing a test facility for flexible roller beading, the feasibility was experimentally shown. The following step addresses the expansion of the process limits. With this aim, the mechanical behavior of the sheet metal during the process was investigated by means of FEA. Due to the variable cross-section development of the sheet metal profile, a multidimensional stress distribution was identified. Based on the present state of stress and strain, conclusions about the origin of appearing defect formations were drawn. Observed defects were sheet wrinkles as a result of compressive stresses in the profile flange and material thinning in the profile legs and bottom due to unintendedly exceeding tensile stresses. The influences of the forming strategy as well as tool- and workpiece-side variations on the quality of the manufacturing result were investigated. From the results of the analyses, measures to avoid component failure were derived. Given all the findings, guidelines were concluded that are to be considered in designing the forming sequence. With the insights into the occurring processes and the mastery of this novel forming process, important contributions are made to its industrial suitability. The approach of lightweight and load-oriented component design can be extended by realizing new families of sheet metal profiles. With respect to Industry 4.0, on-demand manufacturing is increasingly required, which is why flexible roller beading is of substantial relevance for the industrial sheet metal production.},

ABSTRACT = {A simplified analytical model of the laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) process was used to develop a novel density prediction approach that can be adapted for any given powder feedstock and LPBF system. First, calibration coupons were built using IN625, Ti64 and Fe powders and a specific LPBF system. These coupons were manufactured using the predetermined ranges of laser power, scanning speed, hatching space, and layer thickness, and their densities were measured using conventional material characterization techniques. Next, a simplified melt pool model was used to calculate the melt pool dimensions for the selected sets of printing parameters. Both sets of data were then combined to predict the density of printed parts. This approach was additionally validated using the literature data on AlSi10Mg and 316L alloys, thus demonstrating that it can reliably be used to optimize the laser powder bed metal fusion process.},

ABSTRACT = {Carbon fiber-reinforced polymers (CFRP) are widely used in the aerospace industry. A new generation of aircraft is being built using CFRP for up to 50% of their total weight, to achieve higher performance. Exit delamination and surface integrity are significant challenges reported during conventional drilling. Exit delamination influences the mechanical properties of machined parts and, consequently, reduces fatigue life. Vibration-assisted drilling (VAD) has much potential to overcome these challenges. This study is aimed at investigating exit delamination and geometrical accuracy during VAD at both low- and high-frequency ranges. The kinematics of VAD are used to investigate the relationship between the input parameters (cutting speed, feed, vibration frequency, and amplitude) and the uncut chip thickness. Exit delamination and geometrical accuracy are then evaluated in terms of mechanical and thermal load. The results show a 31% reduction in cutting temperature, as well as a significant enhancement in exit delamination, by using the VAD technology.},

ABSTRACT = {With the dramatic increment of complexity, more microfluidic devices require 3D structures, such as multi-depth and -layer channels. The traditional multi-step photolithography is time-consuming and labor-intensive and also requires precise alignment during the fabrication of microfluidic devices. Here, we present an inexpensive, single-step, and rapid fabrication method for multi-depth microfluidic devices using a high-resolution liquid crystal display (LCD) stereolithographic (SLA) three-dimensional (3D) printing system. With the pixel size down to 47.25 μm, the feature resolutions in the horizontal and vertical directions are 150 μm and 50 μm, respectively. The multi-depth molds were successfully printed at the same time and the multi-depth features were transferred properly to the polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) having multi-depth channels via soft lithography. A flow-focusing droplet generator with a multi-depth channel was fabricated using the presented 3D printing method. Experimental results show that the multi-depth channel could manipulate the morphology and size of droplets, which is desired for many engineering applications. Taken together, LCD SLA 3D printing is an excellent alternative method to the multi-step photolithography for the fabrication of multi-depth microfluidic devices. Taking the advantages of its controllability, cost-effectiveness, and acceptable resolution, LCD SLA 3D printing can have a great potential to fabricate 3D microfluidic devices.},

ABSTRACT = {The purpose of the study was to propose a strategy to assess the potential reduction of the production cost during wire+arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) based on the combination of wire feed speed (related to deposition rate) and travel speed (related to deposition time). A series of experiments, using a multilayer-non-oscillated single pass wall made of an Al-Mg alloy, was conducted. The quality of the wall was assessed through the lateral surface waviness and top layer undulation. The concepts of Surface Waviness and Buy-to-Apply indices were introduced. Initially, the range of travel speed (TS) that provided layers with acceptable quality was determined for a given wire feed speed (WFS), corresponding to a constant current. Then, the effect of the increase of production capacity of the process (though current raising, yet maintaining the ratio WFS/TS constant) on the wall quality for a given condition within the TS range was assessed. The results showed that the useful range of TS prevents too rough a waving surface below the lower limit and top surface undulation over the higher limit. However, inside the range, there is little quality variation for the case under study. Finally, simulations of deposition time were developed to demonstrate the weight of the TS on the final deposition time and wall quality as a function of a target wall width. This respective weight showed the existence of a complex and unpredictable, yet determined, power of a combination of TS, target wall geometry, and dead time between subsequent layers. It was verified to be possible to find optimized TS as a function of different target geometries.},

ABSTRACT = {This work presents an innovative system that allows the oriented deposition of continuous fibers or long fibers, pre-impregnated or not, in a thermoplastic matrix. This system is used in an integrated way with the filamentary fusion additive manufacturing technology and allows a localized and oriented reinforcement of polymer components for advanced engineering applications at a low cost. To demonstrate the capabilities of the developed system, composite components of thermoplastic matrix (polyamide) reinforced with pre-impregnated long carbon fiber (carbon + polyamide), 1 K and 3 K, were processed and their tensile and flexural strength evaluated. It was demonstrated that the tensile strength value depends on the density of carbon fibers present in the composite, and that with the passage of 2 to 4 layers of fibers, an increase in breaking strength was obtained of about 366% and 325% for the 3 K and 1 K yarns, respectively. The increase of the fiber yarn diameter leads to higher values of tensile strength of the composite. The obtained standard deviation reveals that the deposition process gives rise to components with anisotropic mechanical properties and the need to optimize the processing parameters, especially those that lead to an increase in adhesion between deposited layers.},

ABSTRACT = {Machining processes, including turning, are a critical capability for discrete part production. One limitation to high material removal rates and reduced cost in these processes is chatter, or unstable spindle speed-chip width combinations that exhibit a self-excited vibration. In this paper, an artificial neural network (ANN)—a data learning model—is applied to model turning stability. The novel approach is to use a physics-based process model—the analytical stability limit—to generate a (synthetic) data set that trains the ANN. This enables the process physics to be combined with data learning in a hybrid approach. As anticipated, it is observed that the number and distribution of training points influences the ability of the ANN model to capture the smaller, more closely spaced lobes that occur at lower spindle speeds. Overall, the ANN is successful (>90% accuracy) at predicting the stability behavior after appropriate training.},

ABSTRACT = {Producing metallic bipolar plates for Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) fuel cells by forming is still a topic of research. So far, it has mainly been applied for small batches, but it offers substantial advantages regarding both costs and installation space compared to the established graphite based solutions. One new possibility for an efficient manufacturing process of these metallic bipolar plates is the forming by rolling. For the first time, this technology was used for relevant industrial scale channel geometries. By the use of an experimental rolling mill, 0.1 mm thick 316L (1.4404) stainless steel foils were roll-formed to achieve previously designed channel geometries within one rolling pass. The conducted experiments show promising results regarding the forming accuracy and the shape of the channel cross-sections. With the aim for a proof of concept in the beginning and a subsequent optimization of the process, a numerical simulation was set up prior to the real experiments and later calibrated with the experimental forming results. This calibrated model was used for further improvements of the process with the objective at reducing wrinkles and distortion. The investigation of this new process method for the manufacturing of metallic bipolar plates shows enormous potential and can lead to a more efficient and cheaper production.},

To ensure process quality and reliability, the influence of all process parameters and conditions needs to be understood. The product quality and reliability characteristics, i.e., dimensional accuracy, precision, repeatability, and reproducibility are mostly affected by inherent and systematic manufacturing process variations. This paper presents research on dimensional quality and distortion analysis of AlSi10Mg thin-walled parts developed by a selective laser melting technique. The input process parameters were fixed, and the impact of inherent process variation on dimensional accuracy and precision was studied. The process stability and variability were examined under repeatability and reproducibility conditions. The sample length (horizontal dimension) results revealed a 0.05 mm maximum dimensional error, 0.0197 mm repeatability, and 0.0169 mm reproducibility. Similarly, in sample height (vertical dimension) results, 0.258 mm maximum dimensional error, 0.0237 mm repeatability, and 0.0863 mm reproducibility were observed. The effect of varying design thickness on thickness accuracy was analyzed, and regression analysis performed. The maximum 0.038 mm error and 0.018 mm standard deviation was observed for the 1 mm thickness sample, which significantly decreased for sample thickness ≥2 mm. The % error decreased exponentially with increasing sample thickness. The distortion analysis was performed to explore the effect of sample thickness on part distortion. The 0.5 mm thickness sample shows a very high distortion comparatively, and it is reduced significantly for >0.5 mm thickness samples. The study is further extended to examine the effect of solution heat treatment and artificial aging on the accuracy, precision, and distortion; however, it did not improve the results. Conclusively, the sample dimensions, i.e., length and height, have shown fluctuations due to inherent process characteristics under repeatability and reproducibility conditions. The ANOVA results revealed that sample length means are not statistically significantly different, whereas sample height means are significantly different. The horizontal dimensions in the xy-plane have better accuracy and precision compared to the vertical dimension in the z-axis. The accuracy and precision increased, whereas part distortion decreased with increasing thickness.},

ABSTRACT = {Root pass manufacturing in automated welding is still a challenge when the backing plate is not feasible. Using the concept of bead formation in an original way, the GMAW (Gas Metal Arc Welding) switchback technique was assessed against linear movement as a means of facing this challenge. Experimental work was applied, keeping the process parametrization and joint configuration, so that only the switchback parameters were modified, i.e., the stroke lengths and speeds. Thermography was used to estimate the effect of the switchback parameters on bead formation. The results showed the potential of the switchback technique as a means of favoring weld pool control. Surprisingly, the operational gap range is not necessarily larger when switchback is applied. The strong influence of stroke lengths and speeds on the process performance was characterized. In general, the results showed that linear movement leads to larger pools and deeper penetrations, more adequate for gaps with no clearances. Shorter stroke lengths and slower stroke speeds (intermediate pool size) better suit root gaps that are not too wide, while longer stroke lengths and faster stroke speeds (smaller pool size, more easily sustainable) are applicable to larger root gaps.},

ABSTRACT = {The use of lightweight material such as CFRP/Ti6Al4V in stacked structures in the aerospace industry is associated with improved physical and mechanical characteristics. The drilling process of nonuniform structures plays a significant role prior to the assembly operation. However, this drilling process is typically associated with unacceptable CFRP delamination, hole accuracy, and high tool wear. These machining difficulties are attributed to high thermal load and poor chip evacuation mechanism. Low-frequency vibration-assisted drilling (LF-VAD) is an advanced manufacturing technique where the dynamic change of the uncut chip thickness is used to manipulate the cutting energy. An efficient chip evacuation mechanism was achieved through axial tool oscillation. This study investigates the effect of vibration-assisted drilling machining parameters on tool wear mechanisms. The paper also presents the effect of tool wear progression on drilled hole quality. Hole quality is described by CFRP entry and exit delamination and hole accuracy. The results showed a significant reduction in the thrust force, cutting torque, cutting temperature, and flank wear-land.},

ABSTRACT = {The potential of Additive Manufacturing (AM) is high, with a whole new set of manufactured parts with unseen complexity being offered. However, the process has limitations, and for the sake of economic competitiveness, these should also be considered. Therefore, a computational methodology, capable of including the referenced limitations and providing initial solid designs for Selective Laser Melting (SLM) is the subject of the present work. The combination of Topology Optimization (TO) with the simplified fabrication model is the selected methodology. Its formulation, implementation, and integration on the classic TO algorithm is briefly discussed, being capable of addressing the minimum feature size and the overhang constraint limitations. Moreover, the performance and numerical stability of the methodology is evaluated, and numerical variables, such as the accuracy of structural equilibrium equations and the material interpolation model, are considered. A comparative study between these variables is presented. The paper then proposes an enhanced version of the selected methodology, with a better convergence towards a discrete solution.},

ABSTRACT = {In injection molding, the reduction of ejection forces is a process relevant aspect to improve the production rates. For this purpose, CrN and CrAlN films were sputtered on cylindrical and quadratic AISI H11 cores of an injection mold in order to investigate their influence on the resulting ejection forces to demold polypropylene test components. Within this context, the ejection forces of the PVD coated cores were compared to those of uncoated cores made of AISI H11. For both the cylindrical and quadratic cores, the as-deposited CrN and CrAlN films exhibit higher ejection forces than the uncoated cores due to the increase of the roughness profile after sputtering. It is known that the ejection forces are directly related to the surface roughness. In order to ensure comparable surface conditions to the uncoated surfaces, and to demonstrate the potential of PVD coated mold surfaces when reducing the ejection forces, the coated surfaces were mechanically post-treated to obtain a similar roughness profile as the uncoated cores. The combination of a PVD deposition and post-treatment ensures a significant reduction of the ejection forces by 22.6% and 23.7% for both core geometries.},

ABSTRACT = {In the drive towards a sustainable bio-economy, a growing interest exists in the development of composite materials using renewable natural resources. This paper explores the life cycle assessment of processing of Flax fibre reinforced polylactic acid (PLA), with a comparison of glass fibre triaxial fabric in the production process. The use of hydrocarbon fossil resources and synthetic fibres, such as glass and carbon, have caused severe environmental impacts in their entire life cycles. Whereas, Flax/PLA is one of the cornerstones for the sustainable economic growth of natural fibre composites. In this study, the manufacturing processes for the production of Flax/PLA tape and triaxial glass fibre were evaluated through a gate-to-gate life cycle assessment (LCA). The assessment was based on an input-output model to estimate energy demand and environmental impacts. The quality of the natural hybrid composite produced and cost-effectiveness of their LCA was dependent on their roving processing speeds and temperature applied to both the Flax/PLA tape and triaxial glass fabrics during processing. The optimum processing condition was found to be at a maximum of 4 m/min at a constant temperature of 170 °C. In contrast, the optimum for normal triaxial glass fibre production was at a slower speed of 1 m/min using a roving glass fibre laminating machine. The results showed that when the Flax and PLA were combined to produce new composite material in the form of a flax/PLA tape, energy consumption was 0.25 MJ/kg, which is lower than the 0.8 MJ/kg used for glass fibre fabric process. Flax/PLA tape and glass fibre fabric composites have a carbon footprint equivalent to 0.036 kg CO2 and 0.11 kg CO2, respectively, under the same manufacturing conditions. These are within the technical requirements in the composites industry. The manufacturing process adopted to transform Flax/PLA into a similar tape composite was considerably quicker than that of woven glass fibre fabric for composite tape. This work elucidated the relationship of the energy consumptions of the two materials processes by using a standard LCA analytical methodology. The outcomes supported an alternative option for replacement of some conventional composite materials for the automotive industry. Most importantly, the natural fibre composite production is shown to result in an economic benefit and reduced environmental impact.},

ABSTRACT = {This work presents a new methodology for machine tools anomaly detection via operational data processing. The previous methodology has been field tested on a milling-boring machine in a real production environment. This paper also describes the data acquisition process, as well as the technical architecture needed for data processing. Subsequently, a technique for operational machine data segmentation based on dynamic time warping and hierarchical clustering is introduced. The formerly mentioned data segmentation and analysis technique allows for machine tools anomaly detection thanks to comparison between near real-time machine operational information, coming from strategically positioned sensors and outcomes collected from previous production cycles. Anomaly detection techniques shown in this article could achieve significant production improvements: “zero-defect manufacturing”, boosting factory efficiency, production plans scrap minimization, improvement of product quality, and the enhancement of overall equipment productivity.},

ABSTRACT = {Spherical powders with single-mode (D50 = 36.31 µm), and bimodal (D50,L = 36.31 µm, D50,s = 5.52 µm) particle size distribution were used in selective laser melting of 316L stainless steel in nitrogen atmosphere at volumetric energy densities ranging from 35.7–116.0 J/mm3. Bimodal particle size distribution could provide up to 2% greater tap density than single-mode powder. For low laser power (107–178 W), where relative density was <99%, bimodal feedstock resulted in higher density than single-mode feedstock. However, at higher power (>203 W), the density of bimodal-fed components decreased as the energy density increased due to vaporizing of the fine powder in bimodal distributions. Size of intergranular cell regions did not appear to vary significantly between single-mode and bimodal specimens (0.394–0.531 µm2 at 81–116 J/mm3). Despite higher packing densities in powder feedstock with bimodal particle size distribution, the results of this study suggest that differences in conduction melting and vaporization points between the two primary particle sizes would limit the maximum achievable density of additively manufactured components produced from bimodal powder size distribution.},

ABSTRACT = {Industry 4.0 requires phenomenon twins to functionalize the relevant systems (e.g., cyber-physical systems). A phenomenon twin means a computable virtual abstraction of a real phenomenon. In order to systematize the construction process of a phenomenon twin, this study proposes a system defined as the phenomenon twin construction system. It consists of three components, namely the input, processing, and output components. Among these components, the processing component is the most critical one that digitally models, simulates, and validates a given phenomenon extracting information from the input component. What kind of modeling, simulation, and validation approaches should be used while constructing the processing component for a given phenomenon is a research question. This study answers this question using the case of surface roughness—a complex phenomenon associated with all material removal processes. Accordingly, this study shows that for modeling the surface roughness of a machined surface, the approach called semantic modeling is more effective than the conventional approach called the Markov chain. It is also found that to validate whether or not a simulated surface roughness resembles the expected roughness, the outcomes of the possibility distribution-based computing and DNA-based computing are more effective than the outcomes of a conventional computing wherein the arithmetic mean height of surface roughness is calculated. Thus, apart from the conventional computing approaches, the leading edge computational intelligence-based approaches can digitize manufacturing processes more effectively.},

To address this problem, a new time-efficient microstructure prediction algorithm was proposed in this study for the laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) process. Based on a combination of the melt pool modeling and the design of experiment approaches, this algorithm was used to predict the microstructure (grain size/aspect ratio) of materials processed by an EOS M280 LPBF system, including Iron and IN625 alloys. This approach was successfully validated using experimental and literature data, thus demonstrating its potential efficiency for the optimization of different LPBF powders and systems.},

ABSTRACT = {A drastically growing requirement of electronic packages with an increasing level of complexity poses newer challenges for the competitive manufacturing industry. Coupled with harsher operating conditions, these challenges affirm the need for encapsulated board-level (2nd level) packages. To reduce thermo-mechanical loads induced on the electronic components during operating cycles, a conformal type of encapsulation is gaining preference over conventional glob-tops or resin casting types. The availability of technology, the ease of automation, and the uncomplicated storage of raw material intensifies the implementation of thermoset injection molding for the encapsulation process of board-level packages. Reliability case studies of such encapsulated electronic components as a part of board-level packages become, thereupon, necessary. This paper presents the reliability study of exemplary electronic components, surface-mounted on printed circuit boards (PCBs), encapsulated by the means of thermoset injection molding, and subjected to cyclic thermal loading. The characteristic lifetime of the electronic components is statistically calculated after assessing the probability plots and presented consequently. A few points of conclusion are summarized, and the future scope is discussed at the end.},

ABSTRACT = {In conventional forming processes, quasi-static conditions are a good approximation and numerical process optimization is the state of the art in industrial practice. Nevertheless, there is still a substantial need for research in the field of identification of material parameters. In production technologies with high forming velocities, it is no longer acceptable to neglect the dependency of the hardening on the forming speed. Therefore, a method for determining material characteristics in processes with high forming speeds was developed by designing and implementing a test setup and an inverse parameter identification. Two acceleration concepts were realized: a pneumatically driven one and an electromagnetically driven one. The method was verified for a mild steel and an aluminum alloy proving that the identified material parameters allow numerical modeling of high-speed processes with good accuracy. The determined material parameters for steel show significant differences for different stress states. For specimen geometries with predominantly uniaxial tensile strain at forming speeds in the order of 104–105/s the determined yield stress was nearly twice as high compared to shear samples; an effect which does not occur under quasi-static loading. This trend suggests a triaxiality-dependent rate dependence, which might be attributed to shear band induced strain localization and adiabatic heating.},

ABSTRACT = {The increasing demand for complex and wear-resistant forming tools made of difficult-to-machine materials requires efficient manufacturing processes. In terms of high-strength materials; highly suitable processes such as micromilling are limited in their potential due to the increased tool loads and the resulting tool wear. This promotes hybrid manufacturing processes that offer approaches to increase the performance. In this paper; conduction-based thermally assisted micromilling using a prototype device to homogeneously heat the entire workpiece is investigated. By varying the workpiece temperature by 20 °C < TW < 500 °C; a highly durable high-speed steel (HSS) AISI M3:2 (63 HRC) and a hot-work steel (HWS) AISI H11 (53 HRC) were machined using PVD-TiAlN coated micro-end milling tools (d = 1 mm). The influence of the workpiece temperature on central process conditions; such as tool wear and achievable surface quality; are determined. As expected; the temporary thermal softening of the materials leads to a reduction in the cutting forces and; thus; in the resulting tool wear for specific configurations of the thermal assistance. While only minor effects are detected regarding the surface topography; a significant reduction in the burr height is achieved.},

ABSTRACT = {Fused filament fabrication (FFF) is a cost-effective additive manufacturing method that makes use of thermoplastics to produce customised products. However, there are several limitations associated with FFF that are adversely affecting its growth including variety of materials, rough surface finish and poor mechanical properties. This has resulted in the development of metal-infused thermoplastics that can provide better properties. Furthermore, FFF-printed parts can be subjected to post-processes to improve their surface finish and mechanical properties. This work takes into consideration two commonly used polymeric materials, i.e., ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene) and PLA (polylactic acid) and compares the results with two metal-infused thermoplastics i.e., copper-enhanced PLA and aluminium-enhanced ASA (acrylonitrile styrene acrylate). The four different materials were subjected to a post-process called annealing to enhance their mechanical properties. The effect of annealing on these four materials was investigated through dimensional analysis, ultrasonic testing, tensile testing, microstructural analysis and hardness testing. The results showed that annealing affects the materials differently. However, a correlation among ultrasonic testing, tensile testing and microstructural analysis was observed for all the materials based on their crystallinity. It was found that the semi-crystalline materials (i.e., PLA and copper enhanced PLA) showed a considerable increase in tensile strength post-annealing. However, the amorphous materials (ABS and aluminium-enhanced ASA) showed a comparatively lower increase in tensile strength, demonstrating that they were less receptive to annealing. These results were supported by higher transmission times and a high percentage of voids in the amorphous materials. The highest hardness values were observed for the ASA material and the lowest for the ABS material. This work provides a good comparison for the metal-infused thermoplastics and their applicability with the commonly used PLA and ABS materials.},

The design of experiments method (DOE) was used and nine models of the same size were fabricated in a low-cost 3D printer using polylactic acid (PLA) material. Two limited studied parameters were considered (extraction temperature and wall thickness), each one having three levels. External X and Y dimensions were measured using a micrometer, as well as four surface roughness parameters (Ra, Rz, Rt, Rsm) with a surface tester. Two optimization techniques (the Taguchi approach and Grey relational analysis) were utilized along with statistical analysis to examine how the temperature and wall thickness affect the dimensional accuracy and the surface quality of the parts. The results showed that high extraction temperature and median wall thickness values optimize both dimensional accuracy and surface roughness, while temperature is the most important factor.},

ABSTRACT = {Deep hole boring using slender bars that have tuned mass dampers integrated within them make the boring process chatter vibration resistant. Dampers are usually designed using classical analytical solutions that presume the (un)damped boring bar which can be approximated by a single degree of freedom system, and the damper is placed at the free end. Since the free end is also the cutting end, analytical models may result in infeasible design solutions. To place optimally tuned dampers within boring bars, but away from the free end, this paper presents a receptance coupling approach in which the substructural receptances of the boring bar modelled as a cantilevered Euler–Bernoulli beam are combined with the substructural receptances of a damper modelled as a rigid mass integrated anywhere within the bar. The assembled and damped system response thus obtained is used to predict the chatter-free machining stability limit. Maximization of this limit is treated as the objective function to find the optimal mass, stiffness and damping of the absorber. Proposed solutions are first verified against other classical solutions for assumed placement of the absorber at the free end. Verified models then guide prototyping of a boring bar integrated with a damper placed away from its free end. Experiments demonstrate a ~100-fold improvement in chatter vibration free machining capability. The generalized methods presented herein can be easily extended to design and develop other damped and chatter-resistant tooling systems.},

ABSTRACT = {The purpose of machining operations is to make specific shapes or surface characteristics for a product. Conditions for machining operations were traditionally selected based on geometry and surface finish requirements. However, nowadays, many researchers are optimizing machining parameters since high-quality products can be produced using more expensive and advanced machines and tools. There are a few methods to optimize the machining process, such as minimizing unit production time or cost or maximizing profit. This research focused on maximizing the profit of computer numerical control (CNC) milling operations by optimizing machining parameters. Cutting speeds and feed are considered as the main process variables to maximize the profit of CNC milling operations as they have the greatest effect on machining operation. In this research, the Nelder–Mead simplex method was used to maximize the profit of CNC milling processes by optimizing machining parameters. The Nelder–Mead simplex method was used to calculate best, worst, and second-worst value based on an initial guess. The possible range of machining parameters was limited by several constraints. The Nelder–Mead simplex method yielded a profit of 3.45 ($/min) when applied to a commonly used case study model.},

ABSTRACT = {Lightweight structures in the automotive and transportation industry are increasingly researched. Multiple materials with tailored properties are integrated into structures via a large spectrum of joining techniques. Welding is a viable solution in mass scale production in an automotive sector still dominated by steels, although hybrid structures involving other materials like aluminum are becoming increasingly important. The welding of dissimilar metals is difficult if not impossible, due to their differential thermo mechanical properties along with the formation of intermetallic compounds, particularly when fusion welding is envisioned. Solid-state welding, as with magnetic pulse welding, is of particular interest due to its short processing cycles. However, electromagnetic pulse welding is constrained by the selection of processing parameters, particularly the coil design and its life cycle. This paper investigates two inductor designs, a linear (I) and O shape, for the joining of sheet metals involving aluminum and steels. The O shape inductor is found to be more efficient both with magnetic pulse (MPW) and magnetic pulse spot welding (MPSW) and offers a better life cycle. Both simulation and experimental mechanical tests are presented to support the effect of inductor design on the process performance.},

ABSTRACT = {Titanium alloy Ti6Al4V is a difficult-to-machine material which is extensively used in the aerospace and medical industries. Machining titanium is associated with a short tool life and low productivity. In this paper, a new cooling-lubrication system based on electrohydrodynamic atomization was designed, manufactured and tested and the relevant theory was developed. The major novelty of the system lies within the use of electrohydrodynamic atomization (EHDA) and a three-electrode setup for generating lubricant droplets. The system was tested and compared with that of flood, minimum quantity lubrication (MQL) and compressed air machining. The proposed system can extend the tool life by 6 and 22 times when compared with MQL and flood cooling, respectively. This is equivalent to more than 170 min tool life at 120 m/min cutting speed allowing for significant productivity gains in machining Ti6Al4V.},

ABSTRACT = {Due to their flexibility, low cost and large working volume, 6-axis articulated industrial robots are increasingly being used for drilling, trimming and machining operations, especially in aerospace manufacturing. However, producing high quality components has demonstrated to be difficult, as a result of the inherent problems of robots, including low structural stiffness and low positional accuracy. These limit robotic machining to non-critical components and parts with low accuracy and surface finish requirements. Studies have been carried out to improve robotic machine capability, specifically positioning accuracy and vibration reduction. This study includes the description of the hardware, software and methodologies developed to compensate robot path errors in real time using a single three-degrees-of-freedom (DOF) laser tracker, as well as the experimental results with and without compensation. Performance tests conducted include ballbar dynamic path accuracy test, a series of drilling case studies and a machining test. The results demonstrate major improvements in path accuracy, hole position accuracy and hole quality, as well as increases in accuracy of a machined aluminum part.},

ABSTRACT = {Micrographic image analysis, tomography and the Archimedes method are commonly used to analyze the porosity of Selective Laser Melting (SLM)-produced parts and then to estimate the relative density. This article deals with the limitation of the relative density results to conclude on the quality of a part manufactured by additive manufacturing and focuses on the interpretation of the relative density result. To achieve this aim, two experimental methods are used: the image analysis method, which provides local information on the distribution of porosity, and the Archimedes method, which provides access to global information. To investigate this, two different grades of aluminum alloy, AlSi7Mg0.6 and AM205, were used in this study. The study concludes that an analysis of the metallographic images to calculate the relative density of the part depends on the areas chosen for the analysis. In addition, the results show that the Archimedes method has limitations, particularly related to the choice of reference materials for calculating relative density. It can be observed, for example, that, depending on the experimental conditions, the calculation can lead to relative densities higher than 100%, which is inconsistent. This article shows that it is essential that a result of relative density obtained from Archimedes measurements be supplemented by an indication of the reference density used.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper presents a framework to utilize multivariate time series data to automatically identify reoccurring events, e.g., resembling failure patterns in real-world manufacturing data by combining selected data mining techniques. The use case revolves around the auxiliary polymer manufacturing process of drying and feeding plastic granulate to extrusion or injection molding machines. The overall framework presented in this paper includes a comparison of two different approaches towards the identification of unique patterns in the real-world industrial data set. The first approach uses a subsequent heuristic segmentation and clustering approach, the second branch features a collaborative method with a built-in time dependency structure at its core (TICC). Both alternatives have been facilitated by a standard principle component analysis PCA (feature fusion) and a hyperparameter optimization (TPE) approach. The performance of the corresponding approaches was evaluated through established and commonly accepted metrics in the field of (unsupervised) machine learning. The results suggest the existence of several common failure sources (patterns) for the machine. Insights such as these automatically detected events can be harnessed to develop an advanced monitoring method to predict upcoming failures, ultimately reducing unplanned machine downtime in the future.},

ABSTRACT = {The implementation of Industry 4.0 and smart factory concepts changes the ways of manufacturing and production and requires the combination and interaction of different technologies and systems. The need for rapid implementation is steadily increasing as customers demand individualized products which are only possible if the production unit is smart and flexible. However, an existing factory cannot be transformed easily into a smart factory, especially not during operational mode. Therefore, designers and engineers require solutions which help to simulate the aspired change beforehand, thus running realistic pre-tests without disturbing operations and production. New product lines may also be tested beforehand. Data and the deduced knowledge are key factors of the said transformation. One idea for simulation is applying artificial intelligence, in this case the method of multi-agent-systems (MAS), to simulate the inter-dependencies of different production units based on individually configured orders. Once the smart factory is running additional machine learning methods for feedback data of the different machine units may be applied for generating knowledge for improvement of processes and decision making. This paper describes the necessary interaction of manufacturing and knowledge-based solutions before showing an MAS use case implementation of a production line using Anylogic.},

ABSTRACT = {The design and development of composite structures requires precise and robust manufacturing processes. Composite materials such as fiber reinforced thermoplastics (FRTP) provide a good balance between manufacturing time, mechanical performance and weight. In this contribution, we investigate the process combination of thermoforming FRTP sheets (organo sheets) and injection overmolding of short FRTP for automotive structures. The limiting factor in those structures is the bond strength between the organo sheet and the overmolded thermoplastic. Within this process chain, even small deviations of the process settings (e.g., temperature) can lead to significant defects in the structure. A cyber physical production system based framework for a digital twin combining simulation and machine learning is presented. Based on parametric Finite-Element-Method (FEM) studies, training data for machine learning methods are generated and a FEM surrogate is developed. A comparison of different data-driven methods yields information on the estimation accuracy of task-specific data-driven methods. Finally, in accordance with experimental cross tension tests, the investigated FEM surrogate model is able to predict the interface bond strength quality in dependence of the process settings. The visualization into different quality domains qualifies the presented approach as decision support.},

ABSTRACT = {Cyber-physical production systems (CPPS) and digital twins (DT) with a data-driven core enable retrospective analyses of acquired data to achieve a pervasive system understanding and can further support prospective operational management in production systems. Cost pressure and environmental compliances sensitize facility operators for energy and resource efficiency within the whole life cycle while achieving reliability requirements. In manufacturing systems, technical building services (TBS) such as cooling towers (CT) are drivers of resource demands while they fulfil a vital mission to keep the production running. Data-driven approaches, such as data mining (DM), help to support operators in their daily business. Within this paper the development of a data-driven DT for TBS operation is presented and applied on an industrial CT case study located in Germany. It aims to improve system understanding and performance prediction as essentials for a successful operational management. The approach comprises seven consecutive steps in a broadly applicable workflow based on the CRISP-DM paradigm. Step by step, the workflow is explained including a tailored data pre-processing, transformation and aggregation as well as feature selection procedure. The graphical presentation of interim results in portfolio diagrams, heat maps and Sankey diagrams amongst others to enhance the intuitive understanding of the procedure. The comparative evaluation of selected DM algorithms confirms a high prediction accuracy for cooling capacity (R2 = 0.96) by using polynomial regression and electric power demand (R2 = 0.99) by linear regression. The results are evaluated graphically and the transfer into industrial practice is discussed conclusively.},

In this context, the development of technologies such as advanced analytics and cyber physical production systems offer a promising approach. This paper discusses and defines essential elements of virtual quality gates in the context of manufacturing systems. To support the planning and implementation of virtual quality gates, a morphological box is developed which can be used to identify and derive an individual approach for a virtual quality gate based on the specific characteristics and requirements of the respective manufacturing system. Moreover, the framework is exemplified by three case studies from various industries and resulting potential are discussed.},

ABSTRACT = {The performance indicator, Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE), is one of the most important ones for production control, as it merges information of equipment usage, process yield, and product quality. The determination of the OEE is oftentimes not transparent in companies, due to the heterogeneous data sources and manual interference. Furthermore, there is a difference in present guidelines to calculate the OEE. Due to a big amount of sensor data in Cyber Physical Production Systems, Machine Learning methods can be used in order to detect several elements of the OEE by a trained model. Changeover time is one crucial aspect influencing the OEE, as it adds no value to the product. Furthermore, changeover processes are fulfilled manually and vary from worker to worker. They always have their own procedure to conduct a changeover of a machine for a new product or production lot. Hence, the changeover time as well as the process itself vary. Thus, a new Machine Learning based concept for identification and characterization of machine set-up actions is presented. Here, the issue to be dealt with is the necessity of human and machine interaction to fulfill the entire machine set-up process. Because of this, the paper shows the use case in a real production scenario of a small to medium size company (SME), the derived data set, promising Machine Learning algorithms, as well as the results of the implemented Machine Learning model to classify machine set-up actions.},

ABSTRACT = {Lean production principles have greatly contributed to the efficient and customer-oriented mass production of goods and services. A core element of lean production is the focus on cycle times and designing production controls and buffers around any bottlenecks in the system. Hence, a production line organized by lean principles will operate in a static or at least quasi-static way. While the individualization of products is an interesting business approach, it can influence cycle times and in-time production. This work demonstrates how performance losses induced by highly variable cycle times can be recovered using a digital twin. The unit under analysis is an industrial joiner’s workshop. Due to the high variance in cycle time, the joinery fails its production target, even if all machines are below 80% usage. Using a discrete event simulation of the production line, different production strategies can be evaluated efficiently and systematically. It is successfully shown that the performance losses due to the highly variable cycle times can be compensated using a digital twin in combination with optimization strategies. This is achieved by operating the system in a non-static mode, exploiting the flexibilities within the systems.},

ABSTRACT = {Laser directed energy deposition (LDED) was used with a powder blend comprising 75 wt.% Rene 142 and 25 wt.% of Merl 72 (4275M72) for turbine blade tip repair applications. Sound samples could be deposited at ambient temperature on Haynes 230. The microstructural analyses showed the presence of fine gamma prime precipitates in the as-deposited samples, while after aging, the alloy possessed around 40 vol.% with a bimodal precipitate size distribution. Also, the alloy contained Ta-Hf-W carbides in different sizes and shapes. Tensile testing from room temperature up to 1366 K was performed. The 4275M72 deposits possessed higher tensile properties compared to Rene 80 in this temperature range but lower elongations at the elevated temperatures. The creep properties of 4275M72 samples at 1255 K were superior to Rene 80. Also, the oxidation resistance of deposited 4275M72 was similar to Rene 142. The combination of high mechanical properties, creep behavior, and oxidation resistance of LDEDed 4275M72 makes it a suitable alloy for tip repair of turbine blades.},

ABSTRACT = {The successful and efficient production of parts with specific features by Wire + Arc Additive Manufacturing (WAAM) strongly depends on the selection of proper and typically interrelated deposition parameters. This task might be particularly challenging in the making of thin walls, which might be highly impacted by processing conditions and heat accumulation. In this context, this study aims at expanding the work envelope and optimizing the parametric conditions in WAAM with relative density and surface aspects of the preforms as quality constraints. The experimental approach was based on the deposition of thin Al5Mg walls by the CMT process on its standard welding setup and with an active cooling technique to enhance the deposition robustness. Internal voids were estimated by Archimedes’ method. The surface quality of the walls was assessed through the visual aspect and the surface waviness by cross-section analysis. All the conditions presented relative density higher than 98%. The upgrade of the standard welding hardware to WAAM purposes through the addition of a supplementary shielding gas nozzle to the torch and the intensity of the heat sinking from the part significantly expanded the process work envelope, with its applicability being successfully demonstrated with multi-objective optimization. To sum up, a decision-making procedure is presented towards achieving intended preform quality.},

ABSTRACT = {Vacuum drying can dehydrate materials further than dry heat methods, while protecting sensitive materials from thermal degradation. Many industries have shifted to vacuum drying as cost- or time-saving measures. Small-scale vacuum drying, however, has been limited by the high costs of specialty scientific tools. To make vacuum drying more accessible, this study provides design and performance information for a small-scale open source vacuum oven, which can be fabricated from off-the-shelf and 3-D printed components. The oven is tested for drying speed and effectiveness on both waste plastic polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and a consortium of bacteria developed for bioprocessing of terephthalate wastes to assist in distributed recycling of PET for both additive manufacturing as well as potential food. Both materials can be damaged when exposed to high temperatures, making vacuum drying a desirable solution. The results showed that the open source vacuum oven was effective at drying both plastic and biomaterials, drying at a higher rate than a hot-air dryer for small samples or for low volumes of water. The system can be constructed for less than 20% of commercial vacuum dryer costs for several laboratory-scale applications, including dehydration of bio-organisms, drying plastic for distributed recycling and additive manufacturing, and chemical processing.},

ABSTRACT = {Ultrasonic welding of titanium alloy Ti6Al4V to carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) at 20 kHz frequency requires suitable welding tools, so called sonotrodes. The basic function of ultrasonic welding sonotrodes is to oscillate with displacement amplitudes typically up to 50 µm at frequencies close to the eigenfrequency of the oscillation unit. Material properties, the geometry of the sonotrode, and the sonotrode tip topography together determine the longevity of the sonotrode. Durable sonotrodes for ultrasonic welding of high-strength joining partners, e.g., titanium alloys, have not been investigated so far. In this paper, finite element simulations were used to establish a suitable design assuring the oscillation of a longitudinal eigenmode at the operation frequency of the welding machine and to calculate local mechanical stresses. The primary aim of this work is to design a sonotrode that can be used to join high-strength materials such as Ti6Al4V by ultrasonic welding considering the longevity of the welding tools and high-strength joints. Material, sonotrode geometry, and sonotrode tip topography were designed and investigated experimentally to identify the most promising sonotrode design for continuous ultrasonic welding of Ti6AlV4 and CFRP. Eigenfrequency and modal shape were measured in order to examine the reliability of the calculations and to compare the performance of all investigated sonotrodes.},

ABSTRACT = {Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) is a promising technology for production of fiber-reinforced composite parts with complex geometries. Continuous Fiber Reinforced Additively Manufactured (CFRAM) parts are becoming more prominent due to their mechanical performance, light weight, and recyclability. CFRAM components are lighter, yet they are strong materials with a wide range of potential applications in the automotive industry, aerospace, medical tools, and sports goods. The wide range of applications of these novel materials justifies the need to study their properties. Tensile is one of the most important tests to evaluate the mechanical performance of CFRAM parts. In this paper, a comprehensive study is conducted on tensile properties of CFRAM components. The composite parts are printed using a dual nozzle 3D printing machine and their tensile performance is investigated. Furthermore, the effect of fiber type, fiber content, infill density, infill pattern, and layer thickness on tensile properties was studied. Nylon was used as the matrix and Carbon fiber (CF), fiberglass (FG), and Kevlar were used as reinforcing agents. Microstructural analysis was conducted to investigate the fracture mechanism, internal morphology, interlayer adhesion, and the printing quality of specimens. Finally, a comparative study is conducted on the price and printing time of CFRAM parts. It is observed that fiber inclusion increases the tensile strength up to 2200%; moreover, increasing the fiber content improves the tensile performance of composite. The results obtained demonstrate that CF-reinforced parts have better performance compared to FG and Kevlar-reinforced components. The results show that CFRAM parts have potential to replace metals and conventional composites for engineering applications like the automobile industry.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper presents a brief introduction to competition-driven digital transformation in the machining sector. On this basis, the creation of a digital twin for machining processes is approached firstly using a basic digital twin structure. The latter is sub-grouped into information and data models, specific calculation and process models, all seen from an application-oriented perspective. Moreover, digital shadow and digital twin are embedded in this framework, being discussed in the context of a state-of-the-art literature review. The main part of this paper addresses models for machine and path inaccuracies, material removal and tool engagement, cutting force, process stability, thermal behavior, workpiece and surface properties. Furthermore, these models are superimposed towards an integral digital twin. In addition, the overall context is expanded towards an integral software architecture of a digital twin providing information system. The information system, in turn, ties in with existing forward-oriented planning from operational practice, leading to a significant expansion of the initially presented basic structure for a digital twin. Consequently, a time-stratified data layer platform is introduced to prepare for the resulting shadow-twin transformation loop. Finally, subtasks are defined to assure functional interfaces, model integrability and feedback measures.},

The next trend in mechanical engineering design is the adaption of design strategies that build products with lightweight lattice geometries like sandwich structures. These structures possess low mass, large surface area to volume ratio, high porosity, and adequate mechanical behavior, which are properties of great importance in scientific fields such as bioengineering, automotive, and aerospace engineering. The present work is focused on producing sandwich structures with complex lattice patterns like the Triply Periodic Minimal Surface (TPMS) Schwarz diamond structure. The specimens were manufactured with two different Additive Manufacturing procedures employing various relative densities. More specifically, Material Jetting Printing (MJP) and Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) processes were employed to investigate the performance of Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) lightweight lattice structures. These structures were examined using digital microscopy in order to measure the dimensional accuracy and the surface characteristics of the utilized AM technologies. Furthermore, three-point bending tests and finite elements analyses have been applied to investigate the mechanical performance of the proposed technologies and designs as well as the influence of the relative density on the Schwarz diamond TPMS structure. The experimental results demonstrate that the investigated structure possesses a remarkable performance in respect to its weight due to the specific distribution of its material in space.},

ABSTRACT = {Hybrid manufacturing is often used to describe a combination of additive and subtractive processes in the same build envelope. In this research study, hybrid manufacturing of 18Ni-300 maraging steel was investigated using a Matsuura LUMEX Avance-25 system that integrates metal additive manufacturing using laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) processing with high-speed machining. A series of benchmarking coupons were additively printed at four different power levels (160 W, 240 W, 320 W, 380 W) and with the integration of sequential machining passes after every 10 deposited layers, as well as final finishing of selected surfaces. Using non-contact three-dimensional laser scanning, inspection of the final geometry of the 18Ni-300 maraging steel coupons against the computer-aided design (CAD) model indicated the good capability of the Matsuura LUMEX Avance-25 system for net-shape manufacturing. Linear and areal roughness measurements of the surfaces showed average Ra/Sa values of 8.02–14.64 µm for the as-printed walls versus 0.32–0.80 µm for the machined walls/faces. Using Archimedes and helium (He) gas pycnometry methods, the part density was measured to be lowest for coupons produced at 160 W (relative density of 93.3–98.5%) relative to those at high power levels of 240 W to 380 W (relative density of 99.0–99.8%). This finding agreed well with the results of the porosity size distribution determined through X-ray micro-computed tomography (µCT). Evaluation of the static tensile properties indicated that the coupons manufactured at the lowest power of 160 W were ~30% lower in strength, 24% lower in stiffness, and more than 80% lower in ductility relative to higher power conditions (240 W to 380 W) due to the lower density at 160 W.},

ABSTRACT = {It is known that 3D printing can facilitate greater design flexibility in the printing of custom shapes for packaging and construction applications using biomass–fungi composite materials. The feasibility of this new method was demonstrated by a preliminary experiment, the results of which were reported in a journal publication in 2020. As a follow-up, this paper reports on an experimental study on the relationship between the mixture composition (i.e., the psyllium husk powder content) and print quality using this new method. Four mixtures were prepared by varying the amounts of psyllium husk powder (in grams) added to 400 mL of water. The ratios (g/mL) of psyllium husk powder weight (wp) over volume of water (vw) for the mixtures were 0, 1:40, 2:40, and 3:40. Each mixture also contained 100 g of biomass–fungi material and 40 g of whole wheat flour. The print quality of the samples was evaluated based on the extrudability and shape stability. The results showed that mixtures without any psyllium husk powder were not extrudable. An increase in the ratio of psyllium husk powder to water from 1:40 to 2:40 resulted in improved print quality; however, when the psyllium husk powder to water ratio was increased to 3:40, the extrudability became worse. This phenomenon was explained by analyzing the rheological properties of the mixtures.},

ABSTRACT = {Due to their unique advantages over traditional manufacturing processes, metal additive manufacturing (AM) technologies have received a great deal of attention over the last few years. Using current powder-bed fusion AM technologies, metal components are very expensive to manufacture, and machines are complex to build and maintain. Wire arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) is a new method of producing metallic components with high efficiency at an affordable cost, which combines welding and 3D printing. In this work, gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW) is incorporated into a gantry system to create a new metal additive manufacturing platform. Design and build of a simple, affordable, and effective WAAM system is explained and the most frequently seen problems are discussed with their suggested solutions. Effect of process parameters on the quality of two additively manufactured alloys including plain carbon steel and Inconel 718 were studied. System design and troubleshooting for the wire arc AM system is presented and discussed.},

ABSTRACT = {Inconel 718 is a precipitation strengthened, nickel-based super alloy of interest for the Additive Manufacturing (AM) of low volume, complex parts to reduce production time and cost compared to conventional subtractive processes. The AM process involves repeated rapid melting, solidification and reheating, which exposes the material to non-equilibrium conditions that affect elemental segregation and the subsequent formation of solidification phases, either beneficial or detrimental. These variations are difficult to characterize due to the small length scale within the micron sized melt pool. To understand how the non-equilibrium conditions affect the initial solidification phases and their critical temperatures, a multi-length scale, multi modal approach has been taken to evaluate various methods for identifying the initial phases formed in the as-built Inconel 718 produced by laser-powder bed fusion (L-PBF) additive manufacturing (AM). Using a range of characterization tools from the bulk differential thermal analysis (DTA) and x-ray diffraction (XRD) to spatially resolved images using a variety of electron microscopy tools, a better understanding is obtained of how these minor phases can be properly identified regarding the amount and size, morphology and distribution. Using the most promising characterization techniques for investigation of the as-built specimens, those techniques were used to evaluate the specimens after various heat treatments. During the sequence of heat treatments, the initial as-built dendritic structures recrystallized into well-defined grains whose size was dependent on the temperature. Although the resulting strength was similar in all heat treated specimens, the elongation increased as the grain size was refined due to differences in the precipitated phase distribution and morphology.},

ABSTRACT = {To better support the transition to more industrial uses of additive manufacturing, this study examined the use of an Arcam Q20+ industrial 3D printer for producing heavily nested Ti-6Al-4V parts with both in-specification (IS) and out of specification (OS) oxygen content in reused grade 5 powder chemistries. Both the OS and IS powder chemistries were evaluated to understand their impact on build integrity and on static and fatigue performance. The results from our evaluations showed that controlling the bed preheat temperature in the Q20+ to relatively low values (326–556 °C) was effective in limiting microstructural coarsening during the long build time and enabled adequate/balanced performance vis à vis the tensile strength and ductility. Overall, the tensile properties of the IS Ti-6Al-4V material in the as-built and machined states fully met the requirements of ASTM F2924-14. By contrast, the ductility was compromised at oxygen levels above 0.2 wt.% (OS) in Ti-6Al-4V produced by EBM. Removal of the surface layer by machining increased the consistency and performance of the IS and OS Ti-6Al-4V materials. The fatigue behaviour of the EBM Ti-6Al-4V material was in the range of properties produced by casting. Due to the strong influence of both the surface finish and oxygen content on the fatigue strength, the IS Ti-6Al-4V material exhibited the highest performance, with results that were in the range of parts that had been cast plus hot isostatically pressed.},

ABSTRACT = {This research study investigated the hybrid processing of 316L stainless steel using laser powder bed (LPB) processing with high-speed machining in the same build envelope. Benchmarking at four laser powers (160 W, 240 W, 320 W, and 380 W) was undertaken by building additively with machining passes integrated sequentially after every ten deposited layers, followed by the final finishing of select surfaces. The final geometry was inspected against the computer-aided design (CAD) model and showed deviations smaller than 280 µm for the as-built and machined surfaces, which demonstrate the good efficacy of hybrid processing for the net-shape manufacturing of stainless steel products. The arithmetic average roughness values for the printed surfaces, Ra (linear) and Sa (surface), were 11.4 um and 14.9 um, respectively. On the other hand, the vertical and horizontal machined surfaces had considerably lower roughness, with Ra and Sa values ranging between 0.33 µm and 0.70 µm. The 160 W coupon contained layered, interconnected lack of fusion defects which affected the density (7.84 g·cm−3), yield strength (494 MPa), ultimate tensile strength (604 MPa), Young’s modulus (175 GPa), and elongation at break (17.3%). By contrast, at higher laser powers, near-full density was obtained for the 240 W (7.96 g·cm−3), 320 W (7.94 g·cm−3), and 380 W (7.92 g·cm−3) conditions. This, combined with the isolated nature of the small pores, led to the tensile properties surpassing the requirements stipulated in ASTM F3184—16 for 316L stainless steel.},

ABSTRACT = {Nowadays, in the domain of production logistics, one of the most complex planning processes is the accurate forecasting of production and assembly efficiency. In industrial companies, Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) is one of the most common used efficiency measures at semi-automatic assembly lines. Proper estimation supports the right use of resources and more accurate and cost-effective delivery to the customers. This paper presents the prediction of OEE by comparing human prediction with one of the techniques of supervised machine learning through a real-life example. In addition to descriptive statistics, takt time-based decision trees are applied and the target-oriented OEE prediction model is presented. This concept takes into account recent data and assembly line targets with different weights. Using the model, the value of OEE can be predicted with an accuracy of within 1% on a weekly basis, four weeks in advance.},

ABSTRACT = {Flange wrinkling is often seen in deep-drawing process when the applied blankholding force is too small. This paper investigates the plastic wrinkling of flange under a constant blankholding force. A series of deep-drawing experiments of AA1100-O blanks are conducted with different blankholding forces. The critical cup height and wrinkling wave numbers for each case is established. A reduced-order model of flange wrinkling is developed using the energy method, which is implemented to predict the flange wrinkling of AA1100-O sheet by incrementally updating the flange geometry and material hardening parameters during the drawing process. A deep-drawing finite element model is developed in ABAQUS/standard to simulate the flange wrinkling of AA1100-O blanks under constant blankholding force. The predicted cup height and wave numbers from the finite element model and reduced-order model are compared with the experimental results, which demonstrates the accuracy of the reduced-order model, and its potential application in fast prediction of wrinkling in deep-drawing process.},

ABSTRACT = {Determination of the shear angle by experimental and analytical methods, as well as by numerical simulation, is presented. Experimental determination of the shear angle was performed by analyzing the chip roots obtained by the method of cutting process quick stop through purposeful fracture of the workpiece in the area surrounding the primary cutting zone. The analytical determination of the shear angle was carried out using the chip compression ratio and was based on the principle of a potential energy minimum. Measurement of the shear angle in the numerical simulation of orthogonal cutting was performed using the strain rate pattern of the machined material at the selected simulation moment. It was analyzed how the parameters of the Johnson–Cook constitutive equation and the friction model affect the shear angle value. The parameters with a predominant effect on the shear angle were determined. Then the generalized values of these parameters were established with a software algorithm based on identifying the intersection of the constitutive equation parameter sets. The use of generalized parameters provided the largest deviation between experimental and simulated shear angle values from 9% to 18% and between simulated and analytically calculated shear angle values from 7% to 12%.},
