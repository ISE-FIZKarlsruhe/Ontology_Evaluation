In this work, a geometric model for surface generation of finish machining was developed in MATLAB, and subsequently verified by experimental surface roughness data gathered from turning tests in Ti-6Al4V. The present model predicts the behavior of surface roughness at multiple length scales, depending on feed, nose radius, tool edge radius, machine tool error, and material-dependent parameters—in particular, the minimum effective rake angle. Experimental tests were conducted on a commercial lathe with slightly modified conventional tooling to provide relevant results. Additionally, the model-predicted roughness was compared against pedigreed surface roughness data from previous efforts that included materials 51CrV4 and AL 1075. Previously obscure machine tool error effects have been identified and can be modeled within the proposed framework. Preliminary findings of the model’s relevance to subsurface properties have also been presented. The proposed model has been shown to accurately predict roughness values for both long and short surface roughness evaluation lengths, which implies its utility not only as a surface roughness prediction tool, but as a basis for understanding three-dimensional surface generation in ductile-machining materials, and the properties derived therefrom.
