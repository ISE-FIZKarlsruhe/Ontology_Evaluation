The approach is based on the coupling between two particle methods, namely smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) and discrete element method (DEM). The coupled SPH-DEM model has distinctive advantages in dealing with the free surface flow, large deformation of fibres, and/or fibre-fibre interaction that are involved in the FDM process. A numerical feasibility study is carried out to demonstrate its capability for both short and continuous fibre reinforced polymer composites, with promising results achieved for the rheological flow and fibre orientation and deformation.},

 abstract = {The traditional analytical cutting force prediction method for ball-end milling ignores the effect of the inclination angle on cutting forces. In this paper, a new experimental method for cutting force prediction methods considering the inclination angle in the ball-end milling process is proposed. First, the actual immersion ranges of cutter in the ball-end milling process with and without an inclination angle are analyzed by a geometrical method and the cutting force prediction model with an inclination angle is developed by a numerical integration method. Second, considering that entry and exit angles of cutting zones for different cutter layers vary due to the inclination angle, a milling force coefficients identification approach for different cutter layers is established by experimental calibration. Comparing the traditional analytical cutting force prediction method that ignores the inclination angle, the numerical simulation results show that the prediction force values calculated by the proposed method have a better consistency with the measured values.},

 abstract = {This paper evaluates a physics-based analytical model in the prediction of machining temperature of AISI 1045 steel and AISI 4340 steel. The prediction model was developed based on the Johnson-Cook constitutive model (J-C model) and mechanics of the orthogonal cutting process. The average temperatures at two shear zones were predicted by minimizing the difference between calculated stresses using the J-C model and calculated stresses using the mechanics model. In this work, (1) the influence of input Johnson-Cook model constants, cutting force, and chip thickness on the accuracy of predictions are investigated with sensitivity analyses, in which multiple sets of available J-C constants and varying cutting force and chip thickness are used for the temperature prediction in machining AISI 1045 steel. The larger the input deviation, the larger prediction deviation. The temperature at the primary shear zone is more susceptible to the deviation of inputs than the temperature at the secondary shear zone. (2) The machining temperatures are also predicted in machining AISI 4340 steel using cutting tools with various specifications to demonstrate its predictive capability. Good agreements are observed upon validation to available experimental data in the literature. (3) Lastly, the advantage and limitation of the temperature model are discussed with comparison other analytical temperature models. Considering the reliable and easily measurable input requirements and sufficient predictive capability, this temperature model can be employed for effective and efficient machining temperature prediction.},

 abstract = {Beam oscillation in laser material processing makes it possible to influence process behavior in terms of energy distribution, stability, melt pool dynamics and solidification. Within the setup presented here, the beam is oscillated transverse to the welding direction, and the filler wire is fed to the melt pool of a butt joint with an air gap. One advantage of this setup is the large gap bridging ability. Certain parameter sets lead to the so-called buttonhole welding method, which allows laser welding of smooth and nearly ripple-free seams. Observations showed a transition area between conventional keyhole and buttonhole welding in which the process is destabilized. Welds made with parameter sets from this area contain critical seam defects. Welding experiments with high-speed video recording and a simplified analytical model about the wire-beam interaction have helped to elucidate the mechanisms behind this. EN AW-6082 sheet material in 1.5 mm thickness and ML 4043 filler wire with 1.2 mm diameter were used. The investigations lead to the conclusion that partially melted wire segments result at certain parameter relations which hinder the formation of a buttonhole. If these segments are prevented, buttonhole welding occurs. In the transition area, these segments are very small and can lead to the detachment of a buttonhole, resulting in the named seam defects.},

 abstract = {Producing metallic bipolar plates for Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) fuel cells by forming is still a topic of research. So far, it has mainly been applied for small batches, but it offers substantial advantages regarding both costs and installation space compared to the established graphite based solutions. One new possibility for an efficient manufacturing process of these metallic bipolar plates is the forming by rolling. For the first time, this technology was used for relevant industrial scale channel geometries. By the use of an experimental rolling mill, 0.1 mm thick 316L (1.4404) stainless steel foils were roll-formed to achieve previously designed channel geometries within one rolling pass. The conducted experiments show promising results regarding the forming accuracy and the shape of the channel cross-sections. With the aim for a proof of concept in the beginning and a subsequent optimization of the process, a numerical simulation was set up prior to the real experiments and later calibrated with the experimental forming results. This calibrated model was used for further improvements of the process with the objective at reducing wrinkles and distortion. The investigation of this new process method for the manufacturing of metallic bipolar plates shows enormous potential and can lead to a more efficient and cheaper production.},

 abstract = {The use of lightweight material such as CFRP/Ti6Al4V in stacked structures in the aerospace industry is associated with improved physical and mechanical characteristics. The drilling process of nonuniform structures plays a significant role prior to the assembly operation. However, this drilling process is typically associated with unacceptable CFRP delamination, hole accuracy, and high tool wear. These machining difficulties are attributed to high thermal load and poor chip evacuation mechanism. Low-frequency vibration-assisted drilling (LF-VAD) is an advanced manufacturing technique where the dynamic change of the uncut chip thickness is used to manipulate the cutting energy. An efficient chip evacuation mechanism was achieved through axial tool oscillation. This study investigates the effect of vibration-assisted drilling machining parameters on tool wear mechanisms. The paper also presents the effect of tool wear progression on drilled hole quality. Hole quality is described by CFRP entry and exit delamination and hole accuracy. The results showed a significant reduction in the thrust force, cutting torque, cutting temperature, and flank wear-land.},

 abstract = {In the drive towards a sustainable bio-economy, a growing interest exists in the development of composite materials using renewable natural resources. This paper explores the life cycle assessment of processing of Flax fibre reinforced polylactic acid (PLA), with a comparison of glass fibre triaxial fabric in the production process. The use of hydrocarbon fossil resources and synthetic fibres, such as glass and carbon, have caused severe environmental impacts in their entire life cycles. Whereas, Flax/PLA is one of the cornerstones for the sustainable economic growth of natural fibre composites. In this study, the manufacturing processes for the production of Flax/PLA tape and triaxial glass fibre were evaluated through a gate-to-gate life cycle assessment (LCA). The assessment was based on an input-output model to estimate energy demand and environmental impacts. The quality of the natural hybrid composite produced and cost-effectiveness of their LCA was dependent on their roving processing speeds and temperature applied to both the Flax/PLA tape and triaxial glass fabrics during processing. The optimum processing condition was found to be at a maximum of 4 m/min at a constant temperature of 170 Â°C. In contrast, the optimum for normal triaxial glass fibre production was at a slower speed of 1 m/min using a roving glass fibre laminating machine. The results showed that when the Flax and PLA were combined to produce new composite material in the form of a flax/PLA tape, energy consumption was 0.25 MJ/kg, which is lower than the 0.8 MJ/kg used for glass fibre fabric process. Flax/PLA tape and glass fibre fabric composites have a carbon footprint equivalent to 0.036 kg CO2 and 0.11 kg CO2, respectively, under the same manufacturing conditions. These are within the technical requirements in the composites industry. The manufacturing process adopted to transform Flax/PLA into a similar tape composite was considerably quicker than that of woven glass fibre fabric for composite tape. This work elucidated the relationship of the energy consumptions of the two materials processes by using a standard LCA analytical methodology. The outcomes supported an alternative option for replacement of some conventional composite materials for the automotive industry. Most importantly, the natural fibre composite production is shown to result in an economic benefit and reduced environmental impact.},

Displacements on two axes were applied to the cruciform specimens with a hole in the center. The thickness strain in the region near the hole was compared to the simulation results. Because this forming test is free of friction and bending, it is an appropriate method to assess the anisotropic yield function without the influences of friction or the Bauschinger effect, or the need to consider the stress-strain curve in high-strain region. Hill1948, YLD2000-2D, and spline yield function which is an improved version of the Vegter model were selected, and 6000 series aluminum alloy sheets (A6116-T4) were used in this study. The parameter identification method of the spline yield function also proposed in this paper using the pseudo plane strain tensile test and optimization software. As a result, the spline yield function has better predictive accuracy than the conventional anisotropic yield functions Hill1948 and YLD2000-2D.},

The present model predicts the behavior of surface roughness at multiple length scales, depending on feed, nose radius, tool edge radius, machine tool error, and material-dependent parametersâin particular, the minimum effective rake angle. Experimental tests were conducted on a commercial lathe with slightly modified conventional tooling to provide relevant results. Additionally, the model-predicted roughness was compared against pedigreed surface roughness data from previous efforts that included materials 51CrV4 and AL 1075. Previously obscure machine tool error effects have been identified and can be modeled within the proposed framework. Preliminary findings of the modelâs relevance to subsurface properties have also been presented. The proposed model has been shown to accurately predict roughness values for both long and short surface roughness evaluation lengths, which implies its utility not only as a surface roughness prediction tool, but as a basis for understanding three-dimensional surface generation in ductile-machining materials, and the properties derived therefrom.},

 abstract = {Micrographic image analysis, tomography and the Archimedes method are commonly used to analyze the porosity of Selective Laser Melting (SLM)-produced parts and then to estimate the relative density. This article deals with the limitation of the relative density results to conclude on the quality of a part manufactured by additive manufacturing and focuses on the interpretation of the relative density result. To achieve this aim, two experimental methods are used: the image analysis method, which provides local information on the distribution of porosity, and the Archimedes method, which provides access to global information. To investigate this, two different grades of aluminum alloy, AlSi7Mg0.6 and AM205, were used in this study. The study concludes that an analysis of the metallographic images to calculate the relative density of the part depends on the areas chosen for the analysis. In addition, the results show that the Archimedes method has limitations, particularly related to the choice of reference materials for calculating relative density. It can be observed, for example, that, depending on the experimental conditions, the calculation can lead to relative densities higher than 100%, which is inconsistent. This article shows that it is essential that a result of relative density obtained from Archimedes measurements be supplemented by an indication of the reference density used.},

 abstract = {High average power (>50 W) nanosecond pulsed fiber lasers are now routinely available owing to the demand for high throughput laser applications. However, in some applications, scale-up in average power has a detrimental effect on process quality due to laser-induced thermal accumulation in the workpiece. To understand the laserâmaterial interactions in this power regime, and how best to optimize process performance and quality, we investigated the influence of laser parameters such as pulse duration, energy dose (i.e., total energy deposited per unit area), and pulse repetition frequency (PRF) on engraving 316L stainless steel. Two different laser beam scanning strategies, namely, sequential method (SM) and interlacing method (IM), were examined. For each set of parameters, the material removal rate (MRR) and average surface roughness (Sa) were measured using an Alicona 3D surface profilometer. A phenomenological model has been used to help identify the best combination of laser parameters for engraving. Specifically, this study has found that (i) the model serves as a quick way to streamline parameters for area engraving (ii) increasing the pulse duration and energy dose at certain PRF results in a high MRR, albeit with an associated increase in Sa, and (iii) the IM offers 84% reduction in surface roughness at a higher MRR compared to SM. Ultimately, high quality at high throughput engraving is demonstrated using optimized process parameters.},

Recently, USIBORÂ®2000 (37MnB5) steel has been added to the family of UHSS. This new material allows higher performance with respect to its predecessor USIBORÂ®1500 (22MnB5). In this work, the two steels are compared for the manufacturing of an automotive B-Pillar by press-hardening with a tailored tool tempering approach. A Finite Element (FE) model has been developed for the numerical simulation of thermomechanical cycles of the press-hardening process. The FE-simulations have been performed with the aim of obtaining soft zones in the part, by varying the quenching time and the temperature of heated tools. The effects of these parameters on the mechanical properties of the part have been experimentally evaluated thanks to hardness and tensile tests performed on specimens subjected to the numerical thermo-mechanical cycles using the Geeble-3180 physical simulator. The results show that for both UHSS, an increase in quenching time leads to a decrease in hardness up to a threshold value, which is lower for the USIBORÂ®1500. Moreover, higher mechanical resistance and lower elongation at break values are derived for the USIBORÂ®2000 steel than for USIBORÂ®1500 steel.},

 abstract = {Accurately predicting the time-varying dynamic parameters of a workpiece during the milling of thin-walled parts is the foundation of adaptively selecting chatter-free machining parameters. Hence, a method for accurately and quickly predicting the time-varying dynamic parameters for milling thin-walled parts is proposed, which is based on the shell FEM and a three-layer neural network. The time-dependent dynamics of the workpiece can be calculated using the FEM by obtaining the geometrical parameters of the arc-faced junctions within the discrete cells of the initial and machined workpiece. It is unnecessary to re-divide the mesh cells of the thin-walled parts at each cutting position, which enhances the computational efficiency of the workpiece dynamics. Meanwhile, in comparison with the three-dimensional cube elements, the shell elements can reduce the number of degrees of freedom of the FEM model by 74%, which leads to the computation of the characteristic equation that is about nine times faster. The results of the modal test show that the maximum error of the shell FEM in predicting the natural frequency of the workpiece is about 4%. Furthermore, a three-layer neural network is constructed, and the results of the shell FEM are used as samples to train the model. The neural network model has a maximum prediction error of 0.409% when benchmarked against the results of the FEM. Furthermore, the three-layer neural network effectively enhances computational efficiency while guaranteeing accuracy.},

In addition to a high automation capability, the precise control of the energy deposition into the material plays an important role, especially when highly reflective materials, such as copper or aluminum, must be welded together. Alongside the use of highly brilliant fiber lasers in the near-infrared range with a focal diameter of a few tens of micrometers, diode lasers in the wavelength range of 445 nm are increasingly being used. Here, beam diameters of a few hundred micrometers can be achieved. With a wavelength of 445 nm, the absorptivity in copper can be increased by more than a factor of 10 compared to a near-infrared laser beam sources in solid state at room temperature. This paper presents the in situ X-ray observation of laser welding processes on CuSn6 with a laser beam source with a wavelength of 445 nm using synchrotron radiation at DESY Petra III Beamline P07 EH4 in Hamburg, Germany. For the experiments, the laser radiation was focused via two separate optics to focal diameters of 362 Âµm and 609 Âµm. To characterize the dynamics of the vapor capillaries depending on the different focal diameters dF, the parameters were varied with respect to laser power PL and feed rate v. For the investigations, a synchrotron beam of 2 Ã 2 mm2 in size with a photon energy of 89 keV was used, and the material samples were analyzed by means of phase-contrast videography to show the boundaries between solid, liquid, and gaseous material phases. The results of this paper show the welding depths achieved and how the geometry of the vapor capillary behaves by changing the focal diameter, laser power and feed rate.},

 abstract = {The use of fibers as mass reinforcement to delay cracking and to improve the strength and the post-cracking performance of reinforced concrete (RC) beams has been well documented. However, issues of common engineering practice about the beneficial effect of steel fibers to the seismic resistance of RC structural members in active earthquake zones have not yet been fully clarified. This study presents an experimental and a numerical approach to the aforementioned question. The hysteretic response of slender and deep steel fiber-reinforced concrete (SFRC) beams reinforced with steel reinforcement is investigated through tests of eleven beams subjected to reversal cyclic loading and numerical analysis using 3D finite element (FE) modeling. The experimental program includes flexural and shear-critical SFRC beams with different ratios of steel reinforcing bars (0.55% and 1.0%), closed stirrups (from 0 to 0.5%), and fibers with content from 0.5 to 3% per volume. The developed nonlinear FE numerical simulation considers well-established relationships for the compression and tensional behavior of SFRC that are based on test results. Specifically, a smeared crack model is proposed for the post-cracking behavior of SFRC under tension, which employs the fracture characteristics of the composite material using stress versus crack width curves with tension softening. Axial tension tests of prismatic SFRC specimens are also included in this study to support the experimental project and to verify the proposed model. Comparing the numerical results with the experimental ones it is revealed that the proposed model is efficient and accurately captures the crucial aspects of the response, such as the SFRC tension softening effect, the load versus deformation cyclic envelope and the influence of the fibers on the overall hysteretic performance. The findings of this study also reveal that SFRC beams showed enhanced cyclic behavior in terms of residual stiffness, load-bearing capacity, deformation, energy dissipation ability and cracking performance, maintaining their integrity through the imposed reversal cyclic tests.},

 abstract = {A new meta-surface structure (MSS) with a near-zero refractive index (NZRI) is proposed to enhance the performance of a square loop antenna array. The main challenge to improve the antenna performance is increment of the overall antenna volume that is mitigated by assimilating the planar NZRI MSS at the back of the antenna structure. The proposed NZRI MSS-loaded CPW-fed (Co-Planar Waveguide) four-element array antenna is designed on ceramic-bioplastic-ceramic sandwich substrate using high-frequency structure simulator (HFSS), a finite-element-method-based simulation tool. The gain and directivity of the antenna are significantly enhanced by incorporating the NZRI MSS with a 7 Ã 6 set of elements at the back of the antenna structure. Measurement results show that the maximum gains of the antenna increased from 6.21 dBi to 8.25 dBi, from 6.52 dBi to 9.05 dBi and from 10.54 dBi to 12.15 dBi in the first, second and third bands, respectively. The effect of the slot configuration in the ground plane on the reflection coefficient of the antenna was analyzed and optimized. The overall performance makes the proposed antenna appropriate for UHFFM (Ultra High Frequency Frequency Modulation) telemetry-based space applications as well as mobile satellite, microwave radiometry and radio astronomy applications.},

@article{ma9100848,
 abstract = {In this study, we devised a novel nanofibrous adsorbent made of polyethersulfone (PES) for removal of methylene blue (MB) dye pollutant from water. The polymer shows a low isoelectric point thus at elevated pHs and, being nanofibrous, can offer a huge highly hydroxylated surface area for adsorption of cationic MB molecules. As an extra challenge, to augment the adsorbentâs properties in terms of adsorption capacity in neutral and acidic conditions and thermal stability, vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) nanoparticles were added to the nanofibers. Adsorption data were analyzed according to the Freundlich adsorption model. The thermodynamic parameters verified that only at basic pH is the adsorption spontaneous and in general the process is entropy-driven and endothermic. The kinetics of the adsorption process was evaluated by the pseudo-first- and pseudo-second-order models. The latter model exhibited the highest correlation with data. In sum, the adsorbent showed a promising potential for dye removal from industrial dyeing wastewater systems, especially when envisaging their alkaline and hot conditions.},
