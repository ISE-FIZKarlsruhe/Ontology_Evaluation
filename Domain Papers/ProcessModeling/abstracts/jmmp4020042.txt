This work presents a comprehensive structure for evaluating the sustainability of machining processes. Industries can contribute towards developing a sustainable future by using algorithms that evaluate the sustainability of their processes. Inspired by the literature, the proposed model involves a set of metrics that are critical in evaluating the impact of a process on society, environment, and economy. The flexibility of this model allows decision-makers to use the available responses to identify the most favorable process. The entropy weight method was suggested for objectively calculating the weights of each indicator. A multi-criteria decision-making method i.e., Technique for Order Preference based on Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), was used to rank processes in the decreasing order of their sustainability. The proposed algorithm was successfully validated with case studies from the published literature. A MATLAB code was also created so that industries may expeditiously apply this method to evaluate the sustainability of machining processes.
