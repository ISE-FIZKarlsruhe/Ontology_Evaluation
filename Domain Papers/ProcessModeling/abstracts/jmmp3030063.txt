The use of lightweight material such as CFRP/Ti6Al4V in stacked structures in the aerospace industry is associated with improved physical and mechanical characteristics. The drilling process of nonuniform structures plays a significant role prior to the assembly operation. However, this drilling process is typically associated with unacceptable CFRP delamination, hole accuracy, and high tool wear. These machining difficulties are attributed to high thermal load and poor chip evacuation mechanism. Low-frequency vibration-assisted drilling (LF-VAD) is an advanced manufacturing technique where the dynamic change of the uncut chip thickness is used to manipulate the cutting energy. An efficient chip evacuation mechanism was achieved through axial tool oscillation. This study investigates the effect of vibration-assisted drilling machining parameters on tool wear mechanisms. The paper also presents the effect of tool wear progression on drilled hole quality. Hole quality is described by CFRP entry and exit delamination and hole accuracy. The results showed a significant reduction in the thrust force, cutting torque, cutting temperature, and flank wear-land.
