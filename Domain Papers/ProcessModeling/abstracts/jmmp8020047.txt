Laser beam welding as a reliable tool for high-precision joining of batteries or microelectronics is more and more the choice for achieving reproducible results in production processes. In addition to a high automation capability, the precise control of the energy deposition into the material plays an important role, especially when highly reflective materials, such as copper or aluminum, must be welded together. Alongside the use of highly brilliant fiber lasers in the near-infrared range with a focal diameter of a few tens of micrometers, diode lasers in the wavelength range of 445 nm are increasingly being used. Here, beam diameters of a few hundred micrometers can be achieved. With a wavelength of 445 nm, the absorptivity in copper can be increased by more than a factor of 10 compared to a near-infrared laser beam sources in solid state at room temperature. This paper presents the in situ X-ray observation of laser welding processes on CuSn6 with a laser beam source with a wavelength of 445 nm using synchrotron radiation at DESY Petra III Beamline P07 EH4 in Hamburg, Germany. For the experiments, the laser radiation was focused via two separate optics to focal diameters of 362 µm and 609 µm. To characterize the dynamics of the vapor capillaries depending on the different focal diameters dF, the parameters were varied with respect to laser power PL and feed rate v. For the investigations, a synchrotron beam of 2 × 2 mm2 in size with a photon energy of 89 keV was used, and the material samples were analyzed by means of phase-contrast videography to show the boundaries between solid, liquid, and gaseous material phases. The results of this paper show the welding depths achieved and how the geometry of the vapor capillary behaves by changing the focal diameter, laser power and feed rate.
