To evaluate the prediction accuracy of the anisotropic yield function, we propose an original cruciform hole expansion test. Displacements on two axes were applied to the cruciform specimens with a hole in the center. The thickness strain in the region near the hole was compared to the simulation results. Because this forming test is free of friction and bending, it is an appropriate method to assess the anisotropic yield function without the influences of friction or the Bauschinger effect, or the need to consider the stress-strain curve in high-strain region. Hill1948, YLD2000-2D, and spline yield function which is an improved version of the Vegter model were selected, and 6000 series aluminum alloy sheets (A6116-T4) were used in this study. The parameter identification method of the spline yield function also proposed in this paper using the pseudo plane strain tensile test and optimization software. As a result, the spline yield function has better predictive accuracy than the conventional anisotropic yield functions Hill1948 and YLD2000-2D.
