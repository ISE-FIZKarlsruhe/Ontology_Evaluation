ABSTRACT = {The complexity of milling metal matrix composite alloys based on aluminum like Al/SiC is due to their low melting point and high abrasive ability, which causes increased wear of carbide tools. One of the effective ways to improve its reliability and service life is to modify the surface by plasma chemical deposition of carbon-based multilayer functional layers from vapor (CVD) with high hardness and thermal conductivity: diamond-like (DLC) or polycrystalline diamond (PCD) coatings. Experiments on an indexable mill with CoroMill 200 inserts have shown that initial tool life increases up to 100% for cases with DLC and up to 300% for multilayered MCD/NCD films at a cutting speed of 800 m/min. The primary mechanism of wear of a carbide tool in this cutting mode was soft abrasion, when wear on both the rake and flank surfaces occurred due to the extrusion of cobalt binder between tungsten carbide grains, followed by their loss. Analysis of the wear pattern of plates with DLC and MCD/NCD coatings showed that abrasive wear begins to prevail against the background of soft abrasion. Adhesive wear is also present to a lesser extent, but there is no chipping of the base material from the cutting edge.},

ABSTRACT = {The most effective and cutting-edge method for achieving a 0.004 mm precision on a typical material is to employ die-sinking electrical discharge machining (EDM). The material removal rate (MRR), tool wear rate (TWR), residual stresses, and crater depth were analyzed in the current study in an effort to increase the productivity and comprehension of the die-sinking EDM process. A parametric design was employed to construct a two-dimensional model, and the accuracy of the findings was verified by comparing them to prior research. Experiments were conducted utilizing the EDM machine, and the outcomes were assessed in relation to numerical simulations of the MRR and TWR. A significant temperature disparity that arises among different sections of the workpiece may result in the formation of residual strains throughout. As a consequence, a structural model was developed in order to examine the impacts of various stress responses. The primary innovations of this paper are its parametric investigation of residual stresses and its use of Haynes 25, a workpiece material that has received limited attention despite its numerous benefits and variety of applications. In order to accurately forecast the output parameters, a deep neural network model, more precisely, a multilayer perceptron (MLP) regressor, was utilized. In order to improve the precision of the outcomes and guarantee stability during convergence, the L-BFGS solver, an adaptive learning rate, and the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function were integrated. Extensive parametric studies allowed us to determine the connection between key inputs, including the discharge current, voltage, and spark-on time, and the output parameters, namely, the MRR, TWR, and crater depth.},

ABSTRACT = {Ti6Al4V alloy (Ti64) is a popular material used in the aerospace, medical, and automotive industries due to its excellent mechanical properties. Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) is a promising manufacturing technique that can produce complex and net-shaped components with comparable mechanical properties to those produced using conventional manufacturing techniques. However, during LPBF, the rapid cooling of the material can limit its ductility, making it difficult to achieve high levels of ductility while maintaining the required tensile strength for critical applications. To address this challenge, this study presents a novel approach to controlling the microstructure of Ti64 during LPBF by using a border design surrounding the main parts. It is hypothesized that the design induces in situ martensitic decomposition at different levels during the fabrication process, which can enhance the ductility of the material without compromising its tensile strength. To achieve this aim, a series of Ti64 samples were fabricated using LPBF with varying border designs, including those without borders and with gaps from 0.5 to 4 mm. The microstructure, composition, and mechanical properties of the Reference sample were compared with those of the samples fabricated with the surrounding border design. It was found that the latter had a more homogenized microstructure, a higher density, and improvements in both ductility and tensile strength. Moreover, it was discovered that the level of property improvement and martensitic transformation can be controlled by adjusting the gap space between the border and the main part, providing flexibility in the fabrication process. Overall, this study presents a promising approach for enhancing the mechanical properties of Ti64 produced via LPBF, making it more suitable for critical applications in various industries.},

ABSTRACT = {Arc additive manufacturing (AAM) has the advantages of fast deposition speed and good surfacing quality. It is a promising additive manufacturing (AM) method. However, arc additive manufacturing is difficult to use widely in industry due to its poor deformation, microstructure, and mechanical properties. Since the mechanical properties of materials can be greatly improved by rolling, a method for configuration synthesis of the side-rolling mechanism by using metamorphic mechanism theory is presented in this paper. Firstly, by analyzing the operational demands of the side-rolling mechanism, we obtained the motion cycle diagram for the metamorphic mechanism in addition to the corresponding equivalent resistance gradient matrix. Secondly, according to the motion cycle diagram and equivalent resistance gradient matrix of the metamorphic mechanism, the structure and constraint form of the metamorphic joints were established, and the relationship between the force variation and the structure and the constraint form of the metamorphic joints was also obtained. Then, the structures of all 12 corresponding constrained metamorphic mechanisms were synthesized. Ultimately, one among the twelve mechanisms was chosen as the side-rolling metamorphic mechanism. The topological transformation of its working configuration was examined. The results confirmed the feasibility and practicality of the proposed structural synthesis method in this study.},

ABSTRACT = {We report a study on the process of the formation of bubble-like structures on a coated glass surface using 50 ps laser pulses. The high-intensity interaction of laser radiation on the film–glass interface allowed us to develop a process for efficient glass bump formation. The high peak energy of the picosecond pulses has allowed us to merge the processes of coating evaporation and bubble growth into one. A parameter window was established within which efficient bump formation can be achieved. Well-defined spherical structures with a height up to 60 μm and a diameter up to 250 μm were obtained at pulse energy Epulse = 2.5 ÷ 4 μJ and laser fluence F = 2.5–0.41 J/cm2). The key aspects of the bump formation process were studied and are explained.},

ABSTRACT = {Biomass–fungi biocomposite materials are derived from sustainable sources and can biodegrade at the end of their service. They can be used to manufacture products that are traditionally made from petroleum-based plastics. There are potential applications for these products in the packaging, furniture, and construction industries. In the biomass–fungi biocomposite materials, the biomass particles (made from agricultural waste such as hemp hurd) act as the substrate, and a network of fungal hyphae grow through and bind the biomass particles together. Typically, molding-based methods are used to manufacture products using these biocomposite materials. Recently, the authors reported a novel extrusion-based 3D printing method using these biocomposite materials. This paper reports a follow-up investigation into the effects of mixing parameters (mixing time and mixing mode) on fungal growth in biomass–fungi mixtures prepared for 3D printing and the effects of printing parameters (printing speed and extrusion pressure) on fungal growth in printed samples. The fungal growth was quantified using the number of fungal colonies that grew from samples. The results show that, when mixing time increased from 15 to 120 s, there was a 52% increase in fungal growth. Changing from continuous to intermittent mixing mode resulted in an 11% increase in fungal growth. Compared to mixtures that were not subjected to printing, samples printed with a high printing speed and high extrusion pressure had a 14.6% reduction in fungal growth, while those with a low printing speed and low extrusion pressure resulted in a 16.5% reduction in fungal growth.},

ABSTRACT = {Incremental sheet forming (ISF) is an advanced flexible manufacturing process to produce complex 3D products. Unlike the conventional stamping process, ISF does not require any high cost dedicated dies. However, numerical computation for large-size ISF processes is time-consuming, and its accuracy for spring back due to unclamping tools after ISF cannot satisfy industrial demand. In this paper, an advanced numerical model considering complicated forming tool paths, trimming, and spring back was developed to efficiently simulate the multi-stage deformation phenomena of incremental sheet forming processes. Numerical modeling accuracy and efficiency are investigated considering the influence of tool path, material properties of the blank, mesh size, and boundary conditions. Through a series of case studies and comparisons with experimental results, it is observed that the numerical model with kinematics material properties and a moderate element size (5 mm) may reproduce the deformation characteristics of ISF with good accuracy and can obtain practical efficiency for a large-size ISF part.},

ABSTRACT = {Wire and arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) is a metal deposition technique with a fast rate and the possibility of a high volume of deposition. Because of its fast deposition and high heat input, the manufactured products have poor surface quality. This paper presents a study on the machining of Inconel 718 wall-shaped additive manufacturing (AM) products, a necessary step for the improvement of surface quality. Considering the possibility that the characteristics of the milling processes of AM products might differ from those of traditionally manufactured parts, in this research, two types of Inconel 718 were studied and compared: one was manufactured using WAAM, and the other was an Inconel 718 rolled bar (Aerospace Material Specifications 5662). Using the testing procedure, a conventional two-flute cutting tool was used to assess their machinability. For this process, multiple passes were performed at three different heights of the samples. Considering the peculiarities of the AM products, such as their uneven surfaces, dendritic microstructures, and anisotropy, the results were analyzed. After the machining operation, the effects on the products were also studied by analyzing their surface quality. This study found a higher stability in the cutting process for the AMS 5662 samples relative to the WAAM parts with less variability in the cutting forces overall, resulting in better surface quality.},

ABSTRACT = {Tailoring the properties of hot-stamped components offers the potential to enhance crash performance while simultaneously improving downstream joining processes. In recent years, an innovative technology suited for achieving tailored properties involving the utilization of a specialized furnace chamber, known as the TemperBox®, has been introduced. Within this chamber, a cooled aluminum mask shields specific areas of the blank from incoming heat radiation and concurrently absorbs the blank’s own radiation. The duration of the heat radiation exchange can influence the diffusion-dependent phase transformation and, consequently, the resulting mechanical properties. Hence, the intermediate cooling duration assumes a pivotal role as a parameter, as is investigated in this study. To examine the effects, specimens of the steel 22MnB5 AS150 are subjected to intermediate cooling of varying durations, followed by forming and partial quenching. The temperature profile of the blank during intermediate cooling prior to forming and quenching is analyzed. Subsequently, the tailored hot-stamped components are assessed for hardness, strength, ductility, and thickness strain. The study reveals that with increasing duration of partial intermediate cooling and targeted radiation exchange, a homogeneous ferritic–pearlitic structure is formed from an austenitic structure. This uniform structure of ferrite and pearlite is reflected in lower hardness and strength values, along with improved ductility. Additionally, this paper introduces a simulation methodology designed to calculate the dynamics of thermal radiation and the kinetics of phase transformation.},

ABSTRACT = {Ferritic stainless steel (FSS) is widely used to manufacture deep-drawn products for corrosion resistance applications, being the alloy drawability strongly affected by its microstructural anisotropy. This study combines a variety of microscopy techniques enabling in-depth analyses of the microstructural evolution of two different FSSs correlated to their deep drawing performance. One of the steels has a good correspondence with the standard EN-1.4016 (AISI 430). The other is a modified version of the previous one with higher contents of the ferrite-stabilising elements Si and Cr, and lower contents of the austenite-stabilising elements C, N, and Mn. Electron Backscatter Diffraction results confirm that the microstructural properties and drawability of FSS in the deep drawing process are improved in the modified steel version. Scanning transmission electron microscopy under low-angle annular dark field conditions evidences that the deformation mechanism of FSS during deep drawing follows a microstructural distortion model based on the grain size gradient and shows a variation of the deformation texture depending on the alloy composition. This work demonstrates the potential of advanced microscopy techniques for optimising the processing and design of ferritic stainless steels, with slight variations in the alloy composition, for deep drawing applications.},

ABSTRACT = {Low performance is considered one of the main drawbacks of laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) technology. In the present work, the effect of the AlSi10Mg powder layer thickness on the laser melting process was investigated to improve the LPBF building rate. A high-fidelity simulation of the melt pool formation was performed for different thicknesses of the powder bed using the Kintech Simulation Software for Additive Manufacturing (KiSSAM, version cd8e01d) developed by the authors. The powder bed after the recoating operation was obtained by the discrete element method. The laser energy deposition on the powder particles and the substrate was simulated by ray tracing. For the validation of the model, an experimental analysis of single tracks was performed on two types of substrates. The first substrate was manufactured directly with LPBF technology, while the second was cast. The simulation was carried out for various combinations of process parameters, predominantly with a high energy input, which provided a sufficient remelting depth. The calculations revealed the unstable keyhole mode appearance associated with the low absorptivity of the aluminum alloy at a scanning speed of 300 mm/s for all levels of the laser power (325–375 W). The results allowed formulating the criteria for the lack of fusion emerging during LPBF with an increased layer thickness. This work is expected to provide a scientific basis for the analysis of the maximum layer thickness via simulation to increase the performance of the technology.},

ABSTRACT = {Multi-Material Jetting (MMJ) is an additive manufacturing process empowering the printing of ceramics and hard metals with the highest precision. Given great advantages, it also poses challenges in ensuring the repeatability of part quality due to an inherent broader choice of built strategies. The addition of advanced quality assurance methods can therefore benefit the repeatability of part quality for widespread adoption. In particular, quality defects caused by improperly configured droplet overlap parameterizations, despite droplets themselves being well parameterized, constitute a major challenge for stable process control. This publication deals with the automated classification of the adequacy of process parameterization on green parts based on in-line surface measurements and their processing with machine learning methods, in particular the training of convolutional neural networks. To generate the training data, a demo part structure with eight layers was printed with different overlap settings, scanned, and labeled by process engineers. In particular, models with two convolutional layers and a pooling size of (6, 6) appeared to yield the best accuracies. Models trained only with images of the first layer and without the infill edge obtained validation accuracies of 90%. Consequently, an arbitrary section of the first layer is sufficient to deliver a prediction about the quality of the subsequently printed layers.},

ABSTRACT = {Manufacturing structural monolithic components for the aerospace market often involves machining distortion, which entails high costs and material and energy waste in industry. Despite the development of distortion calculation and avoidance tools, this issue remains unsolved due to the difficulties in accurately and economically measuring the residual stresses of the machining blanks. In the last years, the on-machine layer removal method has shown its potential for industrial implementation, offering the possibility to obtain final components from blanks with measured residual stresses. However, this measuring method requires too long an implementation time to be used in-process as part of the manufacturing chains. In this sense, the objective of this paper is to provide a machining distortion prediction method based on bulk residual stress estimation and hybrid modelling. The bulk residual stresses estimation is performed using reduced layer removal measurements. Considering bulk residual stress data and machining-induced residual stress data, as well as geometry and material data, real-part distortion calculations can be performed. For this, a hybrid model based on the combination of an analytical formulation and finite element modelling is employed, which enables us to perform fast and accurate calculations. With the developments here presented, the machining distortion can be predicted, and its uncertainty range can be calculated, in a simple and fast way. The accuracy and practicality of these developments are evaluated by comparison with the experimental results, showing the capability of the proposed solution in providing distortion predictions with errors lower than 10% in comparison with the experimental results.},

Because surface mechanical properties reflect material performance directly in terms of durability and frictional behavior, understanding and modeling them is important for industry and research. This emphasizes the surface mechanical properties of Vickers hardness and the static friction coefficient, with attempts to model them as functions of stress at yield initiation. Vickers hardness can be related to the compressive stress at yield initiation. The static friction coefficient can be modeled as a function of the surface shear strength and Vickers hardness. This research has improved our understanding of thermoplastics’ surface mechanical properties and has enabled the prediction of the scratch performance of molded products and the provision of effective indicators for material design.},

ABSTRACT = {The automation of the manufacturing processes of thermoplastic composite laminates has become dependent on open mold processes such as automated tape placement (ATP), which couples tape layering with in situ consolidation. The manufacturing parameters of ATP open mold processes, which comprise processing time, consolidation pressure and temperature, affect the bond strength between the plies and the quality of the laminates produced. Therefore, the effect of the manufacturing parameters should be characterized. This work experimentally evaluates the feasibility of fabricating thermoplastic laminates using an open mold process that reasonably models that of ATP. Glass fiber-reinforced polypropylene laminates are fabricated from unidirectional tapes under different consolidation periods, pressures, and temperatures. The bond quality in the produced laminates is assessed by measuring their interlaminar shear strength, which is measured using a short beam standardized shear test in conjunction with digital image correlation. Results show that consolidation can occur at temperatures slightly below the composite tapes’ complete melting temperature, and consolidation times between 7 and 13 min can result in acceptable bond strengths. The results confirmed the feasibility of the process and highlighted its limitations. Analysis of variance and machine learning showed that the effect of process parameters on interlaminar shear strength is nonlinear.},

ABSTRACT = {The modeling of machining process characteristics and, in particular, of various cutting processes occupies a significant part of modern research. Determining the thermal characteristics in short hole drilling processes by numerical simulation is the object of the present study. For different contact conditions of the workpiece with the drill cutting inserts, the thermal properties of the machined material were determined. The above-mentioned properties and parameters of the model components were established using a three-dimensional finite element model of orthogonal cutting. Determination of the generalized values of the machined material thermal properties was performed by finding the set intersection of individual properties values using a previously developed software algorithm. A comparison of experimental and simulated values of cutting temperature in the workpiece points located at different distances from the drilled hole surface and on the lateral clearance face of the drill outer cutting insert shows the validity of the developed numerical model for drilling short holes. The difference between simulated and measured temperature values did not exceed 22.4% in the whole range of the studied cutting modes.},

For this purpose, an ML application for the detection of changeover times on milling machines is implemented and analyzed in the brownfield and greenfield scenarios as well as a combined scenario. Particular attention is paid to the selection of sensors and features. It was found that the abundant availability of features in the greenfield scenario poses pitfalls when creating ML projects if the underlying sensors cannot be checked for their suitability. For the changeover detector use case, the best model quality was achieved for the combined scenario, followed by the greenfield scenario.},

ABSTRACT = {Triply periodic minimal surface (TPMS) structures offer lightweight and high-stiffness solutions to different industrial applications. However, testing of these structures to calculate their mechanical properties is expensive. Therefore, it is important to predict the mechanical properties of these structures effectively.

Gyroid, diamond, and primitive specimens with three different volume fractions (0.2, 0.3, and 0.4) were manufactured using a laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) additive manufacturing process using three different build orientations (45°, 60°, and 90°) in the present study. Experimental and statistical results revealed that regression analysis and related equations can be used to predict the mass, yield stress, elastic modulus, specific energy absorption, and onset of densification values of TPMS structures with an intermediate volume fraction value and specified build orientation with an error range less than 1.4%, 7.1%, 19.04%, 21.6%, and 13.4%, respectively.},

ABSTRACT = {Hot-dip galvanized components offer a great potential for corrosion protection of up to 100 years, while laser beam welding in vacuum (LaVa) has the advantage of high penetration depths Combined, this process chain can be economically used in steel construction of bridges, wind turbines, or other steel constructions. Therefore, investigations of butt joint welding of galvanized 20 mm thick S355M steel plates using LaVa were carried out. The butt joints were prepared under different cutting edges such as flame-cut, sawn, and milled edges, and they were studied with and without the zinc layer in the joint gap. For this purpose, the laser parameters such as the beam power, welding speed, focus position, and working pressure all varied, as did the oscillation parameters. The welds performed using an infinity oscillation with an amplitude of 5 mm represented a pore-free weld up to a zinc layer thickness of 400 µm in the joint gap. The seam undercut increased with increasing the zinc layer thickness in the joint gap, which can be explained by the evaporating zinc and consequently the missing material, since no filler material was used. The joint welds with zinc only on the sheet surface achieved a sufficient weld quality without pores.},

ABSTRACT = {This study is focused on examining the feasibility of applying laser hardening to a commercial metallic bike rim, employing a CW IR fibre laser. The research comprises two main phases. The first phase involves an assessment of the impact of laser parameters on the metallic microstructure, while the second phase involves the actual laser hardening of the bike rim. A comprehensive evaluation encompassing hardness measurements, optical microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy was conducted on the samples. The microstructure type can be manipulated by skilfully adjusting the laser parameters, allowing for the creation of various microstructure variants within the laser-hardened zone for specific laser conditions. In this regard, multiple microstructure types were observed. The hardness of the laser-processed zones exhibited variations corresponding to the specific microstructure. Notably, the molten zone (MZ) and the second heat-affected zone (HAZ II) exhibited the highest levels of hardness. Furthermore, it was observed that a scan overlap of ≥ 75% led to an augmentation in hardness. This study sheds light on the intricate interplay between laser parameters, microstructure, and resultant hardness in the context of laser hardening of metallic materials.},

ABSTRACT = {The metal spinning process has been observed in recent major investigations carried out using finite element analysis. One interesting idea has proposed simulating a rotating disc for the simulation of the metal spinning process to reduce computational time. The development of this concept is presented in this paper, including the formal mathematical transformation from the inertial frame to the rotating reference frame, specific FEM configurations with mesh sizes based on a minimized aspect ratio, a mesh convergence study, and the application of a feed rate scale. Furthermore, in the context of the rotating reference frame, the flange geometry after wrinkle initiation is investigated, including the number of peaks and their amplitudes. Using this new approach, it was found that the number of peaks gradually increases from two to eight peaks while their amplitude decreases. In the case of severe wrinkles, the number of peaks stays at four while the amplitude increases dramatically. The intermediate path proves capable of increasing the number of peaks while maintaining a low amplitude. These results will make it possible to design new paths, facilitating the production of defect-free spun parts.},

ABSTRACT = {The CMT (cold metal transfer) arc welding process is a valuable joining method for assembling thin sheets, minimizing heat transfers, and reducing subsequent deformations. The study aims to simulate the CMT welding of thin stainless-steel sheets to predict temperature fields and deformations. Both instrumented tests and numerical simulations were conducted for butt-welding of sheets with a thickness of 1 to 1.2 mm. Weld seam samples were observed to identify equivalent heat sources for each configuration. The electric current and voltage were monitored. Temperature measurements were performed using K-type thermocouples, as well as displacement measurements via the DIC (digital image correlation) technique. Thermomechanical simulations, considering phase changes and the actual seam geometry induced by filler material, were conducted using an equivalent heat source approach. A unique heat exchange coefficient accounting for thermal losses was identified. By incorporating these losses into thermal calculations, a good agreement was found between measured and calculated temperatures. Mechanical calculations allowed for the recovery of the horse saddle form after actual welding, with a relative difference of less than 10% in angular distortion between calculated and measured values.},

ABSTRACT = {Optical measurements are increasingly widely used as preferential techniques to evaluate dimensional and surface quantities in micro-products. However, uncertainty estimation is more critical on micro-products than macro, and it needs careful attention for evaluating the obtained quality, the requested tolerance, and the correct setting of experimental process settings. In this study, optical measurements characterized micro-injected products by linear and surface acquisition and considered all the sources contributing to uncertainties. The results show that the measure uncertainty could be underestimated if only the standard deviation on simple measurements is considered; this could cause a significant restriction of the estimated range covering the measured values. Furthermore, the findings confirm that the correct evaluation of the potential uncertainties contributes to accurately assessing the process behavior and improving product quality.},

ABSTRACT = {To produce additively manufactured components, various process advantages can be combined by using the tungsten inert gas (TIG) hot wire process with ohmic wire preheating. Unlike other various gas metal arc welding processes, with TIG, it is possible to influence the material properties by decoupling the energy supply and the welding filler material. Compared to the conventional TIG cold wire process, the hot wire process can achieve an increased deposition rate. To be able to use this combined process for the manufacturing of filigree components consisting of steel and titanium alloys, a system concept with a hermetically sealed welding chamber was developed. This concept is particularly designed for an individual use and is also intended to be used for producing prototypes and small quantities. In the investigations, the application of the TIG hot wire process is explored, regarding the material properties to be achieved in combination with the manufacturing plant concept developed with a sealed welding chamber. In this context, the mechanical-technological properties and detailed microstructural analyses are determined based on selected welding tests to evaluate and further develop the quality of the components produced. A final transfer of the findings to the process behavior by optimizing the interaction of the process parameters considered should lead to an increase in productivity, robustness, and reproducibility. The experimental setup’s potential for applicability in the field of additive manufacturing will be demonstrated based on this elaboration.},

ABSTRACT = {Fused granular fabrication (FGF) is a large format additive manufacturing (LFAM) technology and focuses on cost-effective granulate-based manufacturing by eliminating the need for semifinished filaments. This allows a faster production time and a broader range of usable materials for tailored composites. In this study, the mechanical and morphological properties of FGF test structures made of polyamid 6 reinforced with 40% of short carbon fibers were investigated. For this purpose, FGF test structures with three different parameter settings were produced. The FGF printed structures show generally significant anisotropic mechanical characteristics, caused by the layer-by-layer building process. To enhance the mechanical properties and reduce the anisotropic behavior of FGF structures, continuous unidirectional fiber-reinforced tapes (UD tapes), employing automated tape laying (ATL), were subsequently applied. Thus, a significant improvement in the flexural stiffness and strength of the manufactured FGF structures was observed by hybridization with 60% glass fiber-reinforced polyamide 6 UD tapes. Since the effectiveness of UD-tape reinforcement depends mainly on the quality of the bond between the UD tape and the FGF structure, the surface quality of the FGF structure, the interface morphology, and the tape-laying process parameters were investigated.},

ABSTRACT = {This research paper focuses on the fabrication of a microstructure based on a natural structure pattern of hydrophobic properties using micro-milling technology, followed by an investigation of the dimensional accuracy, roughness, and replication of the fabricated microstructure. Design, modeling (CAD system), fabrication, and replication are the steps of this process. Knowledge of biomimetics was used to select the microstructure. The main research aim of the experiments is to verify and extend the applicability of conventional CNC manufacturing technologies to obtain a functional surface structure. The micro-milling was carried out on a conventional DMG MORI CNC machine, a CMX 600 V three-axis horizontal milling center, using an external high-frequency electric spindle clamped to the machine. The machined material was aluminum alloy EN AW 7075. The tool was a 0.1 mm diameter double-edged ball mill made of sintered carbide and coated with TiSiN. The cutting conditions were determined according to the tool manufacturer’s recommendations. To compare the achieved accuracies, the same microstructure was fabricated using PLA technology. For subsequent replication of the sample, the negative of the selected microstructure was created and machined. Subsequently, a positive microstructure was created using the silicone impression material by the replication process. This paper and the experiments performed extend the technical knowledge in the field of manufacturing surface functional structures and confirm the possibility of manufacturing the designed structures using chip and laser machining technology, with achieved discontinuities in the range of 3 to 50 μm. They also highlight the issues of replication of such structures with respect to critical manufacturing locations (geometrical parameters of the structures affecting the functional properties of the structure, venting, replica defects, etc.).},

ABSTRACT = {In incremental sheet forming (ISF), the geometrical accuracy is still a challenge that is only solved for specific applications. The underlying mechanisms of geometrical defects in ISF are very complex and still not fully understood. Nevertheless, the process understanding is constantly evolving. Recent work has shown, for example, how bending moments resulting from residual stresses affect geometric accuracy. It has become clear that resulting bending moments with an axis parallel to the main tool path direction are dominant. Based on that, the current paper investigates the hypothesis that linear and parallel tool paths lead to an unfavourable accumulation of residual bending moments along a common axis, and whether this accumulation effect can be reduced by wave-shaped tool paths. Thus, the described research investigates the influence of novel path strategies on the residual bending moments and the resulting geometrical deviations. The path strategies are based on wave-shaped path lines, whereas the curvature is within the sheet plane. The investigations focussed on a rectangular sheet that is clamped at its shortest edges and a part geometry-sensitive to springback. Experimental and numerical investigations show a significantly positive influence of some investigated path strategies on the geometric deviation, compared to a conventional path strategy.},

ABSTRACT = {This article proposes the integration of two novel aspects into the production of 3D-printed customized wrist-hand orthoses. One aspect involves the material, particularly Colorfabb varioShore thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) filament with an active foaming agent, which allows adjusting the 3D-printed orthoses’ mechanical properties via process parameters such as printing temperature. Consequently, within the same printing process, by using a single extrusion nozzle, orthoses with varying stiffness levels can be produced, aiming at both immobilization rigidity and skin-comfortable softness. This capability is harnessed by 3D-printing the orthosis in a flat shape via material extrusion-based additive manufacturing, which represents the other novel aspect. Subsequently, the orthosis conforms to the user’s upper limb shape after secure attachment, or by thermoforming in the case of a bi-material solution. A dedicated design web app, which relies on key patient hand measurement input, is also proposed, differing from the 3D scanning and modeling approach that requires engineering expertise and 3D scan data processing. The evaluation of varioShore TPU orthoses with diverse designs was conducted considering printing time, cost, maximum flexion angle, comfort, and perceived wrist stability as criteria. As some of the produced TPU orthoses lacked the necessary stiffness around the wrist or did not properly fit the palm shape, bi-material orthoses including polylactic acid (PLA) inserts of varying sizes were 3D-printed and assessed, showing an improved stiffness around the wrist and a better hand shape conformity. The findings demonstrated the potential of this innovative approach in creating bi-material upper limb orthoses, capitalizing on various characteristics such as varioShore properties, PLA thermoforming capabilities, and the design flexibility provided by additive manufacturing technology.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper presents a method for applying forging to high-density wood. A cylindrical container was formed using a closed die, and the appropriate conditions for temperature and punch length were evaluated. Ulin, which is a high-density wood, and Japanese cedar, which is a low-density wood and widely used in Japan, were used as test materials. The pressing directions were longitudinal and radial based on wood fiber orientation, and the shape and density of the resulting containers were evaluated. In the case of ulin, cracks decreased by increasing the temperature, while temperature had little effect on Japanese cedar. Containers without cracks were successfully formed by using a punch of appropriate length. The density of the containers was uniform in the punch length l = 20 and 40 mm in the L-directional pressing and l = 20 mm in the R-directional pressing when using ulin, with an average density of 1.34 g/cm3. This result indicates the forging ability of ulin is high compared to that of commonly used low-density woods. In summary, this paper investigated the appropriate parameters for forging with ulin. As a result, products of more uniform density than products made by cutting were obtained.},

ABSTRACT = {This work presents a heat transfer and boiling model that computes the evolution of the temperature field in a representative steel workpiece quenched from 850 or 930 °C by immersion in water flowing at average velocities of 0.2 or 0.6 m/s, respectively. Under these conditions, all three boiling regimes were present during cooling: stable vapor film, nucleate boiling, and single-phase convection. The model was based on the numerical solution of the heat conduction equation coupled to the solution of the energy and momentum equations for water. The mixture phase approach was adopted using the Lee model to compute the rates of water evaporation–condensation. Heat flux at the wall was calculated for all regimes using a single semi-mechanistic model. Therefore, the evolution of boiling regimes at every position on the wall surface was automatically determined. Predictions were validated using laboratory results, namely: (a) videorecording the upward motion of the wetting front along the workpiece wall surface; and (b) cooling curves obtained with embedded thermocouples in the steel probe. Wall heat flux calculations were used to determine the importance of the simultaneous presence of all three boiling regimes on the heat flux distribution. It was found that this simultaneous presence leads to high heat flux variations that should be avoided in production lines. In addition, it was determined that the corresponding inverse heat conduction problem to estimate the active heat transfer boundary condition must be set-up for 2D heat flow.},

ABSTRACT = {Aluminium matrix composites (AMCs) represent an important group of high-performance materials. Due to their specific strength and a high thermal conductivity, these composites have been considered for the large-scale production of brake discs. However, preconditioning the friction surfaces is necessary to avoid severe wear of both the brake discs and the brake linings. This can be achieved through controlled friction against commercially available brake-lining materials and the formation of transfer or reactive layers (tribosurfaces). Homogeneous tribosurfaces allow for nearly wear-free brake systems under moderate brake conditions. In this work, preconditioning was carried out with a pin-on-disc tester, aiming for the fast creation of homogeneously formed and stable tribosurfaces. The influence of surface microedges perpendicular to the direction of friction on the machined AMC surfaces on the build-up speed and homogeneity of the tribosurfaces was investigated. The microedges were generated using ultrasonic-vibration-superimposed face turning. Thereby, the vibration direction corresponded to the direction of the passive force. For research purposes, the distance of the microedges was changed by varying the cutting speed and feed. The experiments were carried out using AMC disc specimens with a reinforcement content of a 35% volume proportion of silicon carbide particles. Machining was realised with CVD-diamond-tipped indexable inserts. The evaluation of the generated surfaces before and after preconditioning was achieved using 3D laser scanning microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. It was demonstrated that ultrasonic-vibration-superimposed face turning effectively generated microedges on the AMC surfaces. The results show that larger distances between the microedges enhanced the formation of stable tribosurfaces. Thus, the tribosystem’s steady state was reached quickly. Therefore, the benefits of AMC-friction-surface microstructuring on the generation of tribosurfaces under laboratory conditions were proven. These findings contribute to the development of high-performance AMC brake systems.},

ABSTRACT = {The thermoforming process is commonly used in industry for the manufacturing of lightweight, thin-walled products from a pre-extruded polymer sheet. Many simulations have been developed to simulate the process and optimize it with computer tools. The development of testing machines has simplified the simulation of this type of process, allowing researchers to characterize the behavior of the material at different temperatures and for large deformation to be closer to the real conditions of the process. This paper presents the results of a study on the modeling of the thermoforming process for an industrial demonstrator made from a high-impact polystyrene (HIPS) polymer. The HIPS shows a mechanical behavior that depends on the temperature and strain rate. In such conditions, a thermo-hyper-viscoelastic constitutive model is used to replicate the thermoforming process of the industrial demonstrator using ABAQUS/Explicit. Its behavior is determined via various experimental tests: uniaxial tensile tests at different temperatures and strain rates and Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (DMA). A comparison between the numerical and experimental results is carried out for the evolution of film thickness. The paper concludes with a discussion of possible improvements to be considered for future simulations of the thermoforming process using Abaqus, which presents complex challenges in terms of contact and material modeling.},

ABSTRACT = {In this research work, the suitability of short carbon fibre-reinforced polyamide 6 in pellet form for printing an aeronautical mould preform with specific thermomechanical requirements is investigated. This research study is based on an extensive experimental characterization campaign, in which the principal mechanical properties of the printed material are determined. Furthermore, the temperature dependency of the material properties is characterized by testing samples at different temperatures for bead printing and stacking directions. Additionally, the thermal properties of the material are characterized, including the coefficient of thermal expansion. Moreover, the influence of printing machine parameters is evaluated by comparing the obtained tensile moduli and strengths of several manufactured samples at room temperature. The results show that the moduli and strengths can vary from 78% to 112% and from 55% to 87%, respectively. Based on a real case study of its aeronautical use and on the experimental data from the characterization stage, a new mould design is iteratively developed with multiphysics computational guidance, considering 3D printing features and limitations. Specific design drivers are identified from the observed material’s thermomechanical performance. The designed mould, whose mass is reduced around 90% in comparison to that of the original invar design, is numerically proven to fulfil thermal and mechanical requirements with a high performance.},

ABSTRACT = {Complex thermo-kinetic interactions during metal additive manufacturing reduce the homogeneity of the microstructure of the produced samples. Understanding the effect of processing parameters over the resulting mechanical properties is essential for adopting and popularizing this technology. The present work is focused on the effect of laser power, scanning speed, and hatch spacing on the relative density, microhardness, and microstructure of 316L stainless steel processed by laser powder bed fusion. Several characterization techniques were used to study the microstructure and mechanical properties: optical, electron microscopies, and spectrometry. A full-factorial design of experiments was employed for relative density and microhardness evaluation. The results derived from the experimental work were subjected to statistical analysis, including the use of analysis of variance (ANOVA) to determine both the main effects and the interaction between the processing parameters, as well as to observe the contribution of each factor on the mechanical properties. The results show that the scanning speed is the most statistically significant parameter influencing densification and microhardness. Ensuring the amount of volumetric energy density (125 J/mm3) used to melt the powder bed is paramount; maximum densification (99.7%) is achieved with high laser power and low scanning speed, while hatch spacing is not statistically significant.},

The X and Y axes of the printer were the most performant and led to narrower potential and real tolerance intervals than the Z axis. The proposed systematic framework can be used to assess the performance of any material extrusion printer and its achievable tolerance intervals.},

ABSTRACT = {Hardfacing is commonly used in parts recovery and in obtaining surfaces with improved properties. Within this field, it is important to analyze the effect of alloying elements on the properties of the deposited layers. One of the critical parameters affecting alloying performances in SMAW is improper arc length. This article examines the effect of the addition of niobium in different quantities (0, 2, 4, 6, and 8% by weight) to the electrode coating in Fe-Cr-C shielded metal arc welding (SMAW), with short and long arc lengths, on the operational process efficiency, dilution, arc energy, microstructure, and microhardness of the deposited layers. A decrease in operational process efficiency and dilution was found with increases in niobium content. On the other hand, it was found that adding niobium leads to a refinement in chromium carbide sizes, directly affecting the hardness of the obtained deposits. There is a direct relationship between the arc energy, with both short and long arc lengths, leading to a tendency to decrease the dilution in the obtained hardfacing.},

ABSTRACT = {Extensive research in smart manufacturing and industrial grinding has targeted the enhancement of surface roughness for diverse materials including Inconel alloy. Recent studies have concentrated on the development of neural networks, as a subcategory of machine learning techniques, to predict non-linear roughness behavior in relation to various parameters. Nonetheless, this study introduces a novel set of parameters that have previously been unexplored, contributing to the advancement of surface roughness prediction for the grinding of Inconel 738 superalloy considering the effects of dressing and grinding parameters. Hence, the current study encompasses the utilization of a deep artificial neural network to forecast roughness. This implementation leverages an extensive dataset generated in a recent experimental study by the authors. The dataset comprises a multitude of process parameters across diverse conditions, including dressing techniques such as four-edge and single-edge diamond dresser, alongside cooling approaches like minimum quantity lubrication and conventional wet techniques. To evaluate a robust algorithm, a method is devised that involves different networks utilizing various activation functions and neuron sizes to distinguish and select the best architecture for this study. To gauge the accuracy of the methods, mean squared error and absolute accuracy metrics are applied, yielding predictions that fall within acceptable ranges for real-world industrial roughness standards. The model developed in this work has the potential to be integrated with the Industrial Internet of Things to further enhance automated machining.},

ABSTRACT = {Joining of Cu-based dispersion-strengthened alloys to Ni-based superalloys has garnered increased attention for liquid rocket engine applications due to the high thermal conductivity of Cu-based alloys and high temperature tensile strength of Ni-based superalloys. However, such joints can suffer from cracking when joined via liquid state processes, leading to part failure. In this work, compositions of 15–95 wt.% GRCop42 are alloyed with Inconel 625 and characterized to better understand the root cause of cracking. Results indicate a lack of miscibility between Cu-deprived and Cu-rich liquids in compositions corresponding to 30–95 wt.% GRCop42. Two distinct morphologies are observed and explained by use of CALPHAD; Cu-deprived dendrites with Cu-rich interdendritic zones at 30–50 wt.% GRCop42 and Cu-deprived spheres surrounded by a Cu-rich matrix at 60–95 wt.% GRCop42. Phase analysis reveals brittle intermetallic phases precipitate in the 60–95 wt.% GRCop42 Cu-deprived region. Three cracking mechanisms are proposed herein that provide guidance on the avoidance of defects Ni-based superalloy to Cu-based dispersion strengthened alloy joints.},

ABSTRACT = {Accurately predicting the time-varying dynamic parameters of a workpiece during the milling of thin-walled parts is the foundation of adaptively selecting chatter-free machining parameters. Hence, a method for accurately and quickly predicting the time-varying dynamic parameters for milling thin-walled parts is proposed, which is based on the shell FEM and a three-layer neural network. The time-dependent dynamics of the workpiece can be calculated using the FEM by obtaining the geometrical parameters of the arc-faced junctions within the discrete cells of the initial and machined workpiece. It is unnecessary to re-divide the mesh cells of the thin-walled parts at each cutting position, which enhances the computational efficiency of the workpiece dynamics. Meanwhile, in comparison with the three-dimensional cube elements, the shell elements can reduce the number of degrees of freedom of the FEM model by 74%, which leads to the computation of the characteristic equation that is about nine times faster. The results of the modal test show that the maximum error of the shell FEM in predicting the natural frequency of the workpiece is about 4%. Furthermore, a three-layer neural network is constructed, and the results of the shell FEM are used as samples to train the model. The neural network model has a maximum prediction error of 0.409% when benchmarked against the results of the FEM. Furthermore, the three-layer neural network effectively enhances computational efficiency while guaranteeing accuracy.},

ABSTRACT = {This article describes the technology for manufacturing a metal composite structure of a metal-cutting tool body. The main problem with using metal 3D-printing is its prohibitively high cost. The initial data for carrying out finite element calculations are presented, in particular, the calculation and justification of the selected loads on the drill body arising from metal-cutting forces. The described methodology for designing a digital model of a metal-cutting tool for the purpose of its further production using SLM 3D metal printing methods facilitates the procurement of a digital model characterized by a reduced weight and volume of material. The described design technology involves the production of a thin-walled outer shell that forms the external technological surfaces necessary for the drill body, as well as internal structural elements formed as a result of topological optimization of the product shape. Much attention in this article is paid to the description of the technology for filling internal cavities with a viscous metal polymer, formed as a result of the topological optimization of the original model. Due to this design approach, it is possible to reduce the volume of 3D metal printing by 32%, which amounts to more than USD 135 in value terms.},

ABSTRACT = {Laser cladding (LC) is a versatile additive manufacturing process where strands of metallic material are deposited and melted by a laser. However, there are some limitations associated with this process that may affect the performance of the final manufactured parts. In the present work, the influence of laser shock peening (LSP) on the fatigue life of 304 stainless steel flat specimens with a cobalt-based alloy (Stellite 6) coating applied by LC was investigated. The analysis was carried out both experimentally and numerically. In the LSP simulation, the ABAQUS/Explicit code was used to determine the residual stress distribution of specimens with double central notches with a radius of curvature of 5, 10, 15, and 20 mm. From the numerical results, an improvement was found regarding fatigue life up to 48% in samples with LSP. Experimentally, 14% in fatigue life enhancement was observed. The residual stress, determined by the contour method, showed good agreement with the LSP simulation. The SEM images revealed that the fatigue failure started at the Stellite 6 coating and propagated towards the center of the specimen. LSP has been shown to be a suitable postprocessing alternative for laser-cladded parts that will be subjected to fatigue loading since it led to fatigue improvement through the introduction of compressive residual stresses on clad coatings.},

ABSTRACT = {Shape-memory alloys set high demands on the production technologies being used. During cutting, continuous heat input and mechanical stress have an undesirable influence on the shape-memory effect. Pulsed electrochemical machining (PECM), which is based on anodic dissolution, enables force-free machining without thermomechanical influence on the edge-zone properties of the workpiece. Depending on the desired geometry, the development of a customized PECM fixture is necessary. The design of the fixtures is often based on the experiences of the designers and manufacturers, which often results in an estimation of the functionally critical dimensions. For this reason, the study focuses on a methodical approach for evaluating crucial fixture dimensions using knowledge of the specific material dissolution behavior linked with a numerical simulation model. It has been shown that the shape-memory alloy NiMnGa has a non-linear dissolution behavior in sodium nitrate. A reduction of stray currents up to 20% resulting from a lateral gap between the cathode and electrical insulation was demonstrated using numerical simulation. The study shows that a low cathode shaping height has the strongest influence on precise processing. Varying the process parameters allowed for the lateral gap to be adjusted between 0.15 and 0.25 mm.},

ABSTRACT = {Laser beam welding as a reliable tool for high-precision joining of batteries or microelectronics is more and more the choice for achieving reproducible results in production processes. In addition to a high automation capability, the precise control of the energy deposition into the material plays an important role, especially when highly reflective materials, such as copper or aluminum, must be welded together. Alongside the use of highly brilliant fiber lasers in the near-infrared range with a focal diameter of a few tens of micrometers, diode lasers in the wavelength range of 445 nm are increasingly being used. Here, beam diameters of a few hundred micrometers can be achieved. With a wavelength of 445 nm, the absorptivity in copper can be increased by more than a factor of 10 compared to a near-infrared laser beam sources in solid state at room temperature. This paper presents the in situ X-ray observation of laser welding processes on CuSn6 with a laser beam source with a wavelength of 445 nm using synchrotron radiation at DESY Petra III Beamline P07 EH4 in Hamburg, Germany. For the experiments, the laser radiation was focused via two separate optics to focal diameters of 362 µm and 609 µm. To characterize the dynamics of the vapor capillaries depending on the different focal diameters dF, the parameters were varied with respect to laser power PL and feed rate v. For the investigations, a synchrotron beam of 2 × 2 mm2 in size with a photon energy of 89 keV was used, and the material samples were analyzed by means of phase-contrast videography to show the boundaries between solid, liquid, and gaseous material phases. The results of this paper show the welding depths achieved and how the geometry of the vapor capillary behaves by changing the focal diameter, laser power and feed rate.},

ABSTRACT = {The 17-4 PH stainless steel is widely used in the aerospace, petrochemical, chemical, food, and general metallurgical industries. The present study was conducted to analyze the mechanical properties of two types of 17-4 PH stainless steel—commercial cold-rolled and direct metal laser sintering (DMLS) manufactured. This study employed linear and nonlinear tensile FEM simulations, combined with various materials characterization techniques such as tensile testing and nanoindentation. Moreover, microstructural analysis was performed using metallographic techniques, optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The results on the microstructure for 17-4 PH DMLS stainless steel reveal the layers of melting due to the laser process characterized by complex directional columnar structures parallel to the DMLS build direction. The mechanical properties obtained from the simple tension test decreased by 17% for the elastic modulus, 7.8% for the yield strength, and 7% for the ultimate strength for 17-4 PH DMLS compared with rolled 17-4 PH stainless steel. The FEM simulation using the experimental tension test data revealed that the 17-4 PH DMLS stainless steel experienced a decrease in the yield strength of ~8% and in the ultimate strength of ~11%. A reduction of the yield strength of the material was obtained as the grain size increased.},

ABSTRACT = {This experimental study probes the dynamic behaviour of a 3 mm ABS sheet during positive mould vacuum-assisted thermoforming. In this process, the sheet undergoes large and fast deformations caused by the applied vacuum and mechanical stretching by the mould. The objective is to elucidate the complexities of these large, rapid, and non-isothermal deformations. The non-isothermal conditions are caused by the radiative heating of the sheet, convective heat loss to the surrounding air, and conductive heat transfer from the sheet to the mould. By utilizing stereo digital image correlation (DIC) in tandem with thermal imaging, the present study accurately maps the occurring displacement, strain, and strain rate field in relation to real-time temperature variation in the material. The study progresses to observe the ABS material from the moment it contacts the mould until it conforms to a positive 250 mm diameter semi-sphere cast aluminum mould. The DIC methods are validated by comparing thickness values derived from DIC’s principal strain directions to ultrasonic thickness gauge readings. This knowledge not only broadens the understanding of the thermo-mechanical behaviour of the material but also aids in optimizing process parameters for improved thickness uniformity in thermoformed products.},

ABSTRACT = {In this study, the evolution of volume fractions during laser beam welding (LBW) of stainless steel, with a specific focus on incorporating the low transformation temperature (LTT) effect using the dilatometer, has been proposed. The LTT effect refers to the phase transformations that occur at lower temperatures and lead to the formation of a martensitic microstructure, which will significantly influence the residual stresses and distortion of the welded joints. In this research, the LTT conditions are achieved by varying the Cr and Ni content in the weld seam by varying the weld parameter, including laser power, welding speed and filler wire speed. The dilatometer analysis technique is employed to simulate the thermal conditions encountered during LBW. By subjecting the stainless steel samples to controlled heating and cooling cycles, the kinetics of the volume fractions can be measured using the lever rule and empirical method (KOP and Lee). The phase transformation simulation model is computed by integrating the thermal and metallurgical effects to predict the volume fractions in LBW joints and has been validated using dilatometer results. This provides valuable insight into the relationship between welding parameters and phase transformations in stainless steel with the LTT effect during laser beam welding. Using this relationship, the weld quality can be improved by reducing the residual stresses and distortion.},

ABSTRACT = {The material extrusion of plastics has matured into a lucrative and flexible alternative to conventional manufacturing. A major downside of this process is the missing quality assurance caused by the influence of process parameters on part quality. Such parameters—e.g., infill density and print speed—are selected prior to manufacturing. As a result, the achieved part quality is mostly unknown, limiting the use of material extrusion and leading to increased material costs and print times. A promising approach to overcome this drawback are prediction models, especially methods of machine learning. Yet, a methodology that enables their integration in the manufacturing process is lacking. This paper provides a methodology based on a lookup approach and calculated safety factors. The methodology is tested and subsequently applied to two exemplary use cases. The result empowers users and researchers with a methodology to use prediction models for quality assurance in their company environment. On the other hand, future improvements and new research results can be integrated into the methodology to verify its applicability in practice.},

The powder and material characterization studies are conducted in terms of an optical microscope, scanning electron microscope (SEM), electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and fractography analysis to explore the pre- and post-fabrication scenarios of the build parts. The consequences of energy density and process variables are studied through meticulous parametric studies. Finally, the optimum level of built parameters is identified and validated by a confirmative test predicting an average error of ~1.80%.

ABSTRACT = {Long fiber thermoplastic pellets are pellets containing discontinuous reinforced fibers and a matrix, offering excellent mechanical properties, good processability, recyclability, and low cost. Typically, commercial LFTP is manufactured through the hot melt impregnation process, combining extrusion and pultrusion. Although there is a thermoplastic pultrusion process for LFTP production, characterized by a simple machine and an easy method, its mechanical properties have not yet approached those of commercial LFTP. In improving the mechanical characteristics of LFTP manufactured via thermoplastic pultrusion, this research employed polypropylene-graft-maleic anhydride as a coupling agent during the injection molding procedure. The LFTP is composed of polypropylene material reinforced with glass fiber. Mechanical and physical properties of the LFTP were investigated by introducing PP-g-MAH at concentrations of 4, 8, and 12 wt% through injection molding. The results revealed that, at a 4 wt% concentration of PP-g-MAH, the LFTP composites exhibited heightened tensile, flexural and impact strengths. However, these properties began to decrease upon exceeding 4 wt% PP-g-MAH. The enhanced interfacial adhesion among glass fibers, induced by PP-g-MAH, contributed to this improvement. Nonetheless, excessive amounts of PP-g-MAH led to a reduction in molecular weight, subsequently diminishing the impact strength, tensile modulus, and flexural modulus. In LFTP composites, both tensile and flexural strengths exhibited a positive correlation with the PP-g-MAH concentration, attributed to improved interfacial adhesion between glass fibers and polypropylene, coupled with a reduction in fiber pull-out. Based on morphological analysis by SEM, the incorporation of PP-g-MAH improved interfacial bonding and decreased fiber pull-out. The presence of maleic anhydride in the LFTPc was confirmed through the utilization of FTIR spectroscopy. Mechanical properties of LFTP containing 4 wt% PP-g-MAH were found to be equivalent to or superior to those of commercial LFTP, according to the results of a comparative analysis.},

For all the samples, thermo-mechanical deformation occurred solely within the upper AA6082 plate. A refined grain structure was formed in the aluminum plate close to the surface. The dwell time was responsible for the intensity of the material flow, resulting in stirring between the Al-Si layer and the aluminum plate at 15 s.

ABSTRACT = {In this study, tensile test specimens were fabricated using a material extrusion 3D-printer at various printing temperatures to evaluate the development of physical bonds within the same layer as well as in between previous layers. The tensile test specimens were fabricated using PLA material, with printing temperatures ranging from 180 °C to 260 °C. Experimental investigations were conducted to investigate the dimensional accuracy and physical appearance of the parts across printing temperatures. Uniaxial tensile tests were conducted at a strain rate of 1 mm/min and repeated five times for each variable in accordance with the ASTM D638-14 standard. Results showed that increasing the printing temperatures yielded parts with better tensile properties. An approximate difference of 40% in tensile strength was observed between specimens fabricated under the two most extreme conditions (180 °C and 260 °C). The changes in tensile properties were attributed to bonding mechanisms related to interlayer bonding strength and a reduction in voids within the internal geometry. Analysis of the fracture surface using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed fewer and smaller voids within the internal geometry for parts printed at higher temperature. The percentage area of voids reduced significantly when the printing temperature was increased from 180 °C to 220 °C. The tensile properties continuously improved with the printing temperature, with parts printed at 220 °C exhibiting the highest dimensional accuracy. The findings offer insight into the impact of the printing temperature on both the external physical bonds between printed roads, affecting the physical appearance and dimensional accuracy, and the internal bonds, affecting the tensile properties of the fabricated parts.},

ABSTRACT = {Additive friction extrusion deposition (AFED) is a recently developed additive manufacturing technique that promises high deposition rates at low forces. Due to the novelty of the process, the underlying phenomena and their interactions are not fully understood, and in particular, the processing strategy and tool design are still in their infancy. This work contributes to the state-of-the-art of AFED through a comprehensive analysis of its working principles and an experimental program, including a representative sample component. The working principle and process mechanics of AFED are broken down into their individual components. The forces and their origins and effects on the process are described, and measures of process efficiency and theoretical minimum energy consumption are derived. Three geometrical features of the extrusion die were identified as most relevant to the active material flow, process forces, and deposition quality: the topography of the inner and outer circular surfaces and the geometry of its extrusion channels. Based on this, the experimental program investigated seven different tool designs in terms of efficiency, force reduction, and throughput. The experiments using AA 6061-T6 as feedstock show that AFED is capable of both high material throughput (close to 550 mm3/s) and reduced substrate forces, for example, the forces for a run at 100 mm3/s remained continuously below 500 N and for a run at 400 mm3/s below 3500 N. The material flow and microstructure of AFED were assessed from macro-sections. Significant differences were found between the advancing and retracting sides for both process effects and material flow. Banded structures in the microstructure show strong similarities to other solid-state processes. The manufacturing of the sample components demonstrates that AFED is already capable of producing industrial-grade components. In mechanical tests, interlayer bonding defects resulted in more brittle failure behavior in the build direction of the structure, whereas in the horizontal direction, mechanical properties corresponding to a T4 temper were achieved.},

ABSTRACT = {The utilization of Al2O3 nanopowder to reinforce AA5754 aluminum alloy through blind holes employing the friction stir processing (FSP) technique to produce an aluminum matrix nanocomposite is explored in this paper. Motivated by the necessity to enhance the strength and ductility of welded joints, the impacts of varying the tool rotational speed (rpm) and blind hole diameter on the microstructure and mechanical properties of the joints are investigated. Experimental characterization techniques including SEM, optical microscopy, microhardness, and tensile tests were employed to analyze the welded joints produced under different processing parameters (tool rotational speeds of 910, 1280, and 1700 rpm, and blind hole diameters of 0, 1, 1.5, and 2 mm). Comparative analyses were conducted against base metal properties and joints without reinforcement powder. It was found that the addition of nanopowder resulted in a decrease in the maximum generated heat during FSP, while also reducing the stir zone size compared to samples without nanopowder. Moreover, enhancements in both the strength and ductility of the joints were observed with the incorporation of Al2O3 nanoparticles. The optimal combination of welding conditions, observed at 1280 rpm rotational speed and 1.5 mm hole diameter, yielded a remarkable ultimate tensile strength of 567 MPa, accompanied by a hardness of 45 HV. These results underscore the potential of nano-Al2O3 reinforcement in significantly improving the mechanical properties of the produced nanocomposite, with implications for advancing the performance of welded structures in various engineering applications.},

ABSTRACT = {Additive Manufacturing (AM) has emerged as an innovative technology that gives designers several advantages, such as geometric freedom of design and less waste. However, the quality of the parts produced is affected by different design and manufacturing parameters, such as the part orientation, the nozzle temperature and speed, the support material, and the layer thickness. In this context, the layer thickness is considered an important AM parameter affecting the part quality and accuracy. Thus, in this paper, a new adaptative slicing method based on the cusp vector and the surface deviation is proposed with the aim of minimizing the dimensional defects of FFF printed parts and investigate the impact on the dimensional part tolerancing. An algorithm is developed to automatically extract data from the STL file, select the build orientation, and detect intersection points between the initial slicing and the STL mesh. The innovation of this algorithm is exhibited via adapting the slicing according to the surface curvature based on two factors: the cusp vector and the surface deviation. The suggested slicing technique guarantees dimensional accuracy, especially for complex feature shapes that are challenging to achieve using a uniform slicing approach. Finally, a preview of the slicing is displayed, and the G-code is generated to be used by the FFF machine. The case study consists of the dimensional tolerance inspection of prototypes manufactured using the conventional and adaptive slicing processes. The proposed method’s effectiveness is investigated using RE and CMM processes. The method demonstrates its reliability through the observed potential for accuracy improvements exceeding 0.6% and cost savings of up to 4.3% in specific scenarios. This reliability is substantiated by comparing the resulting dimensional tolerances and manufacturing costs.},

ABSTRACT = {A novel process design for the damage-free and highly accurate positional integration of an optical multi-axial force sensor into a hollow tube by means of rotary swaging is introduced. Numerical simulations reveal the relevant process phenomena of thin disc joining inside a pre-toothed hollow tube and help us to find an optimal process design. Experimental trials show the significant effect of the axial material flow and the number of tools on the rotary swaging process. By taking these effects into account, successful form- and force-fit joining of the sensor carrying discs into the tube can be achieved. Successful joining of an optical sensor for bending force and torque measurement shows hysteresis-free sensory behavior and thus backlash-free joining of the sensor carrier discs. The paper concludes with a presentation of the results of a numerical study on a potential closed-loop approach to the joining process.},

ABSTRACT = {Context—Rapidly solidified aluminium alloy (RSA 443) is increasingly used in the manufacturing of optical mold inserts because of its fine nanostructure, relatively low cost, excellent thermal properties, and high hardness. However, RSA 443 is challenging for single-point diamond machining because the high silicon content mitigates against good surface finishes. Objectives—The objectives were to investigate multiple different ways to optimize the process parameters for optimal surface roughness on diamond-turned aluminium alloy RSA 443. The response surface equation was used as input to three different artificial intelligence tools, namely genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and differential evolution (DE), which were then compared. Results—The surface roughness machinability of RSA443 in single-point diamond turning was primarily determined by cutting speed, and secondly, cutting feed rate, with cutting depth being less important. The optimal conditions for the best surface finish Ra = 14.02 nm were found to be at the maximum rotational speed of 3000 rpm, cutting feed rate of 4.84 mm/min, and depth of cut of 14.52 µm with optimizing error of 3.2%. Regarding optimization techniques, the genetic algorithm performed best, then differential evolution, and finally particle swarm optimization. Originality—The study determines optimal diamond machining parameters for RSA 443, and identifies the superiority of GA above PSO and DE as optimization methods. The principles have the potential to be applied to other materials (e.g., in the RSA family) and machining processes (e.g., turning, milling).},

ABSTRACT = {This study addresses the effects of densification at varied pelletization temperatures on the novel Malaysian Khaya senegalensis wood-derived pellets biomass fuel characteristics. The lack of comprehensive understanding regarding the biomass fuel characteristics of this species prompted the research. By addressing this knowledge gap, this study explores the impact of temperature variations on key fuel properties, contributing to the optimization of sustainable biomass fuel production in manufacturing and materials processing. Khaya senegalensis wood, grown and harvested in Malaysia, was pelletized at different temperatures to analyze the calorific value, volatile matter content, ash content, fixed carbon, bulk density, and moisture contents of the pellets. The experimental data revealed a significant relationship between temperature and these fuel properties. Pelletizing at 75 °C produced the highest calorific value of 19.47 MJ/kg and the maximum fixed carbon content of 10.04%. A low ash level of 4.26% was achieved via pelletizing at 75 °C. According to the results, 75 °C produced the best thermophysical properties. These findings provide valuable understanding of how pelletization temperature influences fuel pellet thermophysical properties, a critical aspect in optimizing fuel pellet production, storage, advancing renewable energy resource utilization, and, finally, promoting a cleaner and more sustainable energy future.},

ABSTRACT = {Additive manufacturing of plastic components in medical technology enables greater freedom of design when designing patient-specific products, in particular, in production of customised medical products, such as orthoses. In the present contribution, the advantages of a digital process chain are combined, from the 3D scan of the patient to CAD-supported modelling of the corrective form and the orthosis design until the path planning of a printable geometry. The main disadvantages of current additive printing techniques, such as the fused filament fabrication (FFF) process, are high printing times (>12 h) for larger components as well as the low degree of freedom in the 2.5D printing technique that prevent the subsequent application of geometry features to the product. The fast SEAMHex (Screw Extrusion Additive Manufacturing) printing technology with a hexapod kinematic printing bed provides a solution to the mentioned difficulties. Consequently, the high-performance printer has been prepared for the individual requirements of medical technology in terms of materials and geometries. An effective additive manufacturing process has been realised and tested in combination with a digital process chain for orthosis modelling.},

ABSTRACT = {Additively manufactured fibre-reinforced polymers are gaining traction. After the development and optimisation of a novel fibre-deposition system in a laser sintering (LS) setup, polyamide 12 specimens were produced with and without glass fibres. In this study, the relation between the crystallinity, porosity, and mechanical properties of LS specimens with and without fibres is investigated. After testing as-built LS specimens, a detrimental effect of the fibres on the specimens’ performance was observed with a decrease in UTS of 6%. The degree of crystallinity remained the same; however, a porosity content of 2.6% was observed in specimens with fibres. These pores can have a negative influence on the bonding between the fibres and the matrix. To investigate the influence of the pores, warm isostatic pressing (WIP) was performed on LS specimens with and without fibres. The WIP process shows a positive influence on the specimens without fibres, resulting in an increase in UTS of 8.5%. The influence of the WIP process on specimens with fibres, however, is much less pronounced, with an increase in UTS of only 2%. Neither the crystallinity nor the porosity are the cause of the less-than-expected increase in UTS in LS specimens with fibres. A number of hypotheses and mitigation strategies are provided.},

ABSTRACT = {This work emphasizes an innovative approach utilizing 3D imaging technology based on synchrotron radiation to assess the microstructure of second-phase iron particles and the porous structure within 3D-printed PLA/magnetic iron composites at different printing angles. The study examines how these observations relate to the material’s ductility when processed using fused filament fabrication. In particular, this study examines the impact of one processing parameter, specifically the printing angle, on the microstructure and mechanical behaviour of a polylactic acid (PLA)–iron (PLI) composite designed for magnetic actuation. Fused filament fabrication is employed to produce PLI tensile specimens, with varied printing angles to create different layups. X-ray microtomography is utilized to analyse the microstructure, while tensile mechanical properties are evaluated for all composites, with findings discussed in relation to printing angle conditions. Scanning Electron Microscopy is used to examine the fractography of broken specimens. Results indicate that the printing angle significantly influences the tensile properties and mechanical anisotropy of 3D-printed PLI composites, with an optimal 45°/45° layup enhancing tensile performance. These findings suggest that 3D-printed PLI composites offer a cost-efficient means of producing bio-sourced, light-adaptive materials with intricate magnetic actuation capabilities. By quantifying the modulation of mechanical properties based on printing parameters that influence microstructural arrangement, the research sheds light on a novel aspect of composite material characterization.},

ABSTRACT = {The application of computer vision and machine learning methods for semantic segmentation of the structural elements of 3D-printed products in the field of additive manufacturing (AM) can improve real-time failure analysis systems and potentially reduce the number of defects by providing additional tools for in situ corrections. This work demonstrates the possibilities of using physics-based rendering for labeled image dataset generation, as well as image-to-image style transfer capabilities to improve the accuracy of real image segmentation for AM systems. Multi-class semantic segmentation experiments were carried out based on the U-Net model and the cycle generative adversarial network. The test results demonstrated the capacity of this method to detect such structural elements of 3D-printed parts as a top (last printed) layer, infill, shell, and support. A basis for further segmentation system enhancement by utilizing image-to-image style transfer and domain adaptation technologies was also considered. The results indicate that using style transfer as a precursor to domain adaptation can improve real 3D printing image segmentation in situations where a model trained on synthetic data is the only tool available. The mean intersection over union (mIoU) scores for synthetic test datasets included 94.90% for the entire 3D-printed part, 73.33% for the top layer, 78.93% for the infill, 55.31% for the shell, and 69.45% for supports.},

ABSTRACT = {Carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) composites have gradually replaced metals due to their exceptional strength-to-weight ratio compared to metallic materials. However, the drilling process often reveals various defects, such as surface roughness, influenced by different drilling parameters. This study explores the drilling quality of uni-directional CFRP composites, as well as hybrid Al2O3 alumina and hybrid SiC silicon carbide nano-composites, through experimental exploration using step, core, and twist drills. Response surface methodology (RSM) and statistical tools, including main effect plots, ANOVA, contour plots, and optimization techniques, were used to analyze the surface roughness of the hole. Optimization plots were drawn for optimal conditions, suggesting a spindle speed of 1500 rpm, feed of 0.01 mm/rev, and a 4 mm drill diameter for achieving minimum surface roughness. Furthermore, two machine learning models, artificial neural network (ANN) and random forest (RF), were used for predictive analysis. The findings revealed the robust predictive capabilities of both models, with RF demonstrating superior performance over ANN and RSM. Through visual comparisons and error analyses, more insights were gained into model accuracy and potential avenues for improvement.},

ABSTRACT = {The conventional cutting tools used for machining titanium alloys normally experience rapid tool wear, and it is generally difficult to achieve a cutting speed over 60 m/min. In this paper, a comprehensive study on improving the machining of Ti-6Al-4V alloy is presented, focusing on high-speed end milling at 100 m/min. Three different AlCrN PVD-coated cemented carbide tools were employed over cemented solid carbide endmills. The study aimed to understand the factors influencing tool performance and, particularly, the uncommon tool wear behavior characterized by chipping on the rake face. The research methodology involves a detailed investigation of coating properties, mechanical characteristics, surface defects, and tool edge geometries. Mechanical properties were measured to assess the resistance to plastic deformation and impact fatigue fracture resistance. Surface defects were meticulously observed, and tool edge geometries were evaluated through optical microscopies. These analyses uncover the key factors contributing to the best tool performance, notably the resistance to plastic deformation (H3/E2 ratio), impact fatigue fracture resistance, and maintaining uniform tool edge geometries. The results of this study reveal that the moderate stress C3 coating outperformed the other two coatings, exhibiting a 1.5-times-longer tool life, a relatively stable cutting force curve, and favorable friction conditions in the cutting zone.},

ABSTRACT = {Minimum quantity lubrication (MQL) technologies possess great potential for improving the sustainability of manufacturing processes, which can reduce the absolute quantity of metalworking fluid (MWF) and also enable near-dry chips that are easier to recycle. During drilling in particular, the MWF is transported to the contact zone through internal cooling channels of the drilling tool. The MWF supply and its associated flow behaviour in the transfer from the outlet of the cooling channels to the contact zone have not been sufficiently investigated yet. Great potential is seen in the proper delivery of the MQL into the contact zone. This work aims to visualize and quantify the cooling lubricant supply into the cutting zone using the MQL technique. The visualization of the MQL application is made possible by high-speed shadowgraphic imaging. Detailed image processing is used to evaluate the resulting images. The developed evaluation routine allows for the assessment of the impact of the main process parameters such as the varying pressure of the aerosol generator and the cooling channel diameter. It is found that the oil leaves the cooling channels at the tip of the drill bit in the form of ligaments. An increase in pressure and cooling channel diameter leads to an increase in the frequency of oil ligament separation. Three main flow regimes are identified with different separation frequencies. Low inlet pressures result in intermittently dispersed droplets. The most upper pressure levels lead to an almost continuous dispersion of the oil. At the same time, the air and oil mass flow rates also increase.},

ABSTRACT = {Laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) is widely used in metal additive manufacturing to create geometrically complex parts, where heat transfer and its affected temperature distribution significantly influence the parts’ materials’ microstructure and the resulting materials’ properties. Among all the microstructure representations, crystallographic orientations play a paramount role in determining the mechanical properties of materials. This paper first developed a physics-based analytical model to predict the 3D temperature distribution in PBF considering heat transfer boundary conditions; heat input using point-moving heat source solutions; and heat loss due to heat conduction, convection, and radiation. The superposition principle obtained temperature distributions based on linear heat sources and linear heat loss solutions. Then, the temperature distribution was used to analytically obtain the texture grown on a substrate with random grain orientations considering columnar-to-equiaxed transition (CET). Thus, the link between process parameters and texture was established through CET models and physical rules. Ti-6Al-4V was selected to demonstrate the capability of the analytical model in a single-phase situation. By applying advanced thermal models, the accuracy of the texture prediction was evaluated based on a comparison of experimental data from the literature and past analytical model results. Hence, this work not only provides a method of the fast analytical simulation of texture prediction in the single-phase mode for metallic materials but also paves the road for subsequent studies on microstructure-affected or texture-affected materials’ properties for both academic research and industrial applications. The prediction of single-phase material texture has never been achieved before, and the scalability has been expanded.},

ABSTRACT = {Various defects are produced during the laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) process, which can affect the quality of the fabricated part. Previous studies have revealed that the defects formed are correlated with molten pool dimensions. Powder particles are thinly spread on a substrate during the L-PBF process; hence, powder packing properties should influence the molten pool dimensions. This study evaluated the influence of particle size on powder packing properties and molten pool dimensions obtained through numerical simulations. Using particles with different average diameters (Dav) of 24, 28, 32, 36, and 40 μm, a series of discrete-element method (DEM) simulations were performed. The packing fraction obtained from DEM simulations became high as Dav became small. Several particles piled up for small Dav, whereas particles spread with almost one-particle diameter thickness for large Dav. Moreover, the packing structure was inhomogeneous and sparse for large Dav. As a result of multiphysics computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations incorporating particles’ positions as initial solid metal volume, the molten pool width obtained was hardly dependent on the Dav and was roughly equivalent to the laser spot size used in the simulations. In contrast, the molten pool depth decreased as Dav decreased. Even if the powder bed thickness is the same, small particles can form a complex packing structure by piling up, resulting in a large specific surface area. This can lead to a complex laser reflection compared to the large particles coated with almost one-particle thickness. The complex reflection absorbs the heat generated by laser irradiation inside the powder bed formed on the substrate. As a result, the depth of the molten pool formed below the substrate is reduced for small particles.},

ABSTRACT = {The directed energy deposition (DED) parameters were determined for near-β alloy Ti-55511 by employing statistical design of experiments (DOEs) methods. Parameters resulting in fully dense freeform deposits were identified using two sequential DOEs. Single laser tracks were printed with several laser power, traverse rate, and powder feed rate settings in an initial DOE to identify promising build parameters. The capture efficiency and effective deposition rate were used to characterize and rank the single track deposits. The best parameters were then used to print a solid cube with various X–Y and Z overlaps (different hatch spacing, HS, and layer thickness, ZS) in a second DOE. Suitable deposition parameters were selected based on the cube density and microstructure and were used to fabricate larger tensile samples for mechanical testing. Multiple parameter sets were found to provide dense Ti-55511 deposits with acceptable mechanical properties and the parametric models showed statistical significance.},

ABSTRACT = {The monitoring of additive manufacturing processes such as powder bed fusion enables the detection of several process quantities important to the quality of the built part. In this context, radiation-based monitoring techniques have been used to obtain information about the melt pool and the general temperature distribution on the surface of the powder bed. High temporal and spatial resolution have been achieved at the cost of large storage requirements. This contribution aims to offer an alternative strategy of gaining information about the powder bed’s temperature field with sufficient resolution but with an economical amount of data. The investigated measurement setup uses a spectrometer to detect the spectral radiation intensities emitted by an area enclosing the melt pool and part of its surroundings. An analytical description of this process is presented, which shows that the measured spectral entities can be reconstructed by the Ritz method. It is also shown that the corresponding weighting factors can be physically interpreted as subdomains of constant temperature within the measurement area. Two different test cases are numerically analyzed, showing that the methodology allows for an approximation of the melt pool size while further assumptions remain necessary to reconstruct the actual temperature distribution.},

ABSTRACT = {The influence of hot-top designs with different heat capacities on the distribution of positive and negative macrosegregation was investigated on a 12 metric tonne (MT) cast ingot made using Cr-Mo low-alloy steel. The three-dimensional finite element modeling code THERCAST® was used to simulate the thermo-mechanical phenomena associated with the solidification process, running from filling the mold until complete solidification. The model was validated on an industrial-scale ingot and then utilized to evaluate the influence of the thermal history of the hot-top, a crucial component in the cast ingot setup. This assessment aimed to comprehend changes in solidification time, temperature, and heat flux—all of which contribute to the determination of macrosegregation severity. The results showed that preheating the hot-top had a minor effect on solidification time, while modifications of thermal conductivity in the hot-top region increased the solidification time by 31%, thereby significantly affecting the macrosegregation patterns. The results are discussed and interpreted in terms of the fundamental mechanisms governing the kinetics of solidification and macrosegregation phenomena.},

ABSTRACT = {Various industries, including mechanical engineering, utilize steel rings featuring variable cross-sectional profiles, such as eccentric rings. Presently employed methods for producing eccentric rings possess drawbacks like restricted geometries, significant material wastage or uneven microstructures. The radial–axial ring rolling process serves to create seamless rolled steel rings with near-net-shaped cross-sections. A novel technique involves achieving eccentricity by dynamically adjusting the mandrel’s position during the ring rolling process. This method’s fundamental feasibility has previously been showcased using a blend of oil clay and a labor test bench. Transferring the possibility of manufacturing eccentric rings on industrial radial–axial ring rolling mills would expand the product range of ring manufacturers without encountering drawbacks associated with existing manufacturing processes. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate the basic feasibility of the concept of an industrial radial–axial ring rolling mill. In the first step, FEA simulation studies were carried out to develop the rolling strategy and estimate the achievable eccentricity on the institute’s radial–axial ring mill. Subsequently, the rolling strategy was implemented on an industrial ring rolling mill with the help of a unique technology module programmed in C++. Finally, an eccentric ring was ring rolled and compared with the FEA simulation, and the reproducibility was demonstrated to be successful.},

ABSTRACT = {Four dimensional printing enables the advanced manufacturing of smart objects that can morph and adapt shape over time in response to stimuli such as heat. This study presents a single-material 4D printing workflow which explores the residual stress and anisotropy arising from the fused deposition modelling (FDM) printing process to create heat-triggered self-morphing objects. In particular, the study first investigates the effect of printing patterns on the residual stress of FDM-printed acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) products. Through finite element analysis, the raster angle of printing patterns was identified as the key parameter influencing the distribution of residual stresses. Experimental investigations further reveal that the non-uniform distribution of residual stress results in the anisotropic thermal deformation of printed materials. Thus, through the design of printing patterns, FDM-printed materials can be programmed with desired built-in residual stresses and anisotropic behaviours for initiating and controlling the transformation of 4D-printed objects. Using the proposed approach, any desktop FDM printers can be turned into 4D printers to create smart objects that can self-morph into target geometries. A series of 4D printing prototypes manufactured from conventional ABS 3D printing feedstock are tested to illustrate the use and reliability of this new workflow. Additionally, the custom-made wood–plastic composite (WPC) feedstocks are explored in this study to demonstrate the transposability of the 4D printing approach.},

ABSTRACT = {Additive manufacturing (AM) by using direct metal deposition (DMD) often causes erratic distortion patterns, especially on large parts. This study presents a systematic distortion analysis by employing numerical approaches using transient–thermal and structural simulations, experimental approaches using tomography, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and an analytical approach calculating the buckling distortion of a piston. The most essential geometrical features are thin walls situated between massive rings. An eigenvalue buckling analysis, a DMD process, and heat treatment simulation are presented. The eigenvalue buckling simulation shows that it is highly dependent on the mesh size. The computational effort of the DMD and heat treatment simulation was reduced through simplifications. Moreover, artificial imperfections were imposed in the heat treatment simulation, which moved the part into the buckling state inspired by the experiment. Although the numerical results of both simulations are successful, the eigenvalue and DMD simulation cannot be validated through tomography and XRD. This is because tomography is unable to measure small elastic strain fields, the simulated residual stresses were overestimated, and the part removal disturbed the residual stress equilibrium. Nevertheless, the heat treatment simulation can predict the distortion pattern caused by an inhomogeneous temperature field during ambient cooling in an oven. The massive piston skirt cools down and shrinks faster than the massive core. The reduced yield strength at elevated temperatures and critical buckling load leads to plastic deformation of the thin walls.},

ABSTRACT = {Induction heating is a fast, reproducible, and efficient heating method used in various manufacturing processes. However, there is no established additive manufacturing (AM) process based on induction heating using wire as feedstock. This study investigates a novel approach to AM based on inductive heating, where a steel wire is melted and droplets are detached periodically using a two-winding induction coil. The process parameters and energy input into the droplets are characterized. The induction generator exhibits a sluggish response to the excitation voltage, resulting in a lag in the coil current. The process is captured using a high-speed camera, revealing a regular droplet formation of 14 Hz and uniform shapes and sizes between 2.11 and 2.65 mm in diameter when operated within an appropriate process window. Larger drops and increased spatter formation occur outside this window. The proposed method allows for the production of droplets with almost spherical shapes. Further analysis and characterization of droplet formation and energy input provide insights into process optimization and indicate an overall efficiency of approximately 10%.},

ABSTRACT = {In the last fifteen years, several groups have investigated metal injection moulding (MIM) of NdFeB powder to produce isotropic or anisotropic rare earth magnets of greater geometric complexity than that achieved by the conventional pressing and sintering approach. However, due to the powder’s high affinity for oxygen and carbon uptake, sufficient remanence and coercivity remains difficult. This article presents a novel approach to producing NdFeB magnets from recycled material using Powder Extrusion Moulding (PEM) in a continuous process. The process route uses powder obtained from recycling rare earth magnets through Hydrogen Processing of Magnetic Scrap (HPMS). This article presents the results of tailored powder processing, the production of mouldable feedstock based on a special binder system, and moulding with PEM to produce green and sintered parts. The magnetic properties and microstructures of debinded and sintered samples are presented and discussed, focusing on the influence of filling ratio and challenging processing conditions on interstitial content as well as density and magnetic properties.},

ABSTRACT = {This study presents a new gas metal arc welding (GMAW) technique that achieves both high efficiency and low heat input using a hybridization of the hot-wire method. The optimal combination of welding speed and welding current conditions was investigated using a fixed hot-wire feeding speed of 10 m/min on a butt joint with a V-shaped groove using 19 mm thick steel plates. Molten pool stability and defect formation were observed using high-speed imaging and cross-sectional observations. The power consumption and heat input were predicted prior to welding and measured in the experiments. The results indicate that a combination of a welding current of 350–500 A and welding speed of 0.3–0.7 m/min is optimal to avoid defect formation and molten metal precedence using three or four passes. The higher efficiency and lower heat input achieved by hot-wire GMAW results in a weld metal of adequate hardness, narrower heat-affected zone, smaller grain size at the fusion boundary, and lower power consumption than those obtained using tandem GMAW and high-current GMAW. Based on the experimental results, a single bevel groove, which is widely used in construction machinery welding joints, was welded using hot-wire GMAW, and we confirmed that the welding part could be welded in six passes, whereas eight passes were required with GMAW only.},

The main objective is to explore how cutting parameters (cutting speed and feed rate), heat treatment, alloy composition, and cooling methods influence A lcutting force. In the initial phase of the investigation, all three alloys underwent heat treatment. Subsequently, the machining process centered on the softest and hardest conditions, aiming at analyzing the impact of hardness on machinability behavior of the three studied alloys, using the same milling tool and a consistent depth of cut under both dry and wet conditions. The investigations also highlight the role of Li and Sc additions on the quality of surface finish, as well as burr and chip formation.

ABSTRACT = {This article outlines the relevance of building online telemetry systems for online monitoring of the technical conditions of rolling mill equipment. Electromechanical systems of the horizontal stand of the plate Mill 5000 are described, when operating in harsh conditions caused by the shock loading when workpieces enter the stand. It is noted that dynamic torque overloads, exceeding the rated motor torque by many-fold, cause the fatigue failure of spindle joints and breakage of rolls. In this regard, the development and implementation of systems for monitoring the elastic torque on spindles are extremely urgent. This issue has long been studied, but the references provide no information on the building principles and hardware composition of such systems. The use of strain gauges connected according to a balanced bridge circuit to measure the elastic torque is justified. This paper’s contribution is the proposed modular principle for building a telemetry monitoring system based on the analysis of known techniques for measuring and transmitting diagnostic data. The developed system structure is provided and the concept of data transfer and processing are explained. This article suggests the inductive power supply of a measuring unit mounted on a shaft without the use of batteries. A hardware structure was developed to be applied in a system for measuring, transmitting, and visualizing signals proportional to the elastic torque, manufactured on the basis of data measuring instruments by leading companies. The specifics of placement and connection of strain gauges are considered. The hardware providing a wireless power supply to the signal encoder and digital data transfer between the transmitter and receiver is described. The results of implementing the system on Mill 5000 are provided. The installation of a telemetry ring and a receiving head for the inductive power supply and data reception is shown. An experimental assessment of the elastic torques occurring when workpieces enter the cage was obtained by implementing a drive control algorithm which provided biting in the drive acceleration mode. The reliability of measuring the elastic torque with an error not exceeding ±5% and the reduction of dynamic loads on the spindle by 1.3–1.5 times due to the elimination of impacts from closing angular gaps in spindle joints was confirmed. This increases the service life of mechanical equipment and reduces the cost of eliminating the accident aftermath. The prospect of modifying the developed system into a cyber-physical system for monitoring the rolling mill’s mechatronic equipment conditions is shown.},

ABSTRACT = {Bio-inspired gyroid triply periodic minimum surface (TPMS) lattice structures have been the focus of research in automotive engineering because they can absorb a lot of energy and have wider plateau ranges. The main challenge is determining the optimal energy absorption capacity and accurately capturing plastic plateau areas using finite element analysis (FEA). Using nTop’s Boolean subtraction method, this study combined walled TPMS gyroid structures with a normal TPMS gyroid lattice. This made a composite TPMS gyroid lattice (CTG) with relative densities ranging from 14% to 54%. Using ideaMaker 4.2.3 (3DRaise Pro 2) software and the fused deposition modeling (FDM) Raise3D Pro 2 3D printer to print polylactic acid (PLA) bioplastics in 1.75 mm filament made it possible to slice computer-aided design (CAD) models and fabricate 36 lattice samples precisely using a layer-by-layer technique. Shimadzu 100 kN testing equipment was utilized for the mechanical compression experiments. The finite element approach validates the results of mechanical compression testing. Further, a composite CTG was examined using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) before and after compression testing. The composite TPMS gyroid lattice showed potential as shock absorbers for vehicles with relative densities of 33%, 38%, and 54%. The Gibson–Ashby model showed that the composite TPMS gyroid lattice deformed mainly by bending, and the size effect was seen when the relative densities were less than 15%. The lattice’s relative density had a significant impact on its ability to absorb energy. The research also explored the use of these innovative foam-like composite TPMS gyroid lattices in high-speed crash box scenarios to potentially enhance vehicle safety and performance. The structures have tremendous potential to improve vehicle safety by acting as advanced shock absorbers, which are particularly effective at higher relative densities.},

Both rectangular and circular specimens were machined at high cutting speeds (up to 50 m/min) in order to understand what occurred for all values of fiber orientation angles during machining operations. An innovative testing methodology was proposed and studied to investigate the phenomenon of burr formation and thus understand how to avoid it during machining operations. To this end, the forces arising during the machining process and the roughness of the resulting surface were carefully studied and correlated with the cutting angle. Additionally, the cutting surface and chip morphology formed during cutting tests were examined using a high-speed camera. Close correlations were found between the variations in the cutting forces’ signals and the trends of the surface roughness and the morphology of the machined surface.},

ABSTRACT = {Joining high strength 2xxx series aluminum is known to be complex and difficult; these alloys are traditionally considered non-weldable for fusion welding. This paper describes details on welding AA2029-T8 for skin-stiffened structures using refill friction stir spot welding (RFSSW). RFSSW is a solid-state process invented in the early 2000s that produces spot welds that are strong, lightweight, flush, and hermetic. Cycle times between 1 and 3 s are discussed, and process forces within a range of 8 to 14 kN are demonstrated. Furthermore, lap-shear quasi-static tensile strengths are shown to be between 10 kN and 12 kN in 9 mm diameter spots. A comparison of the performance of RFSSW welds made with various tool materials—which include H13 tool steel, tungsten carbide, and MP159—is detailed. Comparisons of parameters, weld consolidation, and heat-affected zones are presented with discussion related to heat generation specific to each tool material.},

ABSTRACT = {The production of materials with a high affinity for oxidation using the direct metal deposition (DMD) process requires an extended process examination that goes beyond the usual, purely energetic consideration, with the aim of providing sufficient energy to melt the substrate and the powder material supplied. This is because the DMD process does not allow any conclusions to be drawn as to whether it and its respective selected parameters result in an oxidation critical process. To assess this, a superposition of the temperature field with the existing spatial oxygen concentration is required. This work uses this approach to develop an oxidation model that reduces oxidation during the DMD process. In addition to the numerical model, an analytical model is derived, with which the temperature of a material element can be calculated analytically and the resulting boundary oxygen concentration calculated using Fick’s 2nd law. The model also takes into account two-stage oxidation kinetics for Ti alloys. The effect of too high a travel speed (with the same specific energy of the other experiments) is shown visually in the numerical calculation of the temperature field. However, if the process model is taken into account, the components do fulfil the specified requirements. Finally, the effect of oxidation on the microstructure, microhardness, ultimate strength, yield strength and elongation at failure of Ti6Al4V structures produced using DMD is also investigated, and further supports our conclusions regarding the effectiveness of the proposed model.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, we present an experimental procedure to enhance the dimensional accuracy of fabrication via stereolithography (SLA) of features at the sub-mm scale. Deviations in sub-mm hemispherical cavity diameters were detected and measured on customized samples by confocal microscopy. The characterization and experimental observations of samples allowed the identification of inaccuracy sources, mainly due to the laser beam scanning strategy and the incomplete removal of uncured liquid resin in post-processing (i.e., IPA washing). As a technology baseline, the measured dimensional errors on cavity diameters were up to −46%. A compensation method was defined and implemented, resulting in relevant improvements in dimensional accuracy. However, measurements on sub-mm cavities having different sizes revealed that a constant compensation parameter (i.e., C = 85, 96, 120 μm) is not fully effective at the sub-mm scale, where average errors remain at −24%, −18.8%, and −16% for compensations equal to 85, 96 and 120 μm, respectively. A further experimental campaign allowed the identification of an effective nonlinear compensation law where the compensation parameter depends on the sub-mm feature size C = f(D). Results show a sharp improvement in dimensional accuracy on sub-mm cavity fabrication, with errors consistently below +8.2%. The proposed method can be extended for the fabrication of any sub-mm features without restrictions on the specific technology implementation.},

ABSTRACT = {Laser-assisted automated tape placement systems are currently the state of the art regarding thermoplastic tape placement. Flashlamp heating systems are rather new in this field of application and offer high energy density with low safety requirements and moderate costs compared to laser-assisted automated tape placement systems. In this study, the effect of processing parameters on interlaminar bonding of carbon fiber-reinforced polyamide 6 tapes is investigated using a flashlamp heating system. The temperature during placement is monitored using an infrared camera, and the bonding strength is characterized by a wedge peel test. The bonding quality of the tapes placed between 210 °C and 330 °C at a lay-up speed of 50 mm/s is investigated. Thermogravimetric analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, and micrographs are used to investigate the material properties and effects of the processing conditions on the thermophysical properties and geometric properties of the tape. No significant changes in the thermophysical or geometric properties were found. Moisture within the tapes and staining of the quartz guides of the flashlamp system have significant influence on the bonding strength. The highest wedge peel strength of dried tapes was found at around 330 °C.},

ABSTRACT = {High-feed milling (HFM) represents a progressive manufacturing technology that has recently found widespread application across various industries. HFM is characterized by high machining speed, reduced cycle times, increased overall productivity, and increased tool life. Due to its versatility, HFM is a suitable technology for the application of various materials. The study deals with experimental analysis of cutting forces, machined surface integrity, and statistical evaluation in high-feed machining. In the present study, nickel-copper-based alloy (Monel) was chosen as the machined material, employing HFM with a monolithic ceramic milling cutter. The Monel material is characterized by its excellent mechanical properties and chemical resistance in harsh environments. During machining, cutting forces were recorded in three mutually perpendicular directions. This paper delves into the analysis of the impact of the depth of cut (ap), width of cut (ae), and lead-in angle (ε). The chosen evaluation characteristics encompass the tool load, primary profile, and the attained roughness of the machined surface. It is noteworthy that the technology under consideration predominantly aligns with the roughing phase of the manufacturing process. Additionally, the investigation incorporates a statistical analysis of the response surface pertaining to the cutting force components, namely Fx, Fy, Fz, and the resultant cutting force F.},

In this study, a multi-material additive manufacturing technique that employs a diode laser and the hot-wire method was developed for stainless steel/aluminum alloys. An Al-Mg aluminum alloy filler wire (JIS 5183-WY) was fed on an austenitic stainless-steel plate (JIS SUS304) while varying the laser power and process speed and using paste-type flux and flux-cored wire. The effects of laser power and process speed on phenomena during manufacturing and IMC formation were investigated. Finally, the wall-type multilayer specimens were fabricated under optimized conditions. The suppression of IMC formation to a thickness of less than 2 μm was achieved in the specimens, along with a high interfacial strength of over 120 MPa on average.},

ABSTRACT = {Image processing systems can be used to measure the accuracy of 3D-printed objects. These systems must compare images of the CAD model of the object to be printed with its 3D-printed counterparts to identify any discrepancies. Consequently, the integrity of the accuracy measurement process is heavily dependent on the image processing settings chosen. This study focuses on this issue by developing a customized image processing system. The system generates binary images of a given CAD model and its 3D-printed counterparts and then compares them pixel by pixel to determine the accuracy. Users can experiment with various image processing settings, such as grayscale to binary image conversion threshold, noise reduction parameters, masking parameters, and pixel-fineness adjustment parameters, to see how they affect accuracy. The study concludes that the grayscale to binary image conversion threshold has the most significant impact on accuracy and that the optimal threshold varies depending on the color of the 3D-printed object. The system can also effectively eliminate noise (filament marks) during image processing, ensuring accurate measurements. Additionally, the system can measure the accuracy of highly complex porous structures where the pore size, depth, and distribution are random. The insights gained from this study can be used to develop intelligent systems for the metrology of additive manufacturing.},

ABSTRACT = {Magnetic pulse welding (MPW) employs a strong pulsed magnetic field to accelerate parts against each other, thus forming an impact joint. Single-turn tool coils and field-shapers (FSs) used in MPW operate under the most demanding conditions, such as magnetic fields of 40–50 T with periods lasting tens of microseconds. With the use of conventional copper and bronze coils, intense thermo-mechanical stresses lead to the rapid degradation of the working bore. This work aimed to improve the efficiency of field-shapers and focused on the development of two- and four-slit FSs with a nanocomposite Cu 18Nb brazed wire acting as an inner current-carrying layer. The measured ratios of the magnetic field to the discharge current were 56.3 and 50.6 T/MA for the two- and four-slit FSs, respectively. FEM calculations of the magnetic field generated showed variations of 6–9% and 3% for the two- and four-slit FSs, respectively. The ovality percentages following copper tube compression were 27% and 7% for the two- and four-slit FSs, respectively. The measured deviations in the weld-joining length were 11% and 1.4% in the two- and four-slit FSs, respectively. Compared to the previous experiments on an entirely steel inductor, the novel FS showed significantly better results in terms of its efficiency and the homogeneity of its magnetic field.},

ABSTRACT = {Optimizing process parameters to minimize defects remains an important challenge in injection molding (IM). Machine learning (ML) techniques offer promise in this regard, but their application often requires extensive datasets. Transfer learning (TL) emerges as a solution to this problem, leveraging knowledge from related tasks to enhance model training and performance. This study explores TL’s viability in predicting weld line visibility in injection-molded components using artificial neural networks (ANNs). TL techniques are employed to transfer knowledge between datasets related to different components. Furthermore, both source datasets obtained from simulations and experimental tests are used during the study. In order to use process simulations to obtain data regarding the presence of surface defects, it was necessary to correlate an output variable of the simulations with the experimental observations. The results demonstrate TL’s efficacy in reducing the data required for training predictive models, with simulations proving to be a cost-effective alternative to experimental data. TL from simulations achieves comparable predictive metric values to those of the non-pre-trained network, but with an 83% reduction in the required data for the target dataset. Overall, transfer learning shows promise in streamlining injection molding optimization and reducing manufacturing costs.},

ABSTRACT = {Conventional path-planning strategies for GMA-WAAM may encounter challenges related to geometrical features when printing complex-shaped builds. One alternative to mitigate geometry-related flaws is to use algorithms that optimise trajectory choices—for instance, using heuristics to find the most efficient trajectory. The algorithm can assess several trajectory strategies, such as contour, zigzag, raster, and even space-filling, to search for the best strategy according to the case. However, handling complex geometries by this means poses computational efficiency concerns. This research aimed to explore the potential of machine learning techniques as a solution to increase the computational efficiency of such algorithms. First, reinforcement learning (RL) concepts are introduced and compared with supervised machining learning concepts. The Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) problem is explained and justified as a choice within the RL techniques. As a case study, a space-filling strategy was chosen to have this machining learning optimisation artifice in its algorithm for GMA-AM printing. Computational and experimental validations were conducted, demonstrating that adding MAB in the algorithm helped to achieve shorter trajectories, using fewer iterations than the original algorithm, potentially reducing printing time. These findings position the RL techniques, particularly MAB, as a promising machining learning solution to address setbacks in the space-filling strategy applied.},

ABSTRACT = {Knowing the tolerance interval capabilities (TICs) of a manufacturing process is of prime interest, especially if specifications link the manufacturer to a customer. These TICs can be determined using the machine performance concept of ISO 22514. However, few works have applied this to Additive Manufacturing printers, while testing most of the printing area as recommended takes a very long time (nearly 1 month is common). This paper, by proposing a novel part design called COMPAQT (Component for Machine Performances Assessment in Quick Time), aims at giving the same level of printing area coverage, while keeping the manufacturing time below 24 h. The method was successfully tested on a material extrusion printer. It allowed the determination of potential and real machine tolerance interval capabilities. Independently of the feature size, those aligned with the X axis achieved lower TICs than those aligned with the Y axis, while the Z axis exhibited the best performance. The measurements specific to one part exhibited a systematic error centered around 0 mm ± 0.050 mm, while those involving two parts reached up to 0.314 mm of deviation. COMPAQT can be used in two applications: evaluating printer tolerance interval capabilities and tracking its long-term performance by incorporating it into batches of other parts.},

ABSTRACT = {Powder deposition is a very important aspect of PBF-based additive manufacturing processes. Discrete Element Method (DEM) is commonly utilized by researchers to examine the physically complex aspects of powder-spreading methods. This work focuses on vibration-assisted doctor blade powder recoating. The aim of this work is to use experiment-verified DEM simulations in combination with Taguchi Design of Experiments (DoE) to identify optimum spreading parameters based on robust layer quality criteria. The verification of the used powder model is performed via angle of repose and angle of avalanche simulation–experiment cross-checking. Then, four criteria, namely layer thickness deviation, surface coverage ratio, surface root-mean-square roughness and true packing density, are defined. It has been proven that the doctor blade’s translational speed plays the most important role in defining the quality of the deposited layer. The true packing density was found to be unaffected by the spreading parameters. The vertical vibration of the doctor blade recoater was found to have a beneficial effect on the quality of the deposited layer. Ultimately, a weighted mean quality criteria analysis is mapped out. Skewness and kurtosis were proven to function as effective indicators of layer quality, showing a linear relation to the weighted means of the defined quality criteria. The specific weights that optimize this linearity were identified.},

ABSTRACT = {In traditional injection molding, each level of the process has its own monitoring and improvement initiatives. But in the upcoming industrial revolution, it is important to establish connections and communication among all stages, as changes in one stage might have an impact on others. To address this issue, digital twins (DTs) are introduced as virtual models that replicate the entire injection molding process. This paper focuses on the data and technology needed to build a DT model for injection molding. Each stage can have its own DT, which are integrated into a comprehensive model of the process. DTs enable the smart automation of production processes and data collection, reducing manual efforts in supervising and controlling production systems. However, implementing DTs is challenging and requires effort for conception and integration with the represented systems. To mitigate this, the current work presents a model for systematic knowledge-based engineering for the DTs of injection molding. This model includes fault detection systems, 3D printing, and system integration to automate development activities. Based on knowledge engineering, data analysis, and data mapping, the proposed DT model allows fault detection, prognostic maintenance, and predictive manufacturing.},

ABSTRACT = {Electron beam–powder bed fusion (PBF-EB) is an additive manufacturing process that utilizes an electron beam as the heat source to enable material fusion. However, the use of a charge-carrying heat source can sometimes result in sudden powder explosions, usually referred to as “Smoke”, which can lead to process instability or termination. This experimental study investigated the initiation and propagation of Smoke using in situ high-speed synchrotron radiography. The results reveal two key mechanisms for Smoke evolution. In the first step, the beam–powder bed interaction creates electrically isolated particles in the atmosphere. Subsequently, these isolated particles get charged either by direct irradiation by the beam or indirectly by back-scattered electrons. These particles are accelerated by electric repulsion, and new particles in the atmosphere are produced when they impinge on the powder bed. This is the onset of the avalanche process known as Smoke. Based on this understanding, the dependence of Smoke on process parameters such as beam returning time, beam diameter, etc., can be rationalized.},

ABSTRACT = {The multi-scale study of rock properties is a necessary step in the planning of oil and gas reservoir developments. The amount of core samples available for research is usually limited, and some of the samples can be distracted. The investigation of core reconstruction possibilities is an important task. An approach to the real-size reconstruction of porous media with a given (target) porosity and permeability by controlling the parameters of FFF 3D printing using CT images of the original core is proposed. Real-size synthetic core specimens based on CT images were manufactured using FFF 3D printing. The possibility of reconstructing the reservoir properties of a sandstone core sample was proven. The results of gas porometry measurements showed that the porosity of specimens No.32 and No.46 was 13.5% and 12.8%, and the permeability was 442.3 mD and 337.8 mD, respectively. The porosity of the original core was 14% and permeability was 271 mD. It was found that changing the layer height and nozzle diameter, as well as the retract and restart distances, has a direct effect on the porosity and permeability of synthetic specimens. This study shows that porosity and permeability of synthetic specimens depend on the flow of the material and the percentage of overlap between the infill and the outer wall.},

ABSTRACT = {Incremental sheet forming represents a relatively recent technology, similar to the layered manufacturing principle of the rapid prototype approach; it is very suitable for small series production and guarantees cost-effectiveness because it does not require dedicated equipment. Research has initially shown that this process is effective in metal materials capable of withstanding plastic deformation but, in recent years, the interest in this technique has been increasing for the manufacture of complex polymer sheet components as an alternative to the conventional technologies, based on heating–shaping–cooling manufacturing routes. Conversely, incrementally formed polymer sheets can suffer from some peculiar defects, like, for example, twisting. To reduce the risk of this phenomenon, the occurrence of failures and poor surface quality, a viable way is to choose toolpath strategies that make the tool/sheet contact conditions less severe; this represents one of the main goals of the present research. Polycarbonate sheets were worked using incremental forming; in detail, cone frusta with a fixed-wall angle were manufactured with different toolpaths based on a reference and a stair strategy, in lubricated and dry conditions. The forming forces, the forming time, the twist angle, and the mean roughness were monitored. The analysis of the results highlighted that a stair toolpath involving an alternation of diagonal up and vertical down steps represents a useful strategy to mitigate the occurrence of the twisting phenomenon in incremental formed thermoplastic sheets and a viable way of improving the process towards a green manufacturing process.},

ABSTRACT = {The influence of 3D printing parameters on compressive properties is an important factor in the application of additive manufacturing processes for products subjected to compressive loads in use. In this study, the compressive strength and compressive modulus of acrylonitrile/butadiene/styrene (ABS) test specimens fabricated using the fused deposition modeling (FDM) process were investigated with the aim of producing products of high-heeled shoes for women. The experimental part of the study includes a central composite experimental design to optimize the main 3D printing parameters (layer thickness, infill density, and extrusion temperature) and the infill geometry (honeycomb and linear at a 45° angle—L45) to achieve maximum printing properties of the 3D-printed products. The results show that the infill density has the greatest influence on the printing properties, followed by the layer thickness and, finally, the extrusion temperature as the least influential factor. The linear infill at a 45° angle resulted in higher compressive strength and lower compressive modulus values compared to the honeycomb infill. By optimizing the results, the maximum compressive strength (that of L45 is 41 N/mm2 and that of honeycomb 35 N/mm2) and modulus (that of L45 is 918 N/mm2 and that of honeycomb is 868 N/mm2) for both types of infill is obtained at a layer thickness of 0.1 mm and infill density of 40%, while the temperature for L45 can be in the range of 209 °C to 254 °C, but for the honeycomb infill, the processing temperature is 255 °C. Additionally, the study highlights the potential for sustainable manufacturing practices and the integration of advanced 3D printing technologies to enhance the efficiency and eco-friendliness of the production process.},

ABSTRACT = {Cutting simulations via the Finite Element Method (FEM) have recently gained more significance due to ever increasing computational performance and thus better resulting accuracy. However, these simulations are still time consuming and therefore cannot be deployed for an in situ evaluation of the machining processes in an industrial environment. This is due to the high non-linear nature of FEM simulations of machining processes, which require considerable computational resources. On the other hand, machine learning methods are known to capture complex non-linear behaviors. One of the most widely applied material models in cutting simulations is the Johnson–Cook material model, which has a great influence on the output of the cutting simulations and contributes to the non-linear behavior of the models, but its influence on cutting forces is sometimes difficult to assess beforehand. Therefore, this research aims to capture the highly non-linear behavior of the material model by using a dataset of multiple short-duration cutting simulations from Abaqus to learn the relationship of the Johnson–Cook material model parameters and the resulting cutting forces for a constant set of cutting conditions. The goal is to shorten the time to simulate cutting forces by encapsulating complex cutting conditions in dependence of material parameters in a single model. A total of five different models are trained and the performance is evaluated. The results show that Gradient Boosted Machines capture the influence of varying material model parameters the best and enable good predictions of cutting forces as well as deliver insights into the relevance of the material parameters for the cutting and thrust forces in orthogonal cutting.},

ABSTRACT = {In order to avoid catastrophic events that degrade the quality of machined products, such as tool breakage, it is vital to have a prognostic system for monitoring tool wear during the micro-milling process. Despite the long history of the tool wear monitoring field, creating such a system to track, monitor, and foresee the rapid progression of tool wear still needs to be improved in the application of micro-milling. On the other hand, digital twin technology has recently become widely recognized as significant in manufacturing and, notably, within the Industry 4.0 ecosystem. Digital twin technology is considered a potential breakthrough in developing a prognostic tool wear monitoring system, as it enables the tracking, monitoring, and prediction of the dynamics of a twinned object, e.g., a CNC machine tool. However, few works have explored the digital twin technology for tool wear monitoring, particularly in the micro-milling field. This paper presents a novel tool wear monitoring system for micro-milling machining based on digital twin technology and an extended Kalman filter framework. The proposed system provides wear progression notifications to assist the user in making decisions related to the machining process. In an evaluation using four machining datasets of slot micro-milling, the proposed system achieved a maximum error mean of 0.038 mm from the actual wear value. The proposed system brings a promising opportunity to widen the utilization of digital twin technology with the extended Kalman filter framework for seamless data integration for wear monitoring service.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper describes a sample partitioning approach to retain or reject samples from an initial distribution of stability maps using milling test results. The stability maps are calculated using distributions of uncertain modal parameters that represent the tool tip frequency response functions and cutting force model coefficients. Test points for sample partitioning are selected using either (1) the combination of spindle speed and mean axial depth from the available samples that provides the high material removal rate, or (2) a spindle speed based on the chatter frequency and mean axial depth at that spindle speed. The latter is selected when an unstable (chatter) result is obtained from a test. Because the stability model input parameters are also partitioned using the test results, their uncertainty is reduced using a limited number of tests and the milling stability model accuracy is increased. A case study is provided to evaluate the algorithm.},
