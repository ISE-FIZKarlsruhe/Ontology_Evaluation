ABSTRACT = {Prosumer (producing consumer)-based desktop additive manufacturing has been enabled by the recent radical reduction in 3-D printer capital costs created by the open-source release of the self-replicating rapid prototype (RepRap). To continue this success, there have been some efforts to improve reliability, which are either too expensive or lacked automation. A promising method to improve reliability is to use computer vision, although the success rates are still too low for widespread use. To overcome these challenges an open source low-cost reliable real-time optimal monitoring platform for 3-D printing from double cameras is presented here. This error detection system is implemented with low-cost web cameras and covers 360 degrees around the printed object from three different perspectives. The algorithm is developed in Python and run on a Raspberry Pi3 mini-computer to reduce costs. For 3-D printing monitoring in three different perspectives, the systems are tested with four different 3-D object geometries for normal operation and failure modes. This system is tested with two different techniques in the image pre-processing step: SIFT and RANSAC rescale and rectification, and non-rescale and rectification. The error calculations were determined from the horizontal and vertical magnitude methods of 3-D reconstruction images. The non-rescale and rectification technique successfully detects the normal printing and failure state for all models with 100% accuracy, which is better than the single camera set up only. The computation time of the non-rescale and rectification technique is two times faster than the SIFT and RANSAC rescale and rectification technique.},

ABSTRACT = {Direct Metal Deposition (DMD) is an additive manufacturing (AM) process capable of producing large components using a layer by layer deposition of molten powder. DMD is increasingly investigated due to its higher deposition rate and the possibility to produce large structural components specifically for the aerospace industry. During fabrication, a complex thermal history is experienced in different regions of the workpiece, depending on the process parameters and part geometry. The thermal history induces residual stress accumulation in the buildup, which is the main cause of distortions. In order to control the process and enhance the product quality, the understanding of the workpiece temperature is substantial. In this study, two methods to predict temperature evolution during the DMD process are introduced based on analytical and finite element methods. The objective is to compare these methods to experimental results and to provide more insights about their capabilities to predict accurately the temperature gradient, the cooling rate, and the melt pool geometry. A comparison of the computational time is also provided. Based on the results of the investigation, It appears that the analytical method provides an effective and accurate method to understand the influence of the process on the workpiece temperature.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper presents a new numerical approach for modelling the 3D printing process of fibre reinforced polymer composites by fused deposition modelling (FDM). The approach is based on the coupling between two particle methods, namely smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) and discrete element method (DEM). The coupled SPH-DEM model has distinctive advantages in dealing with the free surface flow, large deformation of fibres, and/or fibre-fibre interaction that are involved in the FDM process. A numerical feasibility study is carried out to demonstrate its capability for both short and continuous fibre reinforced polymer composites, with promising results achieved for the rheological flow and fibre orientation and deformation.},

ABSTRACT = {The main aim of this work was to evaluate the influence and optimize the factors of the TIG-MIG/MAG hybrid welding process on the geometry of the weld bead. An experimental design using the Taguchi methodology (robust design method) was used to conduct the experiments. The experiments were carried out according to an orthogonal matrix with 27 experiments, with three replicates each, totaling 81 test specimens. The factors (MIG/MAG shielding gas type, MIG/MAG voltage, MIG/MAG wire feed, gas flow rate of TIG, electric current intensity of TIG and welding speed) were varied with three levels each. Penetration, heat-affected zone (HAZ), bead width and bead height were the response variables analyzed. The results showed that the penetration was significantly influenced by the MIG/MAG wire feed, MIG/MAG shielding gas type, MIG/MAG voltage and welding speed. The HAZ has been influenced by MIG/MAG voltage, MIG/MAG shielding gas type, welding speed and electric current intensity of TIG. All factors had effects on the width, except the MIG/MAG wire feed. The bead height was significantly influenced by the MIG/MAG wire feed and by the electric current intensity of TIG. Optimizing the process was performed, so that for each output variable, the values of the factors that should be used were indicated, and the optimization was confirmed by welding test specimens.},

ABSTRACT = {In the present study, the mesostructure of a fused deposition modeling (FDM) processed part is considered for the investigation of its mechanical behavior. The layers of FDM printed part behave as a unidirectional fiber reinforced laminae, which are treated as an orthotropic material. The finite element (FE) procedure to find elastic moduli of a layer of the FDM processed part is presented. The mesostructure of the part that would be obtained from the process is replicated in FE models in order to find stiffness matrix of a layer. Two distinctive architectures of mesostructure are considered in the study to predict the mechanical behavior of the parts. Also, influences of layer thickness, road shape and air gap on the elastic properties of a material are investigated. Further, the parts fabricated with FDM process are treated as laminate structures. From the numerical results, it is seen that the elastic moduli are governed by mesostructures. Our laminate results are validated with experimental to demonstrate the use of classical laminate theory (CLT) for FDM parts. The elastic moduli (E1, E2, G12, ν12) of a layer used in the analysis are calculated from FE simulations. This study establishes relationship between mesostructure and macro mechanical properties of the part.},

ABSTRACT = {The laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) technology was adapted for use with non-spherical low-cost water-atomized iron powders. A simplified numerical and experimental modeling approach was applied to determine—in a first approximation—the operation window for the selected powder in terms of laser power, scanning speed, hatching space, and layer thickness. The operation window, delimited by a build rate ranging from 4 to 25 cm3/h, and a volumetric energy density ranging from 50 to 190 J/mm3, was subsequently optimized to improve the density, the mechanical properties, and the surface roughness of the manufactured specimens. Standard L-PBF-built specimens were subjected to microstructural (porosity, grain size) and metrological (accuracy, shrinkage, minimum wall thickness, surface roughness) analyses and mechanical testing (three-point bending and tensile tests). The results of the microstructural, metrological and mechanical characterizations of the L-PBF-built specimens subjected to stress relieve annealing and hot isostatic pressing were then compared with those obtained with conventional pressing-sintering technology. Finally, by using an energy density of 70 J/mm3 and a build rate of 9 cm3/h, it was possible to manufacture 99.8%-dense specimens with an ultimate strength of 330 MPa and an elongation to failure of 30%, despite the relatively poor circularity of the powder used.},

ABSTRACT = {Polymer optics are widely used in various applications, replacing traditional glass lenses. The ability to create free-form and micro-structured optics, as well as fast replication, gives them major advantages over traditional glass lenses. However, the fabrication of complex optical components requires full process control and understanding of influencing factors on the quality of the polymer optical parts. In this work, a curved diffractive optical element (DOE) is fabricated using injection compression molding. Different gate designs were evaluated and the movement of the compression stamper was optimized to obtain good filling behavior. The process stability was analyzed and improved by controlling the melt temperature precisely. Finally, the molding parameters were optimized, focusing on the mold temperature, melt temperature and compression force. Curved diffractive optical elements were replicated with feature sizes of 1.6 μm. The experiments showed that all aspects of the molding process have to be controlled perfectly to produce complex polymer optics. High mold temperatures and compression force are necessary to replicate micro-structured features. The work presents a broad investigation and description of the fabrication process and their influences.},

ABSTRACT = {The question, how certain surface layer properties (for example, hardness or roughness) can be specifically influenced in different manufacturing processes, is of great economic interest. A prerequisite for the investigation of the formation of surface layer properties is the metrological assessment of the material stresses during processing. Up to now, no commercial in-process measuring system exists, which is able to determine material stresses in the form of mechanical strains in high-dynamic manufacturing processes with sufficient accuracy. A detailed analysis of the resolution limits shows that speckle photography enables deformation measurements with a resolution in the single-digit nanometer range. Thus, speckle photography basically offers the potential to measure material stresses during processing. Using the example of single-tooth milling, the applicability of speckle photography for in-process stress measurements is demonstrated. Even in such highly dynamic manufacturing processes with cutting speeds up to 10 m/s, the absolute measurement uncertainty of the strain is less than 0.05%. This is more than one order of magnitude lower than the occurring maximal strain. Therefore, speckle photography is suitable for characterizing the dynamic stresses and the material deformations in manufacturing processes.},

ABSTRACT = {One of the most essential components of the fused deposition modeling (FDM) additive manufacturing (AM) process is the build plate, the surface upon which the part is constructed. These are typically made from aluminum or glass, but there are clear disadvantages to both and restrictions on which materials can be processed on them successfully. This study examined the suitability of heated aluminum-polycarbonate (AL-PC) composite print beds for FDM, looking particularly at the mechanical properties, thermal behavior, deformation behavior, bonding strength with deposited material, printing quality, and range of material usability. Theoretical examination and physical experiments were performed for each of these areas; the results were compared to similar experiments done using heated aluminum and aluminum-glass print beds. Ten distinct materials (ABS, PLA, PET, HIPS, PC, TPU, PVA, nylon, metal PLA, and carbon-fiber PLA) were tested for printing performance. The use of a heated AL-PC print bed was found to be a practical option for most of the materials, particularly ABS and TPU, which are often challenging to process using traditional print bed types. Generally, the results were found to be equivalent to or superior to tempered glass and superior to standard aluminum build plates in terms of printing capability.},

ABSTRACT = {Due to their high ductility, high durability, and excellent corrosion resistance, stainless steels are attractive materials for a variety of applications. However, high work hardening, low thermal conductivity, and high built-up edge (BUE) formation make these materials difficult to machine. Rapid tool wear and high cutting forces are the common problems encountered while machining these materials. In the present work, the application of Taguchi optimization methodology has been used to optimize the cutting parameters of the drilling process for machining two stainless steels: austenitic AISI 304 and duplex AISI 2205 under dry conditions. The machining parameters which were chosen to be evaluated in this study are the tool material, cutting speed, and feed rate, while, the response factors to be measured are the tool life (T), cutting force (Fc), and specific cutting energy (ks). Additionally, empirical models were created for predicting the T, Fc and ks using linear regression analysis. The results of this study show that AISI 2205 stainless steel has a shorter tool life, a higher cutting force, and a higher specific cutting energy than AISI 304 stainless steel. In addition, the Taguchi method determined that A3B1C1 and A3B3C1 (A3 = TiN-coated twist drill, B1 = 13 m/min, B3 = 34 m/min, C1 = 0.12 mm/rev) are the optimized combination of levels for the best tool life and the lowest cutting force, respectively. Meanwhile, the optimized combination of levels for all three control factors from the analysis, which provides the lowest specific cutting energy, was found to be A3B1C3 (A3 = TiN-coated twist drill, B1 = 13 m/min, C3 = 0.32 mm/rev) for both stainless steels.},

ABSTRACT = {Additive manufacturing (AM) of soft materials has a wide variety of applications, such as customized or wearable devices. Silicone is one popular material for these applications given its favorable material properties. However, AM of silicone parts with overhang structures remains challenging due to the soft nature of the material. Overhang structures are the areas where there is no underlying structure. Typically, a support material is used and built in the underlying space so that the overhang structures can be built upon it. Currently, there is no support structure that has been used for AM of silicone. The goal of this study is to develop an AM process to fabricate silicone parts with overhang structures. We first identified and confirmed poly-vinyl alcohol (PVA), a water-soluble material, as a suitable support material for silicone by evaluating the adhesion strength between silicone and PVA. Process parameters for the support material, including critical overhang angle and minimum infill density for the support material, are identified. However, overhang angle alone is not the only determining factor for support material. As silicone is a soft material, it deflects due to its own weight when the height of the overhang structure increases. A finite element model is developed to estimate the critical overhang height paired with different overhang angles to determine whether the use of support material is needed. Finally, parts with overhang structures are printed to demonstrate the capability of the developed process.},

ABSTRACT = {High-speed machining (HSM) is used in industry to improve the productivity and quality of the cutting operations. In this investigation, pure alumina ceramics with the addition of ZrO2, and mixed alumina (Al2O3 + TiC) tools were used in the dry hard turning of AISI 4340 (52 HRC) at different high cutting speeds of 150, 250, 700 and 1000 m/min. It was observed that at cutting speeds of 150 and 250 m/min, pure alumina ceramic tools had better wear resistance than mixed alumina ones. However, upon increasing the cutting speed from 700 to 1000 m/min, mixed alumina ceramic tools outperformed pure ceramic ones. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were used to investigate the worn cutting edges and analyze the obtained results. It was found that the tribo-films formed at the cutting zone during machining affected the wear resistances of the tools and influenced the coefficient of friction at the tool-chip interface. These observations were confirmed by the chip compression ratio results at different cutting conditions. Raising cutting speed to 1000 m/min corresponded to a remarkable decrease in cutting force components in the dry hard turning of AISI 4340 steel.},

ABSTRACT = {In this work, the microstructure, texture, phases, and microhardness of 45° printed (with respect to the build direction) homogenized, and hot isostatically pressed (HIP) cylindrical IN718 specimens are investigated. Phase morphology, grain size, microhardness, and crystallographic texture at the bottom of each specimen differ from those of the top due to changes in cooling rate. High cooling rates during the printing process generated a columnar grain structure parallel to the building direction in the as-printed condition with a texture transition from (001) orientation at the bottom of the specimen to (111) orientation towards the specimen top based on EBSD analysis. A mixed columnar and equiaxed grain structure associated with about a 15% reduction in texture is achieved after homogenization treatment. HIP treatment caused significant grain coarsening, and engendered equiaxed grains with an average diameter of 154.8 µm. These treatments promoted the growth of δ-phase (Ni3Nb) and MC-type brittle (Ti, Nb)C carbides at grain boundaries. Laves phase (Fe2Nb) was also observed in the as-printed and homogenized specimens. Ostwald ripening of (Ti, Nb)C carbides caused excessive grain growth at the bottom of the HIPed IN718 specimens, while smaller grains were observed at their top. Microhardness in the as-fabricated specimens was 236.9 HV and increased in the homogenized specimens by 19.3% to 282.6 HV due to more even distribution of secondary precipitates, and the nucleation of smaller grains. A 36.1% reduction in microhardness to 180.5 HV was found in the HIPed condition due to   γ ″ phase dissolution and differences in grain morphology.},

ABSTRACT = {This experimental study focuses on various cooling strategies and lubrication-assisted cooling strategies to improve machining performance in the turning process of AISI 4140 steel. Liquid nitrogen (LN2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) were used as cryogenic coolants, and their performances were compared with respect to progression of tool wear. Minimum quantity lubrication (MQL) was also used with carbon dioxide. Progression of wear, including flank and nose, are the main outputs examined during experimental study. This study illustrates that carbon dioxide-assisted cryogenic machining alone and with minimum quantity lubrication does not contribute to decreasing the progression of wear within selected cutting conditions. This study also showed that carbon dioxide-assisted cryogenic machining helps to increase chip breakability. Liquid nitrogen-assisted cryogenic machining results in a reduction of tool wear, including flank and nose wear, in the machining process of AISI 4140 steel material. It was also observed that in the machining process of this material at a cutting speed of 80 m/min, built-up edges occurred in both cryogenic cooling conditions. Additionally, chip flow damage occurs in particularly dry machining.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, water quenching of large ingots was simulated using FORGE NxT 1.1® Finite Element code. Simulations were carried out for as-forged medium-carbon low-alloy steel. A novel method is proposed to simulate the different parts of a large size forged block with different chemical compositions and grain sizes using the multiple materials method. The effects of macrosegregation, grain size variation and cooling rate on phase distribution through the volume of the forged block were investigated. The delay in transformation kinetics, which is due to the effect of grain size variation and carbon content, was analyzed. Results show that macrosegregation and grain size variations significantly influence transformation start points and the volume fraction of phases that are present in each location of the forged ingot. The proposed prediction method was validated using high-resolution dilatometry experiments and X-ray diffraction measurements to evaluate accurately the volume fraction of martensite, bainite and the percentage of retained austenite for each condition.},

ABSTRACT = {This research work aims at finding the optimum process parameters for the laser welding of AA7020 aluminium alloys. The use of 7xxx series alloys is limited because of weldability problems, such as hot cracking, porosity, and softening of the fusion zone despite its higher specific strength-to-weight ratio. AA7020 aluminium alloy was welded while varying the process parameters so as to obtain optimal welding efficiency. The welded samples were analysed to reveal the microstructure, defects, and mechanical properties of the welded zone. The samples were prepared from a plate of AA7020, which was hot rolled at a temperature of 470 °С to a thickness of 1 mm. The welding was carried out at an overlap of 0.25 mm, duration of 14 ms and argon shield gas flow rate of 15 L/min. Process parameters, such as peak power, welding speed, and pulse shaping, were varied. The samples were welded with Al-5Ti-B and Al-5Mg as filler metals. The welding speed, peak power, and pulse shaping have a great influence on the weldability and hot cracking susceptibility of the aluminium alloy. Al-5Ti-B improves the microstructure and ultimate tensile strength of AA7020 aluminium alloy.},

ABSTRACT = {Among additive manufacturing (AM) techniques, Selective Laser Melting (SLM) is widely used to fabricate metal components, including biocompatible bone implants made of 316L stainless steel. However, an issue with the components manufactured using this technique is the surface quality, which is generally beyond the acceptable range. Thus, hybrid manufacturing, including AM and finish machining processes, are being developed and implemented in the industry. Machining processes, particularly finish machining, are needed to improve surface quality of additively manufactured components and performance. This study focuses on the finish machining process of additively manufactured 316L stainless steel parts. Finish machining tests were carried out under dry conditions for various cutting speeds and feed rates. The experimental study reveals that finish machining resulted in up to 88% lower surface roughness of SLMed 316L stainless steel; it also had a substantial effect on microstructure and microhardness of the additively manufactured components by creating smaller grains and strain-hardened layer on the surface and subsurface of the SLMed part. The finish machining process also significantly decreased the density of porosity on the surface and subsurface, compared to an as-built sample. The created strain harden layer with less porosity is expected to increases wear and fatigue resistance of these parts.},

Currently, temperature distribution is commonly investigated using arduous experiments, computationally inefficient numerical analyses, and complex analytical models. In the method proposed herein, the average temperatures at the primary shear zone (PSZ) and the secondary shear zone (SSZ) were determined for various materials, based on a constitutive model and a chip-formation model using measurements of cutting force and chip thickness. The temperatures were determined when differences between predicted shear stresses using the Johnson–Cook constitutive model (J–C model) and those using a chip-formation model were minimal. J–C model constants from split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) tests were adopted from the literature. Cutting conditions, experimental cutting force, and chip thickness were used to predict the shear stresses. The temperature predictions were compared to documented results in the literature for AISI 1045 steel and Al 6082-T6 aluminum in multiple tests in an effort to validate this methodology. Good agreement was observed for the tests with each material. Thanks to the reliable and easily measurable cutting forces and chip thicknesses, and the simple forms of the employed models, the presented methodology has less experimental complexity, less mathematical complexity, and high computational efficiency.},

ABSTRACT = {The additive manufacturing (AM) of aluminum alloys promises to considerably enhance the performance of lightweight critical parts in various industrial applications. AlSi10Mg is one of the compatible Al alloys used in the selective laser melting of lightweight components. However, the surface defects obtained from the as-built parts affect their mechanical properties, and thus represent an obstacle to using them as final products. This study aims to improve the surface characteristics of the as-built AlSi10Mg parts using shot peening (SP). To achieve this goal, different SP intensities were applied to various surface textures of the as-built samples. The SP results showed a significant improvement in the as-built surface topography and a higher value of effective depth using 22.9 A intensity and Gp165 glass beads. The area near the shot-peened surface showed a significant microstructure refinement to a specific depth due to the dynamic precipitation of nanoscale Si particles. Surface hardening was also detected and high compressive residual stresses were generated due to severe plastic deformation. The surface characteristics obtained after SP could result in a significant improvement in the mechanical properties and fatigue strength, and thus promise performance enhancement for critical parts in various industrial applications.},

ABSTRACT = {In order to improve the finishing efficiency of traditional plane magnetic abrasive finishing (MAF), we have previously proposed an effective plane MAF process combined with an electrolytic process and developed a special compound machining tool for the electrolytic magnetic abrasive finishing (EMAF). In this research, the EMAF process is divided into two finishing steps. The first finishing step is the EMAF step, and a single MAF step constitutes the second finishing step. The machinability of SUS304 material can be improved through the formation of passive films from the electrolytic process in the EMAF step. Meanwhile, the passive films can be rapidly and easily removed by friction between the magnetic particles and the workpiece-generated mechanical machining force. Thus, the surface finishing efficiency can be greatly improved. Compared with a dedicated MAF machining tool or a dedicated electrolytic machining tool, this special compound machining tool can synchronously achieve MAF and electrolytic processes to make the processing more convenient. This study focuses on exploring mechanical finishing characteristics of the special compound machining tool through MAF experiments. Additionally, EMAF experiments are conducted under the optimal mechanical finishing conditions. The experimental results of the EMAF process show that the surface roughness Ra can be reduced to less than 30 nm at the 4-min EMAF step, and it can be further reduced to 20 nm at the 10-min MAF step.},

ABSTRACT = {A low-cost parametric finite element thermal model is proposed to study the impact of the initial powder condition, such as diameter and packing density, on effective thermal conductivity as well as the impact of the laser power input on the final temperature distributions during selective laser melting (SLM). Stainless steel 304L is the material used, since it is not yet commercially available in SLM equipment and our main goal was to show the capabilities of the finite element method in the evaluation of power input in the process. The results from our sensitivity analysis showed that packing density has a greater impact on the final temperature distributions compared with powder diameter variance. However, overall the thermal conductivity of the powder only showed significant effects below the melting point, otherwise the thermal conductivity no longer affected the temperature distributions. Among the three different power inputs analyzed, the temperature profile demonstrated that power inputs of 100 and 200 W are recommended when printing SS-304L rather than 400 W, which generates too high temperature in the powder bed, a non-favorable behavior that can induce high residual stresses and material evaporation.},

ABSTRACT = {Difficult-to-cut materials have been widely employed in many engineering applications, including automotive and aeronautical designs because of their effective properties. However, other characteristics; for example, high hardness and low thermal conductivity has negatively affected the induced surface quality and tool life, and consequently the overall machinability of such materials. Inconel 718, is widely used in many industries including aerospace; however, the high temperature generated during machining is negatively affecting its machinability. Flood cooling is a commonly used remedy to improve machinability problems; however, government regulation has called for further alternatives to reduce the environmental and health impacts of flood cooling. This work aimed to investigate the influence of dispersed multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and aluminum oxide (Al2O3) gamma nanoparticles, on enhancing the minimum quantity lubrication (MQL) technique cooling and lubrication capabilities during turning of Inconel 718. Machining tests were conducted, the generated surfaces were examined, and the energy consumption data were recorded. The study was conducted under different design variables including cutting speed, percentage of added nano-additives (wt.%), and feed velocity. The study revealed that the nano-fluids usage, generally improved the machining performance when cutting Inconel 718. In addition, it was shown that the nanotubes additives provided better improvements than Al2O3 nanoparticles.},

ABSTRACT = {Laser Cladding is one of the leading processes within Additive Manufacturing technologies, which has concentrated a considerable amount of effort on its development. In regard to the latter, the current study aims to summarize the influence of the most relevant process parameters in the laser cladding processing of single and compound volumes (solid forms) made from AISI 316L stainless steel powders and using a coaxial nozzle for their deposition. Process speed, applied laser power and powder flow are considered to be the main variables affecting the laser cladding in single clads, whereas overlap percentage and overlapping strategy also become relevant when dealing with multiple clads. By setting appropriate values for each process parameter, the main goal of this paper is to develop a processing window in which a good metallurgical bond between the delivered powder and the substrate is obtained, trying simultaneously to maintain processing times at their lowest value possible. Conventional metallography techniques were performed on the cross sections of the laser tracks to measure the effective dimensions of clads, height and width, as well as the resulting dilution value. Besides the influence of the overlap between contiguous clads and layers, physical defects such as porosity and cracks were also evaluated. Optimum process parameters to maximize productivity were defined as 13 mm/s, 2500 W, 30% of overlap and a 25 g/min powder feed rate.},

ABSTRACT = {Laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) is one of the most potent additive manufacturing (AM) processes. Metallic LPBF is gaining popularity, but one of the obstacles facing its larger industrial use is the limited knowledge of its dimensional and geometrical performances. This paper presents a metrological investigation of the geometrical and dimensional deviations of a selected LPBF-manufactured component, according to the ASME Y14.5-2009 standard. This approach allows for an estimation of both the process capability, as per ISO 22514-4 standard, and the correlations between the part location in the manufacturing chamber and the profile deviations. Forty-nine parts, which are representative of a typical aerospace tooling component (30 mm in diameter and 27.2 mm in height) were manufactured from AlSi10Mg powder using an EOSINT M280 printer and subjected to a stress relief annealing at 300 °C for two hours. This manufacturing procedure was repeated three times. A complete statistical analysis was carried out and the results of the investigation show that LPBF performances for all geometrical variations of 147 identical parts fall within a range of 230 µm at a 99.73% level.},

ABSTRACT = {The ability to produce consistent material properties across a single or series of platforms, particularly over time, is the major objective in metal additive manufacturing (MAM) research. If this can be achieved, it will result in widespread adoption of the technology for industry and place it into mainstream manufacturing. However, before this can happen, it is critical to develop an understanding of how processing parameters influence the thermal conditions which dictate the mechanical properties of MAM builds. Research work reported in the literature of MAM is generally based on a set of parameters and/or the review of a few parameter changes, and observing the effects that these changes (i.e., microstructure, mechanical properties) have. While these articles provide results with some insight, there lacks a standard approach that can be used to allow meaningful comparisons and conclusions to be made concerning the optimization of the processing variables. This study provides a template which can be used for making comparisons across DED platforms. The tests are performed with a design of experiments (DOE) philosophy directed to evaluate the effect of selected parameters on the measured properties of the DED builds. Specifically, a laser engineering net shaping system (LENS) is used to build multilayered 316L coupons and analyze how build parameters such as laser power, travel speed, and powder feed rate influence the thermal conditions that will define both microstructure and microhardness. A fundamental conclusion of this research is that it is possible to repeatedly obtain a consistent microstructure that contains a fine cellular substructure with a low level of porosity (less than 1.1%) and with microhardness that is equal to or better than wrought 316L. This is mainly achieved by maintaining an associated powder flow to travel speed ratio at the power level, ensuring an appropriate net heat input for the build process.},

ABSTRACT = {A physics-based analytical model is proposed in order to predict the temperature profile during metal additive manufacturing (AM) processes, by considering the effects of temperature history in each layer, temperature-sensitivity of material properties and latent heat. The moving heat source analysis is used in order to predict the temperature distribution inside a semi-infinite solid material. The laser thermal energy deposited into a control volume is absorbed by the material thermodynamic latent heat and conducted through the contacting solid boundaries. The analytical model takes in to account the typical multi-layer aspect of additive manufacturing processes for the first time. The modeling of the problem involving multiple layers is of great importance because the thermal interactions of successive layers affect the temperature gradients, which govern the heat transfer and thermal stress development mechanisms. The temperature profile is calculated for isotropic and homogeneous material. The proposed model can be used to predict the temperature in laser-based metal additive manufacturing configurations of either direct metal deposition or selective laser melting. A numerical analysis is also conducted to simulate the temperature profile in metal AM. These two models are compared with experimental results. The proposed model also well captured the melt pool geometry as it is compared to experimental values. In order to emphasize the importance of solving the problem considering multiple layers, the peak temperature considering the layer addition and peak temperature not considering the layer addition are compared. The results show that considering the layer addition aspect of metal additive manufacturing can help to better predict the surface temperature and melt pool geometry. An analysis is conducted to show the importance of considering the temperature sensitivity of material properties in predicting temperature. A comparison of the computational time is also provided for analytical and numerical modeling. Based on the obtained results, it appears that the proposed analytical method provides an effective and accurate method to predict the temperature in metal AM.},

The samples built in the Z orientation showed weaker tensile strength compared to the samples built in X, and Y orientations. Samples built in X and Y orientations exhibited brittle fracture features in areas close to the substrate and ductile fracture features in the area farther from the substrate. Defects including pores, cracks, and unmelted/partially-melted powder particles contributed to lower tensile and fracture toughness properties in different orientations.},

ABSTRACT = {The new generation of ICT solutions applied to the monitoring, adaptation, simulation and optimisation of factories are key enabling technologies for a new level of manufacturing capability and adaptability in the context of Industry 4.0. Given the advances in sensor technologies, factories, as well as machine tools can now be sensorised, and the vast amount of data generated can be exploited by intelligent information processing techniques such as machine learning. This paper presents an online tool wear classification system built in terms of a monitoring infrastructure, dedicated to perform dry milling on steel while capturing force signals, and a computing architecture, assembled for the assessment of the flank wear based on deep learning. In particular, this approach demonstrates that a big data analytics method for classification applied to large volumes of continuously-acquired force signals generated at high speed during milling responds sufficiently well when used as an indicator of the different stages of tool wear. This research presents the design, development and deployment of the system components and an overall evaluation that involves machining experiments, data collection, training and validation, which, as a whole, has shown an accuracy of 78%.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper evaluates a physics-based analytical model in the prediction of machining temperature of AISI 1045 steel and AISI 4340 steel. The prediction model was developed based on the Johnson-Cook constitutive model (J-C model) and mechanics of the orthogonal cutting process. The average temperatures at two shear zones were predicted by minimizing the difference between calculated stresses using the J-C model and calculated stresses using the mechanics model. In this work, (1) the influence of input Johnson-Cook model constants, cutting force, and chip thickness on the accuracy of predictions are investigated with sensitivity analyses, in which multiple sets of available J-C constants and varying cutting force and chip thickness are used for the temperature prediction in machining AISI 1045 steel. The larger the input deviation, the larger prediction deviation. The temperature at the primary shear zone is more susceptible to the deviation of inputs than the temperature at the secondary shear zone. (2) The machining temperatures are also predicted in machining AISI 4340 steel using cutting tools with various specifications to demonstrate its predictive capability. Good agreements are observed upon validation to available experimental data in the literature. (3) Lastly, the advantage and limitation of the temperature model are discussed with comparison other analytical temperature models. Considering the reliable and easily measurable input requirements and sufficient predictive capability, this temperature model can be employed for effective and efficient machining temperature prediction.},

ABSTRACT = {It was found that the ultrasonic spot welding may serve as an efficient method to join relative large thin-walled parts made of fiber-reinforced thermoplastics. In this study, a new control method for the ultrasonic spot-welding process was investigated. It was found that, when welding fiber-reinforced thermoplastic laminates without energy directors, overheating and decomposition of the polymer at the weld spot occurred. The occurrence of the overheating took place at unpredictable times during welding. It was observed that the time trace of the consumed power curve by the welder follows a similar pattern as the time trace of the temperature in the weld spot center. Based on this observation, a control system was developed. The time derivative of the welder power was monitored in real time and, as soon as it exceeded a critical value, the ultrasonic vibration amplitude was actively adjusted through a microcontroller. The controlling of the ultrasonic welding process forced the temperature in the weld spot to remain in an adequate range throughout the welding duration for the polymer diffusion to occur. The results of the controlled welding process were evaluated by means of weld temperature measurements, computed tomography scans, and microscopic analysis of the weld spot fracture surfaces.},

ABSTRACT = {In the one-step manufacturing process for fiber metal laminate parts, the so-called in situ hybridization process, the fabrics are interacting with metal blanks. During deep drawing, the liquid matrix is injected between the metal sheets through the woven fiber layers. The metal blanks can be in contact with dry or with infiltrated fibers. The formability of the blanks is influenced by the variation of the starting time of injection. The reason for that is that, due to high contact forces, the fibers are able to deform the metal surface locally, so that movement and the strain of the blanks is inhibited. To investigate the influence of different fibers on the formability of metals, Nakazima tests are performed. In these tests, two metal blanks are formed with an interlayer of fibers. The results are compared with the formability of two blanks without any interlayer. It is shown that in with fibers between sheets, the formability decreases compared to the formability of two metal blanks without interlayers. Based on a simplified numerical model for different types of fibers, the interactions of the fibers with the metal blank are analyzed. It could be shown that the friction due to contact has more influence than the friction due to the form fit caused by the imprints.},

ABSTRACT = {In minimum quantity lubrication (MQL), an aerosol containing a minimum amount of the cutting fluid is delivered to the tool/workpiece interface during the metal cutting operation. The fluid lubrication by the fluid and the cooling by the compressed air in the aerosol improves the cutting process, while the low consumption rate in MQL provides less cleanup and reduces the associated cost. In this paper, molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) nanoparticles were added to the aerosol for providing a third functionality to the MQL, which is solid lubrication at the interface. Both orbital drilling and tribological testing using a four-ball tester were studied to examine the effectiveness of solid lubrication in MQL. In orbital drilling of titanium with tungsten carbide tools, MQL with nanofluids containing MoS2 nanoparticles resulted in less transfer film buildup on the tool. In four-ball testing, MQL with nanofluids with MoS2 and hBN nanoparticles yielded lower surface temperatures and less variation of frictional torques in titanium.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, a new method was introduced for feature extraction and fault diagnosis in bearings based on wavelet packet decomposition and analysis of the energy in different frequency bands. This method decomposes a signal into different frequency bands using different types of wavelets and performs multi-resolution analysis to extract different features of the signals by choosing energy levels in different frequency bands. The support vector machines (SVM) technique was used for faults classifications. Daubechies, biorthogonal, coiflet, symlet, Meyer, and reverse Meyer wavelets were used for feature extraction. The most appropriate decomposition level and frequency band were selected by analyzing the variation in the signal’s energy level. The proposed approach was applied to the fault diagnosis of rolling bearings, and testing results showed that the proposed approach can reliably identify different fault categories and their severities. Moreover, the effectiveness of the proposed feature selection and fault diagnosis method was significant based on the similarity between the wavelet packet and the signal, and effectively reduced the influence of the signal noise on the classification results.},

ABSTRACT = {This study shows the effect of hot isostatic pressing (HIP) on the porosity and the microstructure, as well as the corresponding fatigue strength of selectively-laser-melted (SLM) AlSi10Mg structures. To eliminate the influence of the as-built surface, all specimens are machined and exhibit a polished surface. To highlight the effect of the HIP treatment, the HIP specimens are compared to a test series without any post-treatment. The fatigue characteristic is evaluated by tension-compression high cycle fatigue tests under a load stress ratio of R = −1. The influence of HIP on the microstructural characteristics is investigated by utilizing scanning electron microscopy of micrographs of selected samples. In order to study the failure mechanism and the fatigue crack origin, a fracture surface analysis is carried out. It is found that, due to the HIP process and subsequent annealing, there is a beneficial effect on the microstructure regarding the fatigue crack propagation, such as Fe-rich precipitates and silicon agglomerations. This leads, combined with a significant reduction of global porosity and a decrease of micro pore sizes, to an improved fatigue resistance for the HIPed condition compared to the other test series within this study.},

ABSTRACT = {A simplified analytical model of the laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) process was used to develop a novel density prediction approach that can be adapted for any given powder feedstock and LPBF system. First, calibration coupons were built using IN625, Ti64 and Fe powders and a specific LPBF system. These coupons were manufactured using the predetermined ranges of laser power, scanning speed, hatching space, and layer thickness, and their densities were measured using conventional material characterization techniques. Next, a simplified melt pool model was used to calculate the melt pool dimensions for the selected sets of printing parameters. Both sets of data were then combined to predict the density of printed parts. This approach was additionally validated using the literature data on AlSi10Mg and 316L alloys, thus demonstrating that it can reliably be used to optimize the laser powder bed metal fusion process.},

ABSTRACT = {With the dramatic increment of complexity, more microfluidic devices require 3D structures, such as multi-depth and -layer channels. The traditional multi-step photolithography is time-consuming and labor-intensive and also requires precise alignment during the fabrication of microfluidic devices. Here, we present an inexpensive, single-step, and rapid fabrication method for multi-depth microfluidic devices using a high-resolution liquid crystal display (LCD) stereolithographic (SLA) three-dimensional (3D) printing system. With the pixel size down to 47.25 μm, the feature resolutions in the horizontal and vertical directions are 150 μm and 50 μm, respectively. The multi-depth molds were successfully printed at the same time and the multi-depth features were transferred properly to the polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) having multi-depth channels via soft lithography. A flow-focusing droplet generator with a multi-depth channel was fabricated using the presented 3D printing method. Experimental results show that the multi-depth channel could manipulate the morphology and size of droplets, which is desired for many engineering applications. Taken together, LCD SLA 3D printing is an excellent alternative method to the multi-step photolithography for the fabrication of multi-depth microfluidic devices. Taking the advantages of its controllability, cost-effectiveness, and acceptable resolution, LCD SLA 3D printing can have a great potential to fabricate 3D microfluidic devices.},

ABSTRACT = {The purpose of the study was to propose a strategy to assess the potential reduction of the production cost during wire+arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) based on the combination of wire feed speed (related to deposition rate) and travel speed (related to deposition time). A series of experiments, using a multilayer-non-oscillated single pass wall made of an Al-Mg alloy, was conducted. The quality of the wall was assessed through the lateral surface waviness and top layer undulation. The concepts of Surface Waviness and Buy-to-Apply indices were introduced. Initially, the range of travel speed (TS) that provided layers with acceptable quality was determined for a given wire feed speed (WFS), corresponding to a constant current. Then, the effect of the increase of production capacity of the process (though current raising, yet maintaining the ratio WFS/TS constant) on the wall quality for a given condition within the TS range was assessed. The results showed that the useful range of TS prevents too rough a waving surface below the lower limit and top surface undulation over the higher limit. However, inside the range, there is little quality variation for the case under study. Finally, simulations of deposition time were developed to demonstrate the weight of the TS on the final deposition time and wall quality as a function of a target wall width. This respective weight showed the existence of a complex and unpredictable, yet determined, power of a combination of TS, target wall geometry, and dead time between subsequent layers. It was verified to be possible to find optimized TS as a function of different target geometries.},

ABSTRACT = {Maleic anhydride (MA) grafted with poly(trimethylene terephthalate) (PTT)—abbreviated as PTT-g-MA—can be used as a compatibilizing agent to improve the compatibility and dispersion of nanofillers and a dispersed polymer phase into PTT matrix. This work suggests the preparation of PTT-g-MA using a mixture of PTT, MA, and benzoyl peroxide (BPO) by a reactive extrusion process. PTT-g-MA was characterized to confirm the grafting reaction of maleic anhydride on PTT chains by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Thermal properties (differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)) and rheological analysis (parallel plates rheology) were used to prove the changes that occurred after the graphitization reaction. The reactive processing route allowed the production of the compatibilizing agent (PTT-g-MA) with good thermal properties and with lower viscosity compared to neat PTT, and this could be an alternative for the compatibilization of polymer blends, as example for PTT/ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene) blends and nanocomposites based on PTT matrix.},

ABSTRACT = {T-welded joints are commonly seen in various industrial assemblies. An effort is made to check the applicability of friction stir welding for producing T-joints made of AA6063-T6 using a developed fixture. Quality T-joints were produced free from any surface defects. The effects of three parameters, such as the speed of rotation of the tool, axial force, and travel speed were analyzed. Correspondingly, mechanical characteristics such as tensile strength, hardness in three zones (thermal heat affected zone, heat affected zone, and nugget zone) and temperature distribution were measured. The full factorial analysis was performed with various combinations of parameters generated using factorial design and responses. Evident changes in the strength, hardness, and temperature profile were noticed for each combination of parameters. The three main parameters were significant in every response with p-values less than 0.05, indicating their importance in the friction stir welding process. Mathematical models developed for investigated responses were satisfactory with high R-sq and least percentage error.},

ABSTRACT = {Machining processes, including turning, are a critical capability for discrete part production. One limitation to high material removal rates and reduced cost in these processes is chatter, or unstable spindle speed-chip width combinations that exhibit a self-excited vibration. In this paper, an artificial neural network (ANN)—a data learning model—is applied to model turning stability. The novel approach is to use a physics-based process model—the analytical stability limit—to generate a (synthetic) data set that trains the ANN. This enables the process physics to be combined with data learning in a hybrid approach. As anticipated, it is observed that the number and distribution of training points influences the ability of the ANN model to capture the smaller, more closely spaced lobes that occur at lower spindle speeds. Overall, the ANN is successful (>90% accuracy) at predicting the stability behavior after appropriate training.},

ABSTRACT = {Producing metallic bipolar plates for Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) fuel cells by forming is still a topic of research. So far, it has mainly been applied for small batches, but it offers substantial advantages regarding both costs and installation space compared to the established graphite based solutions. One new possibility for an efficient manufacturing process of these metallic bipolar plates is the forming by rolling. For the first time, this technology was used for relevant industrial scale channel geometries. By the use of an experimental rolling mill, 0.1 mm thick 316L (1.4404) stainless steel foils were roll-formed to achieve previously designed channel geometries within one rolling pass. The conducted experiments show promising results regarding the forming accuracy and the shape of the channel cross-sections. With the aim for a proof of concept in the beginning and a subsequent optimization of the process, a numerical simulation was set up prior to the real experiments and later calibrated with the experimental forming results. This calibrated model was used for further improvements of the process with the objective at reducing wrinkles and distortion. The investigation of this new process method for the manufacturing of metallic bipolar plates shows enormous potential and can lead to a more efficient and cheaper production.},

ABSTRACT = {The quality and reliability in additive manufacturing is an emerging area. To ensure process quality and reliability, the influence of all process parameters and conditions needs to be understood. The product quality and reliability characteristics, i.e., dimensional accuracy, precision, repeatability, and reproducibility are mostly affected by inherent and systematic manufacturing process variations. This paper presents research on dimensional quality and distortion analysis of AlSi10Mg thin-walled parts developed by a selective laser melting technique. The input process parameters were fixed, and the impact of inherent process variation on dimensional accuracy and precision was studied. The process stability and variability were examined under repeatability and reproducibility conditions. The sample length (horizontal dimension) results revealed a 0.05 mm maximum dimensional error, 0.0197 mm repeatability, and 0.0169 mm reproducibility. Similarly, in sample height (vertical dimension) results, 0.258 mm maximum dimensional error, 0.0237 mm repeatability, and 0.0863 mm reproducibility were observed. The effect of varying design thickness on thickness accuracy was analyzed, and regression analysis performed. The maximum 0.038 mm error and 0.018 mm standard deviation was observed for the 1 mm thickness sample, which significantly decreased for sample thickness ≥2 mm. The % error decreased exponentially with increasing sample thickness. The distortion analysis was performed to explore the effect of sample thickness on part distortion. The 0.5 mm thickness sample shows a very high distortion comparatively, and it is reduced significantly for >0.5 mm thickness samples. The study is further extended to examine the effect of solution heat treatment and artificial aging on the accuracy, precision, and distortion; however, it did not improve the results. Conclusively, the sample dimensions, i.e., length and height, have shown fluctuations due to inherent process characteristics under repeatability and reproducibility conditions. The ANOVA results revealed that sample length means are not statistically significantly different, whereas sample height means are significantly different. The horizontal dimensions in the xy-plane have better accuracy and precision compared to the vertical dimension in the z-axis. The accuracy and precision increased, whereas part distortion decreased with increasing thickness.},

ABSTRACT = {The implementation of sustainable machining process can be accomplished by different strategies including process optimization and selection of the proper lubrication techniques and cutting conditions. The present study is carried out from the perspective of a sustainability assessment of turning Ti-6Al-4V by employing minimum quantity lubrication (MQL) and MQL-nanofluid with consideration of the surface quality, tool wear, and power consumption. A sustainability assessment algorithm was used to assess the cutting processes of Ti-6Al-4V alloy under a minimum quantity of lubrication–nanofluid to estimate the levels of sustainable design variables. The assessment included the sustainable indicators as well as the machining responses in a single integrated model. The sustainable aspects included in this study were; environmental impact, management of waste, and safety and health issues of operators. The novelty here lies in employing a comprehensive sustainability assessment model to discuss and understand the machining process with MQL-nanofluid, by not only considering the machining quality characteristics, but also taking into account different sustainability indicators. In order to validate the effectiveness of the sustainability results, a comparison between the optimal and predicted responses was conducted and a good agreement was noticed. It should be stated that MQL-nanofluid showed better results compared to the cutting tests conducted under using classical MQL.},

ABSTRACT = {The use of lightweight material such as CFRP/Ti6Al4V in stacked structures in the aerospace industry is associated with improved physical and mechanical characteristics. The drilling process of nonuniform structures plays a significant role prior to the assembly operation. However, this drilling process is typically associated with unacceptable CFRP delamination, hole accuracy, and high tool wear. These machining difficulties are attributed to high thermal load and poor chip evacuation mechanism. Low-frequency vibration-assisted drilling (LF-VAD) is an advanced manufacturing technique where the dynamic change of the uncut chip thickness is used to manipulate the cutting energy. An efficient chip evacuation mechanism was achieved through axial tool oscillation. This study investigates the effect of vibration-assisted drilling machining parameters on tool wear mechanisms. The paper also presents the effect of tool wear progression on drilled hole quality. Hole quality is described by CFRP entry and exit delamination and hole accuracy. The results showed a significant reduction in the thrust force, cutting torque, cutting temperature, and flank wear-land.},

ABSTRACT = {The potential of Additive Manufacturing (AM) is high, with a whole new set of manufactured parts with unseen complexity being offered. However, the process has limitations, and for the sake of economic competitiveness, these should also be considered. Therefore, a computational methodology, capable of including the referenced limitations and providing initial solid designs for Selective Laser Melting (SLM) is the subject of the present work. The combination of Topology Optimization (TO) with the simplified fabrication model is the selected methodology. Its formulation, implementation, and integration on the classic TO algorithm is briefly discussed, being capable of addressing the minimum feature size and the overhang constraint limitations. Moreover, the performance and numerical stability of the methodology is evaluated, and numerical variables, such as the accuracy of structural equilibrium equations and the material interpolation model, are considered. A comparative study between these variables is presented. The paper then proposes an enhanced version of the selected methodology, with a better convergence towards a discrete solution.},

ABSTRACT = {Assessment of the mechanical performance of internally-defected components or struc-tures is of crucial importance to many industrial fields such as aerospace, automobile, marine, construction etc. Most of the studies available in the literature include only analytical or numerical solutions, due to difficulty in the manufacturing of a testing sample with a specific internal defect geometry for experimental evaluations. In this study, Fusion Deposition Modeling (FDM) was utilized in the 3D-printing of Polylactic Acid (PLA) samples with internal cracks, aiming to assess their impact on the samples’ mechanical performance. The defect geometry, orientation, location along the sample gauge length and the influence of the process parameters, such as the infill percentage and the material color, were investigated. The influence of the internal defects is more pronounced for a 100% infill rate if compared with a 50% infill rate as a consequence of the porosity. A maximum drop of ~14% in the peak load of defect-free samples was recorded due to the presence of the internal defect. Moreover, the additive color to the PLA material might contribute to the material strength. Generally, the findings of this work could open another door for utilizing the additive manufacturing in many research areas, with potential industrial applications relevant to the assessment of internally-defected materials.},

The results of the present study provided valuable insights into the static and creep properties of LPBF IN625 alloy, as compared to a wrought annealed alloy of similar composition. It was shown that at temperatures below 538 °C, the mechanical resistance and elongation to failure of the LPBF alloy were similar to those of its wrought counterpart, whereas at higher temperatures, the elongation to failure of the LPBF alloy became significantly lower than that of the wrought alloy. The solution-treated LPBF alloy exhibited significantly improved creep properties at 760 °C as compared to the wrought annealed alloy, especially under intermediate and low levels of stress.},

ABSTRACT = {This work presents the first practical application of ionic electrolytes for electropolishing of nickel-based superalloys. It contains the results of an experiment-driven optimization of the applied potential and electrolyte temperature during electropolishing of laser powder bed-fused IN625 components containing surfaces oriented to the building platform under angles varying from 0 to 135°. For comparative purposes, the roughness profilometry and confocal microscopy techniques were used to characterize the surface finish topographies and the material removal rates of IN625 components subjected to electropolishing in ionic and acidic (reference) electrolytes. After 4 h of electropolishing in both electrolytes, a roughness of Ra ≤ 6.3 µm (ISO N9 grade number of roughness) was obtained for all the build orientations. To elaborate, both electrolytes manifested identical roughness evolutions with time on the 45° (75% Ra reduction) and 90°-oriented (65% Ra reduction) surfaces. Although the roughness reduction on the 135°-oriented surface in the ionic electrolyte was 17% less than in the acidic electrolyte, the former provided a more uniform roughness profile on the 0°-oriented surface (30% Ra reduction) and 44% higher current efficiency than the acidic electrolyte. This work proves that ionic electrolytes constitute a greener alternative to industrial acidic mixtures for electropolishing of three-dimensional (3D)-printed parts from nickel-based superalloys.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper focusses on the effect of hot isostatic pressing (HIP) and a solution annealing post treatment on the fatigue strength of selectively laser melted (SLM) AlSi10Mg structures. The aim of this work is to assess the effect of the unprocessed (as-built) surface and residual stresses, regarding the fatigue behaviour for each condition. The surface roughness of unprocessed specimens is evaluated based on digital light optical microscopy and subsequent three-dimensional image post processing. To holistically characterize contributing factors to the fatigue strength, the axial surface residual stress of all specimens with unprocessed surfaces is measured using X-ray diffraction. Furthermore, the in-depth residual stress distribution of selected samples is analyzed. The fatigue strength is evaluated by tension-compression high-cycle fatigue tests under a load stress ratio of R = −1. For the machined specimens, intrinsic defects like pores or intermetallic phases are identified as the failure origin. Regarding the unprocessed test series, surface features cause the failures that correspond to significantly reduced cyclic material properties of approximately −60% referring to machined ones. There are beneficial effects on the surface roughness and residual stresses evoked due to the post treatments. Considering the aforementioned influencing factors, this study provides a fatigue assessment of the mentioned conditions of the investigated Al-material.},

ABSTRACT = {In the drive towards a sustainable bio-economy, a growing interest exists in the development of composite materials using renewable natural resources. This paper explores the life cycle assessment of processing of Flax fibre reinforced polylactic acid (PLA), with a comparison of glass fibre triaxial fabric in the production process. The use of hydrocarbon fossil resources and synthetic fibres, such as glass and carbon, have caused severe environmental impacts in their entire life cycles. Whereas, Flax/PLA is one of the cornerstones for the sustainable economic growth of natural fibre composites. In this study, the manufacturing processes for the production of Flax/PLA tape and triaxial glass fibre were evaluated through a gate-to-gate life cycle assessment (LCA). The assessment was based on an input-output model to estimate energy demand and environmental impacts. The quality of the natural hybrid composite produced and cost-effectiveness of their LCA was dependent on their roving processing speeds and temperature applied to both the Flax/PLA tape and triaxial glass fabrics during processing. The optimum processing condition was found to be at a maximum of 4 m/min at a constant temperature of 170 °C. In contrast, the optimum for normal triaxial glass fibre production was at a slower speed of 1 m/min using a roving glass fibre laminating machine. The results showed that when the Flax and PLA were combined to produce new composite material in the form of a flax/PLA tape, energy consumption was 0.25 MJ/kg, which is lower than the 0.8 MJ/kg used for glass fibre fabric process. Flax/PLA tape and glass fibre fabric composites have a carbon footprint equivalent to 0.036 kg CO2 and 0.11 kg CO2, respectively, under the same manufacturing conditions. These are within the technical requirements in the composites industry. The manufacturing process adopted to transform Flax/PLA into a similar tape composite was considerably quicker than that of woven glass fibre fabric for composite tape. This work elucidated the relationship of the energy consumptions of the two materials processes by using a standard LCA analytical methodology. The outcomes supported an alternative option for replacement of some conventional composite materials for the automotive industry. Most importantly, the natural fibre composite production is shown to result in an economic benefit and reduced environmental impact.},

ABSTRACT = {Additive Manufacturing (AM) is gaining enormous attention from academic and industrial sectors for product development using different materials. Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) is a popular AM method that works with thermoplastics. This process offers benefits of customisation both in terms of hardware and software in the case of desktop-based FDM systems. Enhancement of mechanical properties for the traditional thermoplastic material is a widely researched area and various materials have been added to achieve this goal. This paper focuses on the manufacture of glass fiber reinforced plastic (GFRP) composites using Hybrid Fused Deposition Modelling (HFDM). Commonly available polylactic acid or polylactide (PLA) material was inter-laced with 0.03 mm thick glass fiber sheets to manufacture GFRP products followed by tensile testing. This was done to investigate whether adding more layers increases the tensile strength of the GFRP products or not. Furthermore, the maximum number of glass fiber layers that can be added to the 4 mm thick specimen was also identified. This was done to demonstrate that there is an optimal number of glass fiber layers that can be added as after this optimal number, the tensile strength start to deteriorate. Microstructural analysis was undertaken after tensile testing followed by ultrasonic testing to assess the uniformity of the GFRP composites.},

ABSTRACT = {Spherical powders with single-mode (D50 = 36.31 µm), and bimodal (D50,L = 36.31 µm, D50,s = 5.52 µm) particle size distribution were used in selective laser melting of 316L stainless steel in nitrogen atmosphere at volumetric energy densities ranging from 35.7–116.0 J/mm3. Bimodal particle size distribution could provide up to 2% greater tap density than single-mode powder. For low laser power (107–178 W), where relative density was <99%, bimodal feedstock resulted in higher density than single-mode feedstock. However, at higher power (>203 W), the density of bimodal-fed components decreased as the energy density increased due to vaporizing of the fine powder in bimodal distributions. Size of intergranular cell regions did not appear to vary significantly between single-mode and bimodal specimens (0.394–0.531 µm2 at 81–116 J/mm3). Despite higher packing densities in powder feedstock with bimodal particle size distribution, the results of this study suggest that differences in conduction melting and vaporization points between the two primary particle sizes would limit the maximum achievable density of additively manufactured components produced from bimodal powder size distribution.},

ABSTRACT = {Industry 4.0 requires phenomenon twins to functionalize the relevant systems (e.g., cyber-physical systems). A phenomenon twin means a computable virtual abstraction of a real phenomenon. In order to systematize the construction process of a phenomenon twin, this study proposes a system defined as the phenomenon twin construction system. It consists of three components, namely the input, processing, and output components. Among these components, the processing component is the most critical one that digitally models, simulates, and validates a given phenomenon extracting information from the input component. What kind of modeling, simulation, and validation approaches should be used while constructing the processing component for a given phenomenon is a research question. This study answers this question using the case of surface roughness—a complex phenomenon associated with all material removal processes. Accordingly, this study shows that for modeling the surface roughness of a machined surface, the approach called semantic modeling is more effective than the conventional approach called the Markov chain. It is also found that to validate whether or not a simulated surface roughness resembles the expected roughness, the outcomes of the possibility distribution-based computing and DNA-based computing are more effective than the outcomes of a conventional computing wherein the arithmetic mean height of surface roughness is calculated. Thus, apart from the conventional computing approaches, the leading edge computational intelligence-based approaches can digitize manufacturing processes more effectively.},

ABSTRACT = {This study aims to assess the effect of printing parameters on the final tensile properties of 3D printed specimens printed through a popular vat-photopolymerization printer—‘Form 2’. Elastic modulus, ultimate tensile strength and strain at break are analyzed as a function of process parameters in order to provide an optimized print parameter configuration. Design of Experiments (DoE) using Taguchi’s techniques was used to print the test samples. Tensile tests were performed on the 3D printed specimens following the ISO-527 standard. The post-experiment analysis provide more insight on the effect of each studied factor on the elastic properties of these specimens. To complete this study, an analysis of the total manufacturing process time is presented with respect to the aforementioned elastic properties. The study shows that the parts are orthotropic and sensitive to layer height and post-curing. The orthotropic behaviour can be substantially reduced by appropriate post-curing process, resulting in high improvement of the elastic modulus and ultimate tensile strength. This paper is of special interest to researchers and users of desktop 3D printers who wish to improve the performance of their equipment, compare printing capabilities or assess the effect of different hardware on a single resin.},

ABSTRACT = {The additive manufacturing (AM) process induces high uncertainty in the mechanical properties of 3D-printed parts, which represents one of the main barriers for a wider AM processes adoption. To address this problem, a new time-efficient microstructure prediction algorithm was proposed in this study for the laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) process. Based on a combination of the melt pool modeling and the design of experiment approaches, this algorithm was used to predict the microstructure (grain size/aspect ratio) of materials processed by an EOS M280 LPBF system, including Iron and IN625 alloys. This approach was successfully validated using experimental and literature data, thus demonstrating its potential efficiency for the optimization of different LPBF powders and systems.},

ABSTRACT = {The ultrasonic spot welding of fibre-reinforced thermoplastic laminates has received great interest from researchers, mainly in the fields of aerospace and automotive industries. It offers an efficient solution to join large thermoplastic composite parts through the spot welding approach with a high level of automation. In this paper, the temporal and spatial development of the temperature in an ultrasonic weld spot between two fibre-reinforced thermoplastic laminates was modelled. During the ultrasonic welding of thermoplastic composite laminates without energy directors a sudden temperature jump in the weld spot is usually observed. The temperature increase occurs rapidly up to the decomposition of the thermoplastic matrix and causes the degradation of the weld spot. To understand the temperature distribution within the weld spot and to calculate its temporal development, the thermal problem was analysed using a two-dimensional explicit finite difference method. To evaluate the models, the calculated time traces of the temperature in the weld spot were compared with the experimentally obtained values under comparable conditions.},

ABSTRACT = {In conventional forming processes, quasi-static conditions are a good approximation and numerical process optimization is the state of the art in industrial practice. Nevertheless, there is still a substantial need for research in the field of identification of material parameters. In production technologies with high forming velocities, it is no longer acceptable to neglect the dependency of the hardening on the forming speed. Therefore, a method for determining material characteristics in processes with high forming speeds was developed by designing and implementing a test setup and an inverse parameter identification. Two acceleration concepts were realized: a pneumatically driven one and an electromagnetically driven one. The method was verified for a mild steel and an aluminum alloy proving that the identified material parameters allow numerical modeling of high-speed processes with good accuracy. The determined material parameters for steel show significant differences for different stress states. For specimen geometries with predominantly uniaxial tensile strain at forming speeds in the order of 104–105/s the determined yield stress was nearly twice as high compared to shear samples; an effect which does not occur under quasi-static loading. This trend suggests a triaxiality-dependent rate dependence, which might be attributed to shear band induced strain localization and adiabatic heating.},

ABSTRACT = {Metal additive manufacturing processes such as selective laser melting (SLM), laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF), electron beam melting (EBM) and laser metal deposition (LMD) can produce additively manufactured nearly fully dense parts with high geometrical complexity. These are often used as components in automotive, aerospace and medical device industries. Finish machining of these components is required to achieve the desired surface finish and dimensional tolerances. The investigations on additively manufactured alloys, as reported in the literature, indicate that a layer-wise scan strategy (orthogonal or layer-to-layer rotation) and process parameters have significant influences on the resultant microstructure which affects the final mechanical properties and fatigue life. The solidification microstructure depicts that growth directions of columnar grains and sizes of cellular grains that are affected by the layer-wise scan strategy. This paper presents experimental investigations on finish milling parameters on a nickel-based alloy manufactured with L-PBF using two distinct layer-wise scan strategies. The results reveal some effects of milling direction against the layer-wise build direction. The effects of cutting speed and feed rate on resultant cutting forces, chip formation, as well as surface finish at various cutting orientations in nickel-based alloy workpieces are reported.},

ABSTRACT = {The surface roughness of the ground parts is an essential factor in the assessment of the grinding process, and a crucial criterion in choosing the dressing and grinding tools and parameters. Additionally, the surface roughness directly influences the functionality of the workpiece. The application of artificial intelligence in the prediction of complex results of machining processes, such as surface roughness and cutting forces has increasingly become popular. This paper deals with the design of the appropriate artificial neural network for the prediction of the ground surface roughness and grinding forces, through an individual integrated acoustic emission (AE) sensor in the machine tool. Two models were trained and tested. Once using only the grinding parameters, and another with both acoustic emission signals and grinding parameters as input data. The recorded AE-signal was pre-processed, amplified and denoised. The feedforward neural network was chosen for the modeling with Bayesian backpropagation, and the model was tested by various experiments with different grinding and neural network parameters. It was found that the predictions presented by the achieved network parameters model agreed well with the experimental results with a superb accuracy of 99 percent. The results also showed that the AE signals act as an additional input parameter in addition to the grinding parameters, and could significantly increase the efficiency of the neural network in predicting the grinding forces and the surface roughness.},

ABSTRACT = {Fused filament fabrication (FFF) is a cost-effective additive manufacturing method that makes use of thermoplastics to produce customised products. However, there are several limitations associated with FFF that are adversely affecting its growth including variety of materials, rough surface finish and poor mechanical properties. This has resulted in the development of metal-infused thermoplastics that can provide better properties. Furthermore, FFF-printed parts can be subjected to post-processes to improve their surface finish and mechanical properties. This work takes into consideration two commonly used polymeric materials, i.e., ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene) and PLA (polylactic acid) and compares the results with two metal-infused thermoplastics i.e., copper-enhanced PLA and aluminium-enhanced ASA (acrylonitrile styrene acrylate). The four different materials were subjected to a post-process called annealing to enhance their mechanical properties. The effect of annealing on these four materials was investigated through dimensional analysis, ultrasonic testing, tensile testing, microstructural analysis and hardness testing. The results showed that annealing affects the materials differently. However, a correlation among ultrasonic testing, tensile testing and microstructural analysis was observed for all the materials based on their crystallinity. It was found that the semi-crystalline materials (i.e., PLA and copper enhanced PLA) showed a considerable increase in tensile strength post-annealing. However, the amorphous materials (ABS and aluminium-enhanced ASA) showed a comparatively lower increase in tensile strength, demonstrating that they were less receptive to annealing. These results were supported by higher transmission times and a high percentage of voids in the amorphous materials. The highest hardness values were observed for the ASA material and the lowest for the ABS material. This work provides a good comparison for the metal-infused thermoplastics and their applicability with the commonly used PLA and ABS materials.},

ABSTRACT = {This work presents a comprehensive structure for evaluating the sustainability of machining processes. Industries can contribute towards developing a sustainable future by using algorithms that evaluate the sustainability of their processes. Inspired by the literature, the proposed model involves a set of metrics that are critical in evaluating the impact of a process on society, environment, and economy. The flexibility of this model allows decision-makers to use the available responses to identify the most favorable process. The entropy weight method was suggested for objectively calculating the weights of each indicator. A multi-criteria decision-making method i.e., Technique for Order Preference based on Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), was used to rank processes in the decreasing order of their sustainability. The proposed algorithm was successfully validated with case studies from the published literature. A MATLAB code was also created so that industries may expeditiously apply this method to evaluate the sustainability of machining processes.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper deals with the development and comparison of prediction models established using response surface methodology (RSM) and artificial neural network (ANN) for a wire electrical discharge machining (WEDM) process. The WEDM experiments were designed using central composite design (CCD) for machining of Inconel 718 superalloy. During experimentation, the pulse-on-time (TON), pulse-off-time (TOFF), servo-voltage (SV), peak current (IP), and wire tension (WT) were chosen as control factors, whereas, the kerf width (Kf), surface roughness (Ra), and materials removal rate (MRR) were selected as performance attributes. The analysis of variance tests was performed to identify the control factors that significantly affect the performance attributes. The double hidden layer ANN model was developed using a back-propagation ANN algorithm, trained by the experimental results. The prediction accuracy of the established ANN model was found to be superior to the RSM model. Finally, the Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA- II) was implemented to determine the optimum WEDM conditions from multiple objectives.},

ABSTRACT = {A numerical model that incorporates temperature-dependent non-Newtonian viscosity was developed to simulate the extrusion process in extrusion-based additive manufacturing. Agreement with the experimental data was achieved by simulating a polylactic acid melt flow as a non-isothermal power law fluid using experimentally fitted parameters for polylactic acid. The model was used to investigate the temperature effect on the flow behavior, the cross-sectional area, and the uniformity of the extruded strand. OpenFOAM, an open source simulation tool based on the finite volume method, was used to perform the simulations. A computational module for solving the equations of non-isothermal multiphase flows was also developed to simulate the extrusion process under a small gap condition where the gap between the nozzle and the substrate surface is smaller than the nozzle diameter. Comparison of the strand shapes obtained from our model with isothermal Newtonian simulation, and experimental data confirms that our model improves the agreement with the experimental data. The result shows that the cross-sectional area of the extruded strand is sensitive to the temperature-dependent viscosity, especially in the small gap condition which has recently increased in popularity. Our numerical investigation was able to show nozzle temperature effects on the strand shape and surface topography which previously had been investigated and observed empirically only.},

Two limited studied parameters were considered (extraction temperature and wall thickness), each one having three levels. External X and Y dimensions were measured using a micrometer, as well as four surface roughness parameters (Ra, Rz, Rt, Rsm) with a surface tester. Two optimization techniques (the Taguchi approach and Grey relational analysis) were utilized along with statistical analysis to examine how the temperature and wall thickness affect the dimensional accuracy and the surface quality of the parts. The results showed that high extraction temperature and median wall thickness values optimize both dimensional accuracy and surface roughness, while temperature is the most important factor.},

ABSTRACT = {Deep hole boring using slender bars that have tuned mass dampers integrated within them make the boring process chatter vibration resistant. Dampers are usually designed using classical analytical solutions that presume the (un)damped boring bar which can be approximated by a single degree of freedom system, and the damper is placed at the free end. Since the free end is also the cutting end, analytical models may result in infeasible design solutions. To place optimally tuned dampers within boring bars, but away from the free end, this paper presents a receptance coupling approach in which the substructural receptances of the boring bar modelled as a cantilevered Euler–Bernoulli beam are combined with the substructural receptances of a damper modelled as a rigid mass integrated anywhere within the bar. The assembled and damped system response thus obtained is used to predict the chatter-free machining stability limit. Maximization of this limit is treated as the objective function to find the optimal mass, stiffness and damping of the absorber. Proposed solutions are first verified against other classical solutions for assumed placement of the absorber at the free end. Verified models then guide prototyping of a boring bar integrated with a damper placed away from its free end. Experiments demonstrate a ~100-fold improvement in chatter vibration free machining capability. The generalized methods presented herein can be easily extended to design and develop other damped and chatter-resistant tooling systems.},

ABSTRACT = {Numerical simulation of laser drilling is rapidly gaining interest in academia and industry since this process remains one of the most important and widely-used technologies in modern manufacturing. Meshfree methods such as Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) have proven to be successful as a numerical tool for the computation of the heat transfer and material removal associated with a laser drilling problem. Nonetheless, the vast majority of recent developments incorporate an inconsistent SPH kernel into their thermal simulations. In this paper, several enhanced schemes are implemented to address this problem by solving the heat transfer more accurately. These meshfree schemes can provide a second-order accurate discretization of the Laplace operator and abolish the inconsistency issue of the standard SPH kernels. An efficient approach is additionally suggested to handle the associated boundary conditions, which relies on the idea of the color function and particle label. The implementation is initially validated by a 3D benchmark study and then applied for the first time to a laser drilling problem.},

ABSTRACT = {Based on the drive signals of a milling center, process forces can be reconstructed. Therefore, a novel approach is presented to reconstruct the process forces with a long short-term memory neural network (LSTM) using drive signals as an input. The LSTM is evaluated and compared to a model-based approach. The latter compensates nonlinearities and disturbances such as friction and inertia. For training of the LSTM, multiple milling processes are considered to enhance the generalizability. Training data is generated by recording drive signals and process forces measured by a dynamometer. The LSTM is then evaluated using a test set, which comprises new process parameters. It is shown that the LSTM has a lower root mean square error (RMSE) in comparison to the model-based approach. Especially, when changing the feed motion direction during milling, the neural network clearly outperforms the model-based approach. Nevertheless, there are processes, where the LSTM induced oscillations, which do not correspond to the measured forces.},

ABSTRACT = {In manufacturing industries, selecting the appropriate cutting parameters is essential to improve the product quality. As a result, the applications of optimization techniques in metal cutting processes is vital for a quality product. Due to the complex nature of the machining processes, single objective optimization approaches have limitations, since several different and contradictory objectives must be simultaneously optimized. Multi-objective optimization method is introduced to find the optimum cutting parameters to avoid this dilemma. The main objective of this paper is to develop a multi-objective optimization algorithm using the hybrid Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA). In order to perform the multi-objective optimization, grey analysis is integrated with the WOA algorithm. In this paper, Stainless Steel 304 is utilized for turning operation to study the effect of machining parameters such as cutting speed, feed rate and depth of cut on surface roughness, cutting forces, power, peak tool temperature, material removal rate and heat rate. The output parameters are obtained through series of simulations and experiments. Then by using this hybrid optimization algorithm the optimum machining conditions for turning operation is achieved by considering unit cost and quality of production. It is also found that with the change of output parameter weightage, the optimum cutting condition varies. In addition to that, the effects of different cutting parameters on surface roughness and power consumption are analysed.},

Conditions for machining operations were traditionally selected based on geometry and surface finish requirements. However, nowadays, many researchers are optimizing machining parameters since high-quality products can be produced using more expensive and advanced machines and tools. There are a few methods to optimize the machining process, such as minimizing unit production time or cost or maximizing profit. This research focused on maximizing the profit of computer numerical control (CNC) milling operations by optimizing machining parameters. Cutting speeds and feed are considered as the main process variables to maximize the profit of CNC milling operations as they have the greatest effect on machining operation. In this research, the Nelder–Mead simplex method was used to maximize the profit of CNC milling processes by optimizing machining parameters. The Nelder–Mead simplex method was used to calculate best, worst, and second-worst value based on an initial guess. The possible range of machining parameters was limited by several constraints. The Nelder–Mead simplex method yielded a profit of 3.45 ($/min) when applied to a commonly used case study model.},

ABSTRACT = {Lightweight structures in the automotive and transportation industry are increasingly researched. Multiple materials with tailored properties are integrated into structures via a large spectrum of joining techniques. Welding is a viable solution in mass scale production in an automotive sector still dominated by steels, although hybrid structures involving other materials like aluminum are becoming increasingly important. The welding of dissimilar metals is difficult if not impossible, due to their differential thermo mechanical properties along with the formation of intermetallic compounds, particularly when fusion welding is envisioned. Solid-state welding, as with magnetic pulse welding, is of particular interest due to its short processing cycles. However, electromagnetic pulse welding is constrained by the selection of processing parameters, particularly the coil design and its life cycle. This paper investigates two inductor designs, a linear (I) and O shape, for the joining of sheet metals involving aluminum and steels. The O shape inductor is found to be more efficient both with magnetic pulse (MPW) and magnetic pulse spot welding (MPSW) and offers a better life cycle. Both simulation and experimental mechanical tests are presented to support the effect of inductor design on the process performance.},

ABSTRACT = {Inconel 718 alloy fabricated by selective laser melting (SLM) (or laser powder-bed fusion (LPBF)) has been post-process heat-treated by stress-relief anneal at 1065 °C; stress-relief anneal (1065 °C) + solution treatment (at 720 °C) + aging (at 620 °C); hot isostatic pressing (HIP) (at 1120–1200 °C); stress-relief anneal + HIP; and stress-relief anneal + HIP + solution treatment + aging. Microstructure analysis utilizing optical metallography revealed primarily equiaxed grain structures (having average diameters ranging from ~30 to 49 microns) containing annealing twins, and a high concentration of carbide precipitates in all HIP-related treatments in the grain boundaries and intragrain regions. However, no precipitates nucleated on the {111} coherent annealing twin boundaries because of their very low interfacial free energy in contrast to regular grain boundaries. The mechanical properties for the as-fabricated Inconel 718 exhibited a yield stress of 0.64 GPa, UTS of 0.98 GPa, and elongation of 26%. Following stress-relief anneal at 1065 °C, the yield stress dropped to 0.60 GPa, while the elongation increased to 43%. The associated grain structure was an irregular, somewhat elongated, recrystallized structure. This structure was preserved at a stress anneal at 1065 °C + solution treatment + aging, but grain boundary and intragrain precipitation resulted in a doubling of the yield stress to 1.3 GPa and a reduced elongation of 12.6%. The results of HIP-related post-process heat treatments involving temperatures above 1060 °C demonstrated that the yield stress and elongations could be varied from 1.07 to 1.17 GPa and 11.4% to 19%, respectively. Corresponding Rockwell C-scale hardness values also varied from 33 for the as-fabricated Inconel 718 to 53 for simple post-process HIP treatment at 1163 °C.},

ABSTRACT = {Due to their flexibility, low cost and large working volume, 6-axis articulated industrial robots are increasingly being used for drilling, trimming and machining operations, especially in aerospace manufacturing. However, producing high quality components has demonstrated to be difficult, as a result of the inherent problems of robots, including low structural stiffness and low positional accuracy. These limit robotic machining to non-critical components and parts with low accuracy and surface finish requirements. Studies have been carried out to improve robotic machine capability, specifically positioning accuracy and vibration reduction. This study includes the description of the hardware, software and methodologies developed to compensate robot path errors in real time using a single three-degrees-of-freedom (DOF) laser tracker, as well as the experimental results with and without compensation. Performance tests conducted include ballbar dynamic path accuracy test, a series of drilling case studies and a machining test. The results demonstrate major improvements in path accuracy, hole position accuracy and hole quality, as well as increases in accuracy of a machined aluminum part.},

ABSTRACT = {Micrographic image analysis, tomography and the Archimedes method are commonly used to analyze the porosity of Selective Laser Melting (SLM)-produced parts and then to estimate the relative density. This article deals with the limitation of the relative density results to conclude on the quality of a part manufactured by additive manufacturing and focuses on the interpretation of the relative density result. To achieve this aim, two experimental methods are used: the image analysis method, which provides local information on the distribution of porosity, and the Archimedes method, which provides access to global information. To investigate this, two different grades of aluminum alloy, AlSi7Mg0.6 and AM205, were used in this study. The study concludes that an analysis of the metallographic images to calculate the relative density of the part depends on the areas chosen for the analysis. In addition, the results show that the Archimedes method has limitations, particularly related to the choice of reference materials for calculating relative density. It can be observed, for example, that, depending on the experimental conditions, the calculation can lead to relative densities higher than 100%, which is inconsistent. This article shows that it is essential that a result of relative density obtained from Archimedes measurements be supplemented by an indication of the reference density used.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper presents a framework to utilize multivariate time series data to automatically identify reoccurring events, e.g., resembling failure patterns in real-world manufacturing data by combining selected data mining techniques. The use case revolves around the auxiliary polymer manufacturing process of drying and feeding plastic granulate to extrusion or injection molding machines. The overall framework presented in this paper includes a comparison of two different approaches towards the identification of unique patterns in the real-world industrial data set. The first approach uses a subsequent heuristic segmentation and clustering approach, the second branch features a collaborative method with a built-in time dependency structure at its core (TICC). Both alternatives have been facilitated by a standard principle component analysis PCA (feature fusion) and a hyperparameter optimization (TPE) approach. The performance of the corresponding approaches was evaluated through established and commonly accepted metrics in the field of (unsupervised) machine learning. The results suggest the existence of several common failure sources (patterns) for the machine. Insights such as these automatically detected events can be harnessed to develop an advanced monitoring method to predict upcoming failures, ultimately reducing unplanned machine downtime in the future.},

ABSTRACT = {The design and development of composite structures requires precise and robust manufacturing processes. Composite materials such as fiber reinforced thermoplastics (FRTP) provide a good balance between manufacturing time, mechanical performance and weight. In this contribution, we investigate the process combination of thermoforming FRTP sheets (organo sheets) and injection overmolding of short FRTP for automotive structures. The limiting factor in those structures is the bond strength between the organo sheet and the overmolded thermoplastic. Within this process chain, even small deviations of the process settings (e.g., temperature) can lead to significant defects in the structure. A cyber physical production system based framework for a digital twin combining simulation and machine learning is presented. Based on parametric Finite-Element-Method (FEM) studies, training data for machine learning methods are generated and a FEM surrogate is developed. A comparison of different data-driven methods yields information on the estimation accuracy of task-specific data-driven methods. Finally, in accordance with experimental cross tension tests, the investigated FEM surrogate model is able to predict the interface bond strength quality in dependence of the process settings. The visualization into different quality domains qualifies the presented approach as decision support.},

ABSTRACT = {Cyber-physical production systems (CPPS) and digital twins (DT) with a data-driven core enable retrospective analyses of acquired data to achieve a pervasive system understanding and can further support prospective operational management in production systems. Cost pressure and environmental compliances sensitize facility operators for energy and resource efficiency within the whole life cycle while achieving reliability requirements. In manufacturing systems, technical building services (TBS) such as cooling towers (CT) are drivers of resource demands while they fulfil a vital mission to keep the production running. Data-driven approaches, such as data mining (DM), help to support operators in their daily business. Within this paper the development of a data-driven DT for TBS operation is presented and applied on an industrial CT case study located in Germany. It aims to improve system understanding and performance prediction as essentials for a successful operational management. The approach comprises seven consecutive steps in a broadly applicable workflow based on the CRISP-DM paradigm. Step by step, the workflow is explained including a tailored data pre-processing, transformation and aggregation as well as feature selection procedure. The graphical presentation of interim results in portfolio diagrams, heat maps and Sankey diagrams amongst others to enhance the intuitive understanding of the procedure. The comparative evaluation of selected DM algorithms confirms a high prediction accuracy for cooling capacity (R2 = 0.96) by using polynomial regression and electric power demand (R2 = 0.99) by linear regression. The results are evaluated graphically and the transfer into industrial practice is discussed conclusively.},

ABSTRACT = {The resources of modern Finite Element Analysis (FEA) software provide engineers with powerful mechanisms that can be used to investigate numerous machining processes with satisfying results. Nevertheless, the success of a simulation, especially in three dimensions, relies heavily on the accuracy of the cutting tool models that are implemented in the analyses. With this in mind, the present paper presents an application developed via Computer-Aided Design (CAD) programming that enables the automated design of accurate cutting tool models that can be used in 3D turning simulations. The presented application was developed with the aid of the programming resources of a commercially available CAD system. Moreover, the parametric design methodology was employed in order to design the tools according to the appropriate standards. Concluding, a sample tool model was tested by performing a number of machining simulations based on typical cutting parameters. The yielded results were then compared to experimental values of the generated machining force components for validation. The findings of the study prove the functionality of the tool models since a high level of agreement occurred between the acquired numerical results and the experimental ones.},

This paper discusses and defines essential elements of virtual quality gates in the context of manufacturing systems. To support the planning and implementation of virtual quality gates, a morphological box is developed which can be used to identify and derive an individual approach for a virtual quality gate based on the specific characteristics and requirements of the respective manufacturing system.

ABSTRACT = {The performance indicator, Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE), is one of the most important ones for production control, as it merges information of equipment usage, process yield, and product quality. The determination of the OEE is oftentimes not transparent in companies, due to the heterogeneous data sources and manual interference. Furthermore, there is a difference in present guidelines to calculate the OEE. Due to a big amount of sensor data in Cyber Physical Production Systems, Machine Learning methods can be used in order to detect several elements of the OEE by a trained model. Changeover time is one crucial aspect influencing the OEE, as it adds no value to the product. Furthermore, changeover processes are fulfilled manually and vary from worker to worker. They always have their own procedure to conduct a changeover of a machine for a new product or production lot. Hence, the changeover time as well as the process itself vary. Thus, a new Machine Learning based concept for identification and characterization of machine set-up actions is presented. Here, the issue to be dealt with is the necessity of human and machine interaction to fulfill the entire machine set-up process. Because of this, the paper shows the use case in a real production scenario of a small to medium size company (SME), the derived data set, promising Machine Learning algorithms, as well as the results of the implemented Machine Learning model to classify machine set-up actions.},

ABSTRACT = {Lean production principles have greatly contributed to the efficient and customer-oriented mass production of goods and services. A core element of lean production is the focus on cycle times and designing production controls and buffers around any bottlenecks in the system. Hence, a production line organized by lean principles will operate in a static or at least quasi-static way. While the individualization of products is an interesting business approach, it can influence cycle times and in-time production. This work demonstrates how performance losses induced by highly variable cycle times can be recovered using a digital twin. The unit under analysis is an industrial joiner’s workshop. Due to the high variance in cycle time, the joinery fails its production target, even if all machines are below 80% usage. Using a discrete event simulation of the production line, different production strategies can be evaluated efficiently and systematically. It is successfully shown that the performance losses due to the highly variable cycle times can be compensated using a digital twin in combination with optimization strategies. This is achieved by operating the system in a non-static mode, exploiting the flexibilities within the systems.},

ABSTRACT = {Laser directed energy deposition (LDED) was used with a powder blend comprising 75 wt.% Rene 142 and 25 wt.% of Merl 72 (4275M72) for turbine blade tip repair applications. Sound samples could be deposited at ambient temperature on Haynes 230. The microstructural analyses showed the presence of fine gamma prime precipitates in the as-deposited samples, while after aging, the alloy possessed around 40 vol.% with a bimodal precipitate size distribution. Also, the alloy contained Ta-Hf-W carbides in different sizes and shapes. Tensile testing from room temperature up to 1366 K was performed. The 4275M72 deposits possessed higher tensile properties compared to Rene 80 in this temperature range but lower elongations at the elevated temperatures. The creep properties of 4275M72 samples at 1255 K were superior to Rene 80. Also, the oxidation resistance of deposited 4275M72 was similar to Rene 142. The combination of high mechanical properties, creep behavior, and oxidation resistance of LDEDed 4275M72 makes it a suitable alloy for tip repair of turbine blades.},

ABSTRACT = {The influence of yield function parameters on hole-expansion (HE) predictions are investigated for an anisotropic AA6022-T4 aluminum sheet. The HE experiment is performed in a fully-instrumented double-action hydraulic press with a flat-headed punch. Full strain fields are measured by a stereo-type digital image correlation (DIC) system. The stress state gradually changes from uniaxial to plane-strain tension to biaxial tension in the radial direction. Besides HE, the plastic anisotropy of AA6022-T4 is characterized by uniaxial tension and plane-strain tension experiments. Uniaxial tension is considered as the most important, since it is the stress state along the hoop direction in the hole. For the finite element (FE) simulation, the Yld2000-2d non-quadratic anisotropic yield function is used with two different parameter sets, calibrated by: (1) uniaxial tension only (termed Calib1) and, (2) both uniaxial and plane-strain tension (Calib2). The strain field predictions show a good agreement with the experiments only for Calib2, which takes into account plane-strain as well uniaxial tension. This indicates the importance of biaxial modes, and in particular plane-strain tension, for the adopted yield function to produce accurate HE simulations.},

ABSTRACT = {Minimum Quantity Lubrication nanofluid (MQL-nanofluid) is a viable sustainable alternative to conventional flood cooling and provides very good cooling and lubrication in the machining of difficult to cut materials such as titanium and Inconel. The cutting action provides very difficult conditions for the coolant to access the cutting zone and the level of difficulty increases with higher cutting speeds. Furthermore, high compressive stresses, strain hardening and high chemical activity results in the formation of a ‘seizure zone’ at the tool-chip interface. In this work, the impact of MQL-nanofluid at the seizure zone and the corresponding effects on tool wear, surface finish, and power consumption during machining of Ti-6Al-4V was investigated. Aluminum Oxide (Al2O3) nanoparticles were selected to use as nano-additives at different weight fraction concentrations (0, 2, and 4 wt.%). It was observed that under pure MQL strategy there was significant material adhesion on the rake face of the tool while the adhesion was reduced in the presence of MQL-nanofluid at the tool-chip interface, thus indicating a reduction in the tool chip contact length (TCCL) and reduced seizure effect. Furthermore, the flank wear varied from 0.162 to 0.561 mm and the average surface roughness (Ra) varied from 0.512 to 2.81 µm. The results indicate that the nanoparticle concentration and the reduction in the seizure zone positively influence the tool life and quality of surface finish.},

ABSTRACT = {Physics-based process simulations have the potential to allow virtual process design and the development of digital twins for smart machining applications. This paper presents 3D cutting simulations using the finite element method (FEM) and investigates the physical state variables that are fundamental to the reduction in cutting forces, friction, and tool wear when micro-textured cutting tools are employed. For this goal, textured cemented carbide cutting tool inserts are designed, fabricated, and tested in the orthogonal dry cutting of a nickel-chromium-molybdenum alloy steel. Cutting forces and friction coefficients are compared against the non-textured tool, revealing the effects of texture parameters. Chip flow over the textured tool surface and process variables at the chip-tool contact are investigated and compared. The results reveal the fundamental sources of such improvements. Archard’s wear rate as a composition of process variables is utilized to compare experimental and simulated wear on the textured cutting tools. The effects of texture and cutting conditions on tool wear and adhesion characteristics are further discussed on the simulation results with experimental comparisons. It was found that the results obtained from these simulations provide further fundamental insights about the micro-textured cutting tools.},

ABSTRACT = {Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) is a promising technology for production of fiber-reinforced composite parts with complex geometries. Continuous Fiber Reinforced Additively Manufactured (CFRAM) parts are becoming more prominent due to their mechanical performance, light weight, and recyclability. CFRAM components are lighter, yet they are strong materials with a wide range of potential applications in the automotive industry, aerospace, medical tools, and sports goods. The wide range of applications of these novel materials justifies the need to study their properties. Tensile is one of the most important tests to evaluate the mechanical performance of CFRAM parts. In this paper, a comprehensive study is conducted on tensile properties of CFRAM components. The composite parts are printed using a dual nozzle 3D printing machine and their tensile performance is investigated. Furthermore, the effect of fiber type, fiber content, infill density, infill pattern, and layer thickness on tensile properties was studied. Nylon was used as the matrix and Carbon fiber (CF), fiberglass (FG), and Kevlar were used as reinforcing agents. Microstructural analysis was conducted to investigate the fracture mechanism, internal morphology, interlayer adhesion, and the printing quality of specimens. Finally, a comparative study is conducted on the price and printing time of CFRAM parts. It is observed that fiber inclusion increases the tensile strength up to 2200%; moreover, increasing the fiber content improves the tensile performance of composite. The results obtained demonstrate that CF-reinforced parts have better performance compared to FG and Kevlar-reinforced components. The results show that CFRAM parts have potential to replace metals and conventional composites for engineering applications like the automobile industry.},

ABSTRACT = {This study investigated the impact of the laser speed and power, and the position and orientation of the samples, on the average surface roughness (Ra) and dimensional accuracy (DA) during CO2 laser cutting of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) thin sheets. A mixed five-parameter fractional factorial design was applied, and thirty-six measurements for the Ra and DA were obtained. The experimental results were analysed using ANOM diagrams, ANOVA analysis and interaction plots of all parameters. It was concluded that the laser speed is the critical parameter for both surface roughness and dimensional accuracy, resulting in strong interactions with laser power and positioning parameters. It was also shown that Ra values are affected by the orientation of the specimen and can be minimized when the samples are aligned in the laser travel direction. Finally, it was proved that lower laser speed improves the average roughness but reduces the dimensional accuracy.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper presents a brief introduction to competition-driven digital transformation in the machining sector. On this basis, the creation of a digital twin for machining processes is approached firstly using a basic digital twin structure. The latter is sub-grouped into information and data models, specific calculation and process models, all seen from an application-oriented perspective. Moreover, digital shadow and digital twin are embedded in this framework, being discussed in the context of a state-of-the-art literature review. The main part of this paper addresses models for machine and path inaccuracies, material removal and tool engagement, cutting force, process stability, thermal behavior, workpiece and surface properties. Furthermore, these models are superimposed towards an integral digital twin. In addition, the overall context is expanded towards an integral software architecture of a digital twin providing information system. The information system, in turn, ties in with existing forward-oriented planning from operational practice, leading to a significant expansion of the initially presented basic structure for a digital twin. Consequently, a time-stratified data layer platform is introduced to prepare for the resulting shadow-twin transformation loop. Finally, subtasks are defined to assure functional interfaces, model integrability and feedback measures.},

ABSTRACT = {Directed energy deposition (DED) is a family of additive manufacturing technologies. With these processes, metal parts are built layer by layer, introducing dynamics that propagate in time and layer-domains, which implies additional complexity and consequently, the resulting part quality is hard to predict. Control of the deposit layer thickness and height is a critical issue since it impacts on geometrical accuracy, process stability, and the overall quality of the product. Therefore, online feedback height control for DED processes with proper sensor strategies is required. This work presents a novel vision-based triangulation technique through an off-axis located CCD camera synchronized with a 640 nm wavelength pulsed illumination laser. Image processing and machine vision techniques allow in-line height measurement right after metal solidification. The linearity and the precision of the proposed setup are validated through off-and in-process trials in the laser metal deposition (LMD) process. Besides, the performance of the developed in-line inspection system has also been tested for the Arc based DED process and compared against experimental weld bead characterization data. In this last case, the system additionally allowed for the measurement of weld bead width and contact angles, which are critical in first runs of multilayer buildups.},

ABSTRACT = {Additive Manufacturing (AM) technologies offer the ability to construct complex geometrical structures in short manufacturing lead time coupled with a relatively low production cost when compared to traditional manufacturing processes. The next trend in mechanical engineering design is the adaption of design strategies that build products with lightweight lattice geometries like sandwich structures. These structures possess low mass, large surface area to volume ratio, high porosity, and adequate mechanical behavior, which are properties of great importance in scientific fields such as bioengineering, automotive, and aerospace engineering. The present work is focused on producing sandwich structures with complex lattice patterns like the Triply Periodic Minimal Surface (TPMS) Schwarz diamond structure. The specimens were manufactured with two different Additive Manufacturing procedures employing various relative densities. More specifically, Material Jetting Printing (MJP) and Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) processes were employed to investigate the performance of Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) lightweight lattice structures. These structures were examined using digital microscopy in order to measure the dimensional accuracy and the surface characteristics of the utilized AM technologies. Furthermore, three-point bending tests and finite elements analyses have been applied to investigate the mechanical performance of the proposed technologies and designs as well as the influence of the relative density on the Schwarz diamond TPMS structure. The experimental results demonstrate that the investigated structure possesses a remarkable performance in respect to its weight due to the specific distribution of its material in space.},

ABSTRACT = {Hybrid manufacturing is often used to describe a combination of additive and subtractive processes in the same build envelope. In this research study, hybrid manufacturing of 18Ni-300 maraging steel was investigated using a Matsuura LUMEX Avance-25 system that integrates metal additive manufacturing using laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) processing with high-speed machining. A series of benchmarking coupons were additively printed at four different power levels (160 W, 240 W, 320 W, 380 W) and with the integration of sequential machining passes after every 10 deposited layers, as well as final finishing of selected surfaces. Using non-contact three-dimensional laser scanning, inspection of the final geometry of the 18Ni-300 maraging steel coupons against the computer-aided design (CAD) model indicated the good capability of the Matsuura LUMEX Avance-25 system for net-shape manufacturing. Linear and areal roughness measurements of the surfaces showed average Ra/Sa values of 8.02–14.64 µm for the as-printed walls versus 0.32–0.80 µm for the machined walls/faces. Using Archimedes and helium (He) gas pycnometry methods, the part density was measured to be lowest for coupons produced at 160 W (relative density of 93.3–98.5%) relative to those at high power levels of 240 W to 380 W (relative density of 99.0–99.8%). This finding agreed well with the results of the porosity size distribution determined through X-ray micro-computed tomography (µCT). Evaluation of the static tensile properties indicated that the coupons manufactured at the lowest power of 160 W were ~30% lower in strength, 24% lower in stiffness, and more than 80% lower in ductility relative to higher power conditions (240 W to 380 W) due to the lower density at 160 W.},

ABSTRACT = {It is known that 3D printing can facilitate greater design flexibility in the printing of custom shapes for packaging and construction applications using biomass–fungi composite materials. The feasibility of this new method was demonstrated by a preliminary experiment, the results of which were reported in a journal publication in 2020. As a follow-up, this paper reports on an experimental study on the relationship between the mixture composition (i.e., the psyllium husk powder content) and print quality using this new method. Four mixtures were prepared by varying the amounts of psyllium husk powder (in grams) added to 400 mL of water. The ratios (g/mL) of psyllium husk powder weight (wp) over volume of water (vw) for the mixtures were 0, 1:40, 2:40, and 3:40. Each mixture also contained 100 g of biomass–fungi material and 40 g of whole wheat flour. The print quality of the samples was evaluated based on the extrudability and shape stability. The results showed that mixtures without any psyllium husk powder were not extrudable. An increase in the ratio of psyllium husk powder to water from 1:40 to 2:40 resulted in improved print quality; however, when the psyllium husk powder to water ratio was increased to 3:40, the extrudability became worse. This phenomenon was explained by analyzing the rheological properties of the mixtures.},

ABSTRACT = {Residual stresses are one of the primary causes for the failure of parts or systems in metal additive manufacturing (AM), since they easily induce crack propagation and structural distortion. Although the formation of residual stresses has been extensively studied, the core factors steering their development in AM have not been completely uncovered. To date, several strategies based on reducing the thermal gradients have been developed to mitigate the manifestation of residual stresses in AM; however, how to choose the optimal processing plan is still unclear for AM designers. In this regard, the concept of the yield temperature, related to the thermal deformation and the mechanical constraint, plays a crucial role for controlling the residual stresses, but it has not been duly investigated, and the corresponding approach to control stresses is also yet lacking. To undertake such study, a three-bar model is firstly used to illustrate the formation mechanism of the residual stress and its key causes. Next, an experimentally calibrated thermomechanical finite element model is used to analyze the sensitivity of the residual stresses to the scan pattern, preheating, energy density, and the part geometry and size, as well as the substrate constraints. Based on the numerical results obtained from this analysis, recommendations on how to minimize the residual stresses during the AM process are provided.},

ABSTRACT = {Ultra-high-strength steels (UHSS) combined with tailor-stamping technologies are increasingly being adopted in automotive body production due to crashworthiness improvements and part weight reduction, which meet safety and energy saving demands. Recently, USIBOR®2000 (37MnB5) steel has been added to the family of UHSS. This new material allows higher performance with respect to its predecessor USIBOR®1500 (22MnB5). In this work, the two steels are compared for the manufacturing of an automotive B-Pillar by press-hardening with a tailored tool tempering approach. A Finite Element (FE) model has been developed for the numerical simulation of thermomechanical cycles of the press-hardening process. The FE-simulations have been performed with the aim of obtaining soft zones in the part, by varying the quenching time and the temperature of heated tools. The effects of these parameters on the mechanical properties of the part have been experimentally evaluated thanks to hardness and tensile tests performed on specimens subjected to the numerical thermo-mechanical cycles using the Geeble-3180 physical simulator. The results show that for both UHSS, an increase in quenching time leads to a decrease in hardness up to a threshold value, which is lower for the USIBOR®1500. Moreover, higher mechanical resistance and lower elongation at break values are derived for the USIBOR®2000 steel than for USIBOR®1500 steel.},

ABSTRACT = {To better support the transition to more industrial uses of additive manufacturing, this study examined the use of an Arcam Q20+ industrial 3D printer for producing heavily nested Ti-6Al-4V parts with both in-specification (IS) and out of specification (OS) oxygen content in reused grade 5 powder chemistries. Both the OS and IS powder chemistries were evaluated to understand their impact on build integrity and on static and fatigue performance. The results from our evaluations showed that controlling the bed preheat temperature in the Q20+ to relatively low values (326–556 °C) was effective in limiting microstructural coarsening during the long build time and enabled adequate/balanced performance vis à vis the tensile strength and ductility. Overall, the tensile properties of the IS Ti-6Al-4V material in the as-built and machined states fully met the requirements of ASTM F2924-14. By contrast, the ductility was compromised at oxygen levels above 0.2 wt.% (OS) in Ti-6Al-4V produced by EBM. Removal of the surface layer by machining increased the consistency and performance of the IS and OS Ti-6Al-4V materials. The fatigue behaviour of the EBM Ti-6Al-4V material was in the range of properties produced by casting. Due to the strong influence of both the surface finish and oxygen content on the fatigue strength, the IS Ti-6Al-4V material exhibited the highest performance, with results that were in the range of parts that had been cast plus hot isostatically pressed.},

ABSTRACT = {Pallet racking is a fundamental component within the manufacturing, storage, and distribution centers of companies around the World. It requires continuous inspection and maintenance to guarantee the protection of stock and the safety of personnel. At present, racking inspection is manually carried out by certified inspectors, leading to operational down-time, inspection costs and missed damage due to human error. As companies transition toward smart manufacturing, we present an autonomous racking inspection mechanism using a MobileNetV2-SSD architecture. We propose a solution that is affixed to the adjustable cage of a forklift truck, enabling adequate coverage of racking in the immediate vicinity. Our proposed approach leads to a classifier that is optimized for deployment onto edge devices, providing real-time alerts of damage to forklift drivers, with a mean average precision of 92.7%.},

ABSTRACT = {Dimensional accuracy and geometric characteristics of the manufactured parts bear significant importance in product assembly. In Rapid Investment Casting, these characteristics can be affected by the printing parameters of the Additive Manufacturing method used in the pattern production process. Stereolithography is one of the important AM techniques mostly exploited in RIC due to its accuracy, smooth surface, and precision. However, the effect of SLA printing parameters on the dimensional accuracy and geometric characteristics have not been studied thoroughly. This study considers an experimental approach to study the effect of SLA printing parameters such as layer thickness, build angle, support structure density, and support touchpoint size on the dimensional accuracy and geometrical characteristics of the Castable Wax printed patterns and the Al cast parts. Taguchi’s Design of Experiment was used to define the number of experimental runs. SolidCast simulation was used to design the orientation of casting feeder to achieve directional solidification. Coordinate Measuring Machine measurements of deviations in the printed and cast parts were analyzed using the “Smaller-the-better” scheme in the two-step optimization method of Taguchi experiments. Build angle and Layer thickness were identified to be the first and the second most impactful parameters, respectively, affecting both the dimensional and geometric accuracy of Castable Wax patterns and Al cast parts, with optimal values of 0 deg and 0.25 μm, respectively. Both printed and cast parts had twice as many deviations in geometry as in dimensions. The sphere roundness and angularity were found to be the most and least accurate geometric characteristics, respectively. The dimensions in the Z direction were more accurate than in the X-Y directions, showing the smallest size deviations for height measurements and large deviations in the length, width, and diameter of the hole.},
