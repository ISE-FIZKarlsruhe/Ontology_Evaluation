ABSTRACT = {The polymer nanocomposite used in this work comprises elastomer poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) as a polymer matrix and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) as a conductive nanofiller. To achieve uniform distribution of carbon nanotubes within the polymer, an optimized dispersion process was developed, featuring a strong organic solvent—chloroform, which dissolved PDMS base polymer easily and allowed high quality dispersion of MWCNTs. At concentrations as high as 9 wt.%, MWCNTs were dispersed uniformly through the polymer matrix, which presented a major improvement over prior techniques. The dispersion procedure was optimized via extended experimentation, which is discussed in detail.},

ABSTRACT = {Gold and silver nanoparticles (NPs) were prepared in water, acetonitrile and isopropanol by laser ablation methodologies. The average characteristic (longer) size of the NPs obtained ranged from 3 to 70 nm. 4-Aminobenzebethiol (4-ABT) was chosen as the surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) probe molecule to determine the optimum irradiation time and the pH of aqueous synthesis of the laser ablation-based synthesis of metallic NPs. The synthesized NPs were used to evaluate their capacity as substrates for developing more analytical applications based on SERS measurements. A highly energetic material, TNT, was used as the target compound in the SERS experiments. The Raman spectra were measured with a Raman microspectrometer. The results demonstrate that gold and silver NP substrates fabricated by the methods developed show promising results for SERS-based studies and could lead to the development of micro sensors.},

ABSTRACT = {ZnO nanomaterials with different shapes were synthesized, characterized and tested in the selective monitoring of low concentration of CO and NO2 in air. ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) and nanofibers (NFs) were synthesized by a modified sol-gel method in supercritical conditions and electrospinning technique, respectively. CO and NO2 sensing tests have demonstrated that the annealing temperature and shape of zinc oxide nanomaterials are the key factors in modulating the electrical and sensing properties. Specifically, ZnO NPs annealed at high temperature (700 °C) have been found sensitive to CO, while they displayed negligible response to NO2. The opposite behavior has been registered for the one-dimensional ZnO NFs annealed at medium temperature (400 °C). Due to their adaptable sensitivity/selectivity characteristics, the developed sensors show promising applications in dual air quality control systems for closed ambient such as automotive cabin, parking garage and tunnels.},

ABSTRACT = {Concerns about nanotechnology have prompted studies on how the release of these engineered nanoparticles impact our environment. Herein, the impact of 20 nm silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) on the life history traits of Arabidopsis thaliana was studied in both above- and below-ground parts, at macroscopic and microscopic scales. Both gross phenotypes (in contrast to microscopic phenotypes) and routes of transport and accumulation were investigated from roots to shoots. Wild type Arabidopsis growing in soil, regularly irrigated with 75 μg/L of AgNPs, did not show any obvious morphological change. However, their vegetative development was prolonged by two to three days and their reproductive growth shortened by three to four days. In addition, the germination rates of offspring decreased drastically over three generations. These findings confirmed that AgNPs induce abiotic stress and cause reproductive toxicity in Arabidopsis. To trace transport of AgNPs, this study also included an Arabidopsis reporter line genetically transformed with a green fluorescent protein and grown in an optical transparent medium with 75 μg/L AgNPs. AgNPs followed three routes: (1) At seven days after planting (DAP) at S1.0 (stages defined by Boyes et al. 2001 [41]), AgNPs attached to the surface of primary roots and then entered their root tips; (2) At 14 DAP at S1.04, as primary roots grew longer, AgNPs gradually moved into roots and entered new lateral root primordia and root hairs; (3) At 17 DAP at S1.06 when the Arabidopsis root system had developed multiple lateral roots, AgNPs were present in vascular tissue and throughout the whole plant from root to shoot. In some cases, if cotyledons of the Arabidopsis seedlings were immersed in melted transparent medium, then AgNPs were taken up by and accumulated in stomatal guard cells. These findings in Arabidopsis are the first to document specific routes and rates of AgNP uptake in vivo and in situ.},

ABSTRACT = {Cysteine-functionalized chitosan magnetic nano-based particles were synthesized for the sorption of light and heavy rare earth (RE) metal ions (La(III), Nd(III) and Yb(III)). The structural, surface, and magnetic properties of nano-sized sorbent were investigated by elemental analysis, FTIR, XRD, TEM and VSM (vibrating sample magnetometry). Experimental data show that the pseudo second-order rate equation fits the kinetic profiles well, while sorption isotherms are described by the Langmuir model. Thermodynamic constants (ΔG°, ΔH°) demonstrate the spontaneous and endothermic nature of sorption. Yb(III) (heavy RE) was selectively sorbed while light RE metal ions La(III) and Nd(III) were concentrated/enriched in the solution. Cationic species RE(III) in aqueous solution can be adsorbed by the combination of chelating and anion-exchange mechanisms. The sorbent can be efficiently regenerated using acidified thiourea.},

ABSTRACT = {Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have been widely used in industry due to their unique physical and chemical properties. However, AgNPs have caused environmental concerns. To understand the risks of AgNPs, Arabidopsis microarray data for AgNP, Ag+, cold, salt, heat and drought stresses were analyzed. Up- and down-regulated genes of more than two-fold expression change were compared, while the encoded proteins of shared and unique genes between stresses were subjected to differential enrichment analyses. AgNPs affected the fewest genes (575) in the Arabidopsis genome, followed by Ag+ (1010), heat (1374), drought (1435), salt (4133) and cold (6536). More genes were up-regulated than down-regulated in AgNPs and Ag+ (438 and 780, respectively) while cold down-regulated the most genes (4022). Responses to AgNPs were more similar to those of Ag+ (464 shared genes), cold (202), and salt (163) than to drought (50) or heat (30); the genes in the first four stresses were enriched with 32 PFAM domains and 44 InterPro protein classes. Moreover, 111 genes were unique in AgNPs and they were enriched in three biological functions: response to fungal infection, anion transport, and cell wall/plasma membrane related. Despite shared similarity to Ag+, cold and salt stresses, AgNPs are a new stressor to Arabidopsis.},

The synthesized Ag@α-Fe2O3 nanocomposite has been characterized by various techniques, such as SEM, TEM and UV-Vis spectroscopy. The electrical and gas sensing properties of the synthesized composite towards low concentrations of ethanol have been evaluated. The Ag@α-Fe2O3 nanocomposite showed better sensing characteristics than the pure α-Fe2O3. The peculiar hierarchical nano-architecture and the chemical and electronic sensitization effect of Ag nanoparticles in Ag@α-Fe2O3 sensors were postulated to play a key role in modulating gas-sensing properties in comparison to pristine α-Fe2O3 sensors.},

ABSTRACT = {A new method of graphene oxide (GO) synthesis via single-step reforming of sugarcane bagasse agricultural waste by oxidation under muffled atmosphere conditions is reported. The strong and sharp X-ray diffraction peak at 2θ = 11.6° corresponds to an interlayer distance of 0.788 nm (d002) for the AB stacked GOs. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) confirm the formation of the GO layer structure and the hexagonal framework. This is a promising method for fast and effective synthesis of GO from sugarcane bagasse intended for a variety of energy and environmental applications.},

ABSTRACT = {Ag nanoparticles were synthesized by using Ficus altissima Blume leaf extract as a reducing agent at room temperature. The resulting Ag nanoparticles/PVA mixture was employed to create Ag nanoparticles/PVA (polyvinyl alcohol) hybrid nanofibers via an electrospinning technique. The obtained nanofibers were confirmed by means of UV-Vis spectroscopy, The X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and then tested to catalyze KBH4 reduction of methylene blue (MB). The catalytic results demonstrate that the MB can be reduced completely within 15 min. In addition, the Ag nanoparticles/PVA hybrid nanofibers show reusability for three cycles with no obvious losses in degradation ratio of the MB.},

ABSTRACT = {In this study, the effect of nanoparticle concentration was tested for both CuO and TiO2 in eutectic mixture of sodium and potassium nitrate. Results showed an enhancement in specific heat capacity (Cp) for both types of nanoparticles (+10.48% at 440 °C for 0.1 wt % CuO and +4.95% at 440 °C for 0.5 wt % TiO2) but the behavior toward a rise in concentration was different with CuO displaying its highest enhancement at the lowest concentration whilst TiO2 showed no concentration dependence for three of the four different concentrations tested. The production of cluster of nanoparticles was visible in CuO but not in TiO2. This formation of nanostructure in molten salt might promote the enhancement in Cp. However, the size and shape of these structures will most likely impact the energy density of the molten salt.},

ABSTRACT = {Enteric bacterial human pathogens, i.e., Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis and Klebsiella pneumoniae, are the major cause of diarrheal infections in children and adults. Their structure badly affects the human immune system. It is important to explore new antibacterial agents instead of antibiotics for treatment. This project is an attempt to explain how gold nanoparticles affect these bacteria. We investigated the important role of the mean particle size, and the inhibition of a bacterium is dose-dependent. Ultra Violet (UV)-visible spectroscopy revealed the size of chemically synthesized gold nanoparticle as 6–40 nm. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) analysis confirmed the size and X-ray diffractometry (XRD) analysis determined the polycrystalline nature of gold nanoparticles. The present findings explained how gold nanoparticles lyse Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria.},

ABSTRACT = {Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) of different shapes and sizes were prepared by solution-based chemical reduction routes. Silver nitrate was used as a precursor, tri-sodium citrate (TSC) and sodium borohydride as reducing agents, while polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) was used as a stabilizing agent. The morphology, size, and structural properties of obtained nanoparticles were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), UV-visible spectroscopy (UV-VIS), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques. Spherical AgNPs, as depicted by SEM, were found to have diameters in the range of 15 to 90 nm while lengths of the edges of the triangular particles were about 150 nm. The characteristic surface plasmon resonance (SPR) peaks of different spherical silver colloids occurring in the wavelength range of 397 to 504 nm, whereas triangular particles showed two peaks, first at 392 nm and second at 789 nm as measured by UV-VIS. The XRD spectra of the prepared samples indicated the face-centered cubic crystalline structure of metallic AgNPs. The in vitro antibacterial properties of all synthesized AgNPs against two types of Gram-negative bacteria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli were examined by Kirby–Bauer disk diffusion susceptibility method. It was noticed that the smallest-sized spherical AgNPs demonstrated a better antibacterial activity against both bacterial strains as compared to the triangular and larger spherical shaped AgNPs.},

ABSTRACT = {Human serum albumin nanoparticles (HSA-NPs) are widely-used drug delivery systems with applications in various diseases, like cancer. For intravenous administration of HSA-NPs, the particle size, surface charge, drug loading and in vitro release kinetics are important parameters for consideration. This study focuses on the development of stable HSA-NPs containing the anti-cancer drug paclitaxel (PTX) via the emulsion-solvent evaporation method using a high-pressure homogenizer. The key parameters for the preparation of PTX-HSA-NPs are: the starting concentrations of HSA, PTX and the organic solvent, including the homogenization pressure and its number cycles, were optimized. Results indicate a size of 143.4 ± 0.7 nm and 170.2 ± 1.4 nm with a surface charge of −5.6 ± 0.8 mV and −17.4 ± 0.5 mV for HSA-NPs and PTX-HSA-NPs (0.5 mg/mL of PTX), respectively. The yield of the PTX-HSA-NPs was ~93% with an encapsulation efficiency of ~82%. To investigate the safety and effectiveness of the PTX-HSA-NPs, an in vitro drug release and cytotoxicity assay was performed on human breast cancer cell line (MCF-7). The PTX-HSA-NPs showed dose-dependent toxicity on cells of 52%, 39.3% and 22.6% with increasing concentrations of PTX at 8, 20.2 and 31.4 μg/mL, respectively. In summary, all parameters involved in HSA-NPs’ preparation, its anticancer efficacy and scale-up are outlined in this research article.},

ABSTRACT = {Nanotechnology-based pesticide formulations would ensure effective utilization of agricultural inputs. In the present work, mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) with particle diameters of ~110 nm and pore sizes of ~3.7 nm were synthesized via a liquid crystal templating mechanism. A water-soluble chitosan (CS) derivative (N-(2-hydroxyl)propyl-3-trimethyl ammonium CS chloride, HTCC) was successfully capped on the surface of pyraclostrobin-loaded MSNs. The physicochemical and structural analyses showed that the electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonding were the major forces responsible for the formation of HTCC-capped MSNs. HTCC coating greatly improved the loading efficiency (LC) (to 40.3%) compared to using bare MSNs as a single encapsulant (26.7%). The microstructure of the nanoparticles was revealed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The pyraclostrobin-loaded nanoparticles showed an initial burst and subsequent sustained release behavior. HTCC-capped MSNs released faster than bare MSNs in the initial stage. Pyraclostrobin-loaded HTCC-capped MSNs with half doses of pyraclostrobin technical demonstrated almost the same fungicidal activity against Phomopsis asparagi (Sacc.), which obviously reduced the applied pesticide and enhanced the utilization efficiency. Therefore, HTCC-decorated MSNs demonstrated great potential as nanocarriers in agrochemical applications.},

ABSTRACT = {Graphitic-C3N4 nanosheets (CN)/ZnO photocatalysts (CN/ZnO) with different CN loadings were successfully prepared via a simple precipitation-calcination in the presence of exfoliated C3N4 nanosheets. Their morphology and structure were thoroughly characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) and photoluminescence spectra (PL). The results showed that hexagonal wurzite-phase ZnO nanoparticles were randomly distributed onto the CN nanosheets with a well-bonded interface between the two components in the CN/ZnO composites. The performance of the photocatalytic Cr(VI) reduction indicated that CN/ZnO exhibited better photocatalytic activity than pure ZnO under visible-light irradiation and the photocatalyst composite with a lower loading of CN sheets eventually displayed higher activity. The enhanced performance of CN/ZnO photocatalysts could be ascribed to the increased absorption of the visible light and the effective transfer and separation of the photogenerated charge carriers.},

ABSTRACT = {In this work, graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) were dispersed uniformly in aqueous solution using methylcellulose (MC) as a dispersing agent via ultrasonic processing. Homogenous GNP suspensions were incorporated into the cement matrix to investigate the effect of GNPs on the mechanical behavior of cement paste. The optimum concentration ratio of GNPs to MC was confirmed as 1:7 by ultraviolet visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis), and the optical microscope and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images displayed remarkable dispersing performance. The GNP–cement composite exhibited better mechanical properties with the help of surface-modified GNPs. The flexural strength of cement paste increased up to 15%–24% with 0.05 wt % GNPs (by weight of cement). Meanwhile, the compressive strength of the GNP–cement composite increased up to 3%–8%. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) and thermal analysis (TG/DTG) demonstrated that the GNPs could accelerate the degree of hydration and increase the amount of hydration products, especially at an early age. Meanwhile, the lower porosity and finer pore size distribution of GNP–cement composite were detected by mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP). In addition, scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis showed the introduction of GNPs could impede the development of cracks and preserve the completeness of the matrix through the plicate morphology and tortuous behavior of GNPs.},

In this study, facile, ecofriendly synthesis of copper oxide (CuO) nanoparticles was successfully achieved using aqueous extract of Pterospermum acerifolium leaves. P. acerifolium-fabricated CuO nanoparticles were further characterized by UV-Visible spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), energy dispersive X-ray (EDX), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and dynamic light scattering (DLS). Plant-mediated CuO nanoparticles were found to be oval shaped and well dispersed in suspension. XPS confirmed the elemental composition of P. acerifolium-mediated copper nanoparticles as comprised purely of copper and oxygen. DLS measurements and ion release profile showed that P. acerifolium-mediated copper nanoparticles were more stable than the engineered CuO NPs. Copper oxide nanoparticles are used in many applications; therefore, their potential toxicity cannot be ignored. A comparative study was performed to investigate the bio-toxic impacts of plant-synthesized and engineered CuO nanoparticles on water flea Daphnia. Experiments were conducted to investigate the 48-h acute toxicity of engineered CuO NPs and plant-synthesized nanoparticles. Lower EC50 value 0.102 ± 0.019 mg/L was observed for engineered CuO NPs, while 0.69 ± 0.226 mg/L was observed for plant-synthesized CuO NPs. Additionally, ion release from CuO nanoparticles and 48-h accumulation of these nano CuOs in daphnids were also calculated. Our findings thus suggest that the contribution of released ions from nanoparticles and particles/ions accumulation in Daphnia needs to be interpreted with care.},

ABSTRACT = {Green synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) has gained great interest as a simple and eco-friendly alternative to conventional chemical methods. In this study, AgNPs were synthesized by using extracts of marine algae Ecklonia cava as reducing and capping agents. The formation of AgNPs using aqueous extract of Ecklonia cava was confirmed visually by color change and their surface plasmon resonance peak at 418 nm, measured by UV-visible spectroscopy. The size, shape, and morphology of the biosynthesized AgNPs were observed by transmission electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering analysis. The biosynthesized AgNPs were nearly spherical in shape with an average size around 43 nm. Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis confirmed the presence of phenolic compounds in the aqueous extract of Ecklonia cava as reducing and capping agents. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was also carried out to demonstrate the crystalline nature of the biosynthesized AgNPs. Antimicrobial results determined by an agar well diffusion assay demonstrated a significant antibacterial activity of the AgNPs against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. Antioxidant results determined by 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging assay revealed an efficient antioxidant activity of the biosynthesized AgNPs. The biosynthesized AgNPs also exhibited a strong apoptotic anticancer activity against human cervical cancer cells. Our findings demonstrate that aqueous extract of Ecklonia cava is an effective reducing agent for green synthesis of AgNPs with efficient antimicrobial, antioxidant, and anticancer activities.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper systematically studied the modification of cement-based materials by nano-SiO2 particles with an average diameter of about 20 nm. In order to obtain the effect of nano-SiO2 particles on the mechanical properties, hydration, and pore structure of cement-based materials, adding 1%, 3%, and 5% content of nano-SiO2 in cement paste, respectively. The results showed that the reaction of nano-SiO2 particles with Ca(OH)2 (crystal powder) started within 1 h, and formed C–S–H gel. The reaction speed was faster after aging for three days. The mechanical properties of cement-based materials were improved with the addition of 3% nano-SiO2, and the early strength enhancement of test pieces was obvious. Three-day compressive strength increased 33.2%, and 28-day compressive strength increased 18.5%. The exothermic peak of hydration heat of cement increased significantly after the addition of nano-SiO2. Appearance time of the exothermic peak was advanced and the total heat release increased. Thermogravimetric-differential scanning calorimetry (TG-DSC) analysis showed that nano-SiO2 promoted the formation of C–S–H gel. The results of mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP) showed that the total porosity of cement paste with 3% nano-SiO2 was reduced by 5.51% and 5.4% at three days and 28 days, respectively, compared with the pure cement paste. At the same time, the pore structure of cement paste was optimized, and much-detrimental pores and detrimental pores decreased, while less harmful pores and innocuous pores increased.},

ABSTRACT = {In this research, ZnO nanowires doped with Mn2+ and Co2+ ions were synthesized through a facile and inexpensive hydrothermal approach, in which Mn2+ and Co2+ ions successfully substituted Zn2+ in the ZnO crystal lattice without changing the morphology and crystalline structure of ZnO. The atomic percentages of Mn and Co were 6.29% and 1.68%, respectively, in the doped ZnO nanowires. The photocatalytic results showed that Mn-doped and Co-doped ZnO nanowires both exhibited higher photocatalytic activities than undoped ZnO nanowires. Among the doped ZnO nanowires, Co-doped ZnO, which owns a twice active visible-light photocatalytic performance compared to pure ZnO, is considered a more efficient photocatalyst material. The enhancement of its photocatalytic performance originates from the doped metal ions, which enhance the light absorption ability and inhibit the recombination of photo-generated electron-hole pairs as well. The effect of the doped ion types on the morphology, crystal lattice and other properties of ZnO was also investigated.},

ABSTRACT = {In this work, the effect of graphene oxide nanosheet (GONS) additives on the properties of cement mortar and ultra-high strength concrete (UHSC) is reported. The resulting GONS-cement composites were easy to prepare and exhibited excellent mechanical properties. However, their fluidity decreased with increasing GONS content. The UHSC specimens were prepared with various amounts of GONSs (0–0.03% by weight of cement). Results indicated that using 0.01% by weight of cement GONSs caused a 7.82% in compressive strength after 28 days of curing. Moreover, adding GONSs improved the flexural strength and deformation ability, with the increase in flexural strength more than that of compressive strength. Furthermore, field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) was used to observe the morphology of the hardened cement paste and UHSC samples. FE-SEM observations showed that the GONSs were well dispersed in the matrix and the bonding of the GONSs and the surrounding cement matrix was strong. Furthermore, FE-SEM observation indicated that the GONSs probably affected the shape of the cement hydration products. However, the growth space for hydrates also had an important effect on the morphology of hydrates. The true hydration mechanism of cement composites with GONSs needs further study.},

ABSTRACT = {Hollow halloysite nanotubes have been used as nanocontainers for loading and for the triggered release of calcium hydroxide for paper preservation. A strategy for placing end-stoppers into the tubular nanocontainer is proposed and the sustained release from the cavity is reported. The incorporation of Ca(OH)2 into the nanotube lumen, as demonstrated using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging and Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) mapping, retards the carbonatation, delaying the reaction with CO2 gas. This effect can be further controlled by placing the end-stoppers. The obtained material is tested for paper deacidification. We prove that adding halloysite filled with Ca(OH)2 to paper can reduce the impact of acid exposure on both the mechanical performance and pH alteration. The end-stoppers have a double effect: they preserve the calcium hydroxide from carbonation, and they prevent from the formation of highly basic pH and trigger the response to acid exposure minimizing the pH drop-down. These features are promising for a composite nanoadditive in the smart protection of cellulose-based materials.},

ABSTRACT = {Nickel oxide is one of the highly promising semiconducting materials, but its large band gap (3.7 to 4 eV) limits its use in practical applications. Here we report the effect of nickel/oxygen vacancies and interstitial defects on the near-band-edge (NBE) and deep-level-emission (DLE) in various sizes of nickel oxide (NiO) nanoparticles. The ultraviolet (UV) emission originated from excitonic recombination corresponding near-band-edge (NBE) transition of NiO, while deep-level-emission (DLE) in the visible region due to various structural defects such as oxygen vacancies and interstitial defects. We found that the NiO nanoparticles exhibit a strong green band emission around ~2.37 eV in all samples, covering 80% integrated intensity of PL spectra. This apparently anomalous phenomenon is attributed to photogenerated holes trapped in the deep level oxygen vacancy recombining with the electrons trapped in a shallow level located just below the conducting band.},

ABSTRACT = {In this research, we report the size-controlled synthesis and surface-functionalization of magnetite with the natural antioxidant gallic acid (GA) as a ligand, using in situ and post-synthesis methods. GA functionalization provided narrow size distribution, with an average particle size of 5 and 8 nm for in situ synthesis of gallic acid functionalized magnetite IONP@GA1 and IONP@GA2, respectively, which are ultra-small particles as compared to unfunctionalized magnetite (IONP) and post functionalized magnetite IONP@GA3 with average size of 10 and 11 nm respectively. All the IONPs@GA samples were found hydrophilic with stable aggregation state. Prior to commencement of experimental lab work, PASS software was used to predict the biological activities of GA and it is found that experimental antioxidant activity using 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay and antimicrobial studies using well diffusion method are in good agreement with the simulated results. Furthermore, the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of DPPH antioxidant assay revealed a 2–4 fold decrease as compared to unfunctionalized IONP. In addition to antioxidant activity, all the three IONP@GA proved outstanding antimicrobial activity while testing on different bacterial and fungal strains. The results collectively indicate the successful fabrication of novel antioxidant, antimicrobial IONP@GA composite, which are magnetically separable, efficient, and low cost, with potential applications in polymers, cosmetics, and biomedical and food industries.},

ABSTRACT = {Many studies have shown the effect of solution chemistry on the environmental behavior of metal-based nanoparticles (NPs), except CuO NPs. Here, we investigated the agglomeration, sedimentation, dissolution, and speciation of CuO NPs by varying pH, ionic strength, ionic valence, and natural organic matter (NOM). The results showed that as the pH moved away from 6, the size of CuO agglomerates decreased, along with the enhanced NP suspension stabilization, due to the increase of electrostatic repulsive force. Increasing ionic strength and valence intensified the agglomeration and sedimentation of CuO NPs because of the compression of electrical double layers. The presence of humic acid and citric acid enhanced the dispersion and stabilization of CuO NP suspension, but l-cysteine showed a different impact. Decreasing pH, increasing ionic strength and all NOM improved the dissolution of CuO NPs, but the divalent electrolyte (CaCl2) inhibited the Cu2+ release from CuO NPs compared to the monovalent electrolyte (NaCl). In addition, X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) analysis demonstrated that the presence of l-cysteine transformed more than 30% of CuO NPs to Cu(I)-cysteine by coordinating with thiol group. This study can give us an in-depth understanding on the environmental behavior and fate of CuO NPs in the aquatic environment.},

ABSTRACT = {Targeting cancer cells without injuring normal cells is the prime objective in treatment of cancer. In this present study, solvothermal and wet chemical precipitation techniques were employed to synthesize iron oxide (IO), hydroxyapatite (HAp), and hydroxyapatite coated iron oxide (IO-HAp) nanoparticles for magnetic hyperthermia mediated cancer therapy. The synthesized well dispersed spherical IO-HAp nanoparticles, magnetite, and apatite phases were confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and Field emission transmission electron microscopy (FETEM) with Energy Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The non-toxic behavior of synthesized IO-HAp nanoparticles was confirmed by cytotoxicity assay (Trypan blue and MTT assay). The synthesized nanoparticles revealed a remarkable magnetic saturation of 83.2 emu/g for IO and 40.6 emu/g for IO-HAp nanoparticles in presence of 15,000 Oe (1.5 T) magnetic field at room temperature (300 K). The magnetic hyperthermia study that was performed with IO-HAp nanoparticles showed an excellent hyperthermia effect (SAR value 85 W/g) over MG-63 osteosarcoma cells. The in vitro hyperthermia temperature (~45 °C) was reached within 3 min, which shows a very high efficiency and kills nearly all of the experimental MG-63 osteosarcoma cells within 30 min exposure. These results could potentially open new perceptions for biomaterials that are aimed for anti-cancer therapies based on magnetic hyperthermia.},

ABSTRACT = {In this work, copper (Cu) nanoparticles with observable surface plasmonic resonance (SPR) peaks were synthesized by an in-situ method. Chitosan host polymer was used as a reduction medium and a capping agent for the Cu nanoparticles. The surface morphology of the samples was investigated through the use of scanning electron micrograph (SEM) technique. Copper nanoparticles appeared as chains and white specks in the SEM images. The strong peaks due to the Cu element observed in the spectrum of energy dispersive analysis of X-rays. For the nanocomposite samples, obvious peaks due to the SPR phenomena were obtained in the Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectra. The effect of Cu nanoparticles on the host band gap was understood from absorption edges shifting of absorption edges to lower photon energy. The optical dielectric loss parameter obtained from the measurable quantities was used as an alternative method to study the band structure of the samples. Quantum mechanical models drawbacks, in the study of band gap, were explained based on the optical dielectric loss. A clear dispersion region was able to be observed in refractive indices spectra of the composite samples. A linear relationship with a regression value of 0.99 was achieved between the refractive index and volume fractions of CuI content. Cu nanoparticles with various sizes and homogenous dispersions were also determined from transmission electron microscope (TEM) images.},

ABSTRACT = {The design and self-assembly of graphene oxide (GO)-based composite membranes have attracted enormous attention due to their wide application in nanomaterial and environmental fields. In this work, we have successfully developed a strategy to fabricate new composite membranes based on poly(vinyl alcohol)/poly(acrylic acid)/carboxyl-functionalized graphene oxide modified with silver nanoparticles (PVA/PAA/GO-COOH@AgNPs), which were prepared via thermal treatment and the electrospinning technique. Due to the strong π-π forces and strong electrostatic interactions of GO–COOH sheets, the prepared composite membranes and their lager surface areas were modified by scores of AgNPs, which demonstrated that a high-efficiency photocatalyst removed the organic dyes from the aqueous solutions. The prepared PVA/PAA/GO-COOH@AgNPs nanocomposite membranes showed a remarkable photocatalytic capacity in the catalytic degradation of the methylene blue dye solutions. Most importantly, the whole process was easy, mild, and eco-friendly. Additionally, the as-prepared membranes could be repeatedly used after the catalytic reaction.},

ABSTRACT = {Composite acrylonitrile–butadiene–styrene (ABS)/carbon nanotubes (CNT) filaments at 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 wt %, suitable for fused deposition modelling (FDM) were obtained by using a completely solvent-free process based on direct melt compounding and extrusion. The optimal CNT content in the filaments for FDM was found to be 6 wt %; for this composite, a detailed investigation of the thermal, mechanical and electrical properties was performed. Presence of CNT in ABS filaments and 3D-printed parts resulted in a significant enhancement of the tensile modulus and strength, accompanied by a reduction of the elongation at break. As documented by dynamic mechanical thermal analysis, the stiffening effect of CNTs in ABS is particularly pronounced at high temperatures. Besides, the presence of CNT in 3D-printed parts accounts for better creep and thermal dimensional stabilities of 3D-printed parts, accompanied by a reduction of the coefficient of thermal expansion). 3D-printed nanocomposite samples with 6 wt % of CNT exhibited a good electrical conductivity, even if lower than pristine composite filaments.},

UV-Vis and FTIR results indicated that the obtained products were mainly spherical in shape, and that the phenolic hydroxyl of proanthocyanidins had strong interactions with the gold surface.

The application of proanthocyanidins-functionalized gold nanoparticles for the removal of dyes and heavy metal ions Ni2+, Cu2+, Cd2+ and Pb2+ in an aqueous solution was investigated.

Herein, a GO/Ti3C2Tx nanocomposite was prepared by a simple liquid phase method, and the obtained GO/Ti3C2Tx was transformed into RGO/Ti3C2Tx under high temperature with Ar/H2. The prepared samples were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman measurement, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy disperse spectroscopy (EDS), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). As an electrode material in lithium-ion batteries, the RGO/Ti3C2Tx nanocomposite exhibited an excellent electrochemical performance and an excellent rate performance. Compared to pure Ti3C2Tx, the nanocomposite had a better reversible capacity at different current densities and had no attenuation after 200 cycles, which is one time higher than pure Ti3C2Tx. The improvement in the specific capacity was due to the excellent electrical conductivity and the unique structure of RGO, in which a charge transfer bridge was built among the Ti3C2Tx flakes. Such a bridge shortened the transmission distance of the electrons and ions and effectively controlled the restacking of the laminated materials.},

ABSTRACT = {This study attempted to develop chitosan-based nanoparticles with increased stability and antibacterial activity. The chitosan/protamine hybrid nanoparticles were formed based on an ionic gelation method by mixing chitosan with protamine and subsequently cross-linking the mixtures with sodium tripolyphosphate (TPP). The effects of protamine on the chemical structures, physical properties, and antibacterial activities of the hybrid nanoparticles were investigated. The antibacterial experiments demonstrated that the addition of protamine (125 µg/mL) in the hybrid nanoparticles (500 µg/mL chitosan and 166.67 µg/mL TPP) improved the antimicrobial specificity with the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value of 31.25 µg/mL towards Escherichia coli (E. coli), while the MIC value was higher than 250 µg/mL towards Bacillus cereus. The chitosan/protamine hybrid nanoparticles induced the formation of biofilm-like structure in B. cereus and non-motile-like structure in E. coli. The detection of bacterial cell ruptures showed that the inclusion of protamine in the hybrid nanoparticles caused different membrane permeability compared to chitosan nanoparticles and chitosan alone. The chitosan/protamine nanoparticles also exhibited lower binding affinity towards B. cereus than E. coli. The results suggested that the hybridization of chitosan with protamine improved the antibacterial activity of chitosan nanoparticles towards pathogenic E. coli, but the inhibitory effect against probiotic B. cereus was significantly reduced.},

ABSTRACT = {Two dimensional (2D)SnO2 nanosheets were synthesized by a substrate-free hydrothermal route using sodium stannate and sodium hydroxide in a mixed solvent of absolute ethanol and deionized water at a lower temperature of 130 °C. The characterization results of the morphology, microstructure, and surface properties of the as-prepared products demonstrated that SnO2 nanosheets with a tetragonal rutile structure, were composed of oriented SnO2 nanoparticles with a diameter of 6–12 nm. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) and high-resolution transmission electron microscope (FETEM) results demonstrated that the dominant exposed surface of the SnO2 nanoparticles was (101), but not (110). The growth and formation was supposed to follow the oriented attachment mechanism. The SnO2 nanosheets exhibited an excellent sensing response toward ethylene glycol at a lower optimal operating voltage of 3.4 V. The response to 400 ppm ethylene glycol reaches 395 at 3.4 V. Even under the low concentration of 5, 10, and 20 ppm, the sensor exhibited a high response of 6.9, 7.8, and 12.0 to ethylene glycol, respectively. The response of the SnO2 nanosheets exhibited a linear dependence on the ethylene glycol concentration from 5 to 1000 ppm. The excellent sensing performance was attributed to the present SnO2 nanoparticles with small size close to the Debye length, the larger specific surface, the high-energy exposed facets of the (101) surface, and the synergistic effects of the SnO2 nanoparticles of the nanosheets.},

ABSTRACT = {Curcumin, extracted from the rhizome of Curcuma longa, has been widely used in medicine for centuries due to its anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, anti-oxidant and anti-microbial effects. However, its bioavailability during treatments is poor because of its low solubility in water, slow dissolution rate and rapid intestinal metabolism. For these reasons, improving the therapeutic efficiency of curcumin using nanocarriers (e.g., biopolymer nanoparticles) has been a research focus, to foster delivery of the curcumin inside cells due to their small size and large surface area. Silk fibroin from the Bombyx mori silkworm is a biopolymer characterized by its biocompatibility, biodegradability, amphiphilic chemistry, and excellent mechanical properties in various material formats. These features make silk fibroin nanoparticles useful vehicles for delivering therapeutic drugs, such as curcumin. Curcumin-loaded silk fibroin nanoparticles were synthesized using two procedures (physical adsorption and coprecipitation) more scalable than methods previously described using ionic liquids. The results showed that nanoparticle formulations were 155 to 170 nm in diameter with a zeta potential of approximately −45 mV. The curcumin-loaded silk fibroin nanoparticles obtained by both processing methods were cytotoxic to carcinogenic cells, while not decreasing viability of healthy cells. In the case of tumor cells, curcumin-loaded silk fibroin nanoparticles presented higher efficacy in cytotoxicity against neuroblastoma cells than hepatocarcinoma cells. In conclusion, curcumin-loaded silk fibroin nanoparticles constitute a biodegradable and biocompatible delivery system with the potential to treat tumors by local, long-term sustained drug delivery.},

ABSTRACT = {In the present paper, we use zinc oxide nanoparticles under the excitation of ultraviolet (UV) light for the generation of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), with the aim of further using these species for fighting cancer cells in vitro. Owing to the difficulties in obtaining highly dispersed nanoparticles (NPs) in biological media, we propose their coating with a double-lipidic layer and we evaluate their colloidal stability in comparison to the pristine zinc oxide NPs. Then, using Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) coupled with the spin-trapping technique, we demonstrate and characterize the ability of bare and lipid-coated ZnO NPs to generate ROS in water only when remotely actuated via UV light irradiation. Interestingly, our results reveal that the surface chemistry of the NPs greatly influences the type of photo-generated ROS. Finally, we show that lipid-coated ZnO NPs are effectively internalized inside human epithelial carcinoma cells (HeLa) via a lysosomal pathway and that they can generate ROS inside cancer cells, leading to enhanced cell death. The results are promising for the development of ZnO-based therapeutic systems.},

ABSTRACT = {(1) Background: There is a growing need for the development of new methods for the synthesis of nanoparticles. The interest in such particles has raised concerns about the environmental safety of their production methods; (2) Objectives: The current methods of nanoparticle production are often expensive and employ chemicals that are potentially harmful to the environment, which calls for the development of “greener” protocols. Herein we describe the synthesis of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) using plant extracts, which offers an alternative, efficient, inexpensive, and environmentally friendly method to produce well-defined geometries of nanoparticles; (3) Methods: The phytochemicals present in the aqueous leaf extract acted as an effective reducing agent. The generated AuNPs were characterized by Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Scanning electron microscope (SEM), and Atomic Force microscopy (AFM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV-visible spectroscopy, energy dispersive X-ray (EDX), and thermogravimetric analyses (TGA); (4) Results and Conclusions: The prepared nanoparticles were found to be biocompatible and exhibited no antimicrobial or antifungal effect, deeming the particles safe for various applications in nanomedicine. TGA analysis revealed that biomolecules, which were present in the plant extract, capped the nanoparticles and acted as stabilizing agents.},

ABSTRACT = {Amine-modified magnetite (NH2–Fe3O4)/reduced graphene oxide nanocomposite modified glassy carbon electrodes (NH2–Fe3O4/RGO/GCEs) were developed for the sensitive detection of dopamine (DA). The NH2-Fe3O4/RGO/GCEs were fabricated using a drop-casting method followed by an electrochemical reduction process. The surface morphologies, microstructure and chemical compositions of the NH2–Fe3O4 nanoparticles (NPs), reduced graphene oxide (RGO) sheets and NH2–Fe3O4/RGO nanocomposites were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-Ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The electrochemical behaviors of DA on the bare and modified GCEs were investigated in phosphate buffer solution (PBS) by cyclic voltammetry (CV). Compared with bare electrode and RGO/GCE, the oxidation peak current (ipa) on the NH2–Fe3O4/RGO/GCE increase significantly, owing to the synergistic effect between NH2–Fe3O4 NPs and RGO sheets. The oxidation peak currents (ipa) increase linearly with the concentrations of DA in the range of 1 × 10−8 mol/L – 1 × 10−7 mol/L, 1 × 10−7 mol/L – 1 × 10−6 mol/L and 1 × 10−6 mol/L – 1 × 10−5 mol/L. The detection limit is (4.0 ± 0.36) ×10−9 mol/L (S/N = 3). Moreover, the response peak currents of DA were hardly interfered with the coexistence of ascorbic acid (AA) and uric acid (UA). The proposed NH2–Fe3O4/RGO/GCE is successfully applied to the detection of dopamine hydrochloride injections with satisfactory results. Together with low cost, facile operation, good selectivity and high sensitivity, the NH2–Fe3O4/RGO/GCEs have tremendous prospects for the detection of DA in various real samples.},

ABSTRACT = {Black TiO2 has triggered worldwide research interest due to its excellent photocatalytic properties. However, the understanding of its structure–property relationships and a more effective, facile and versatile method to produce it remain great challenges. We have developed a facile approach to synthesize black TiO2 nanoparticles with significantly improved light absorption in the visible and infrared regions. The experimental results show that oxygen vacancies are the major factors responsible for black coloration. More importantly, our black TiO2 nanoparticles have no Ti3+ ions. These oxygen vacancies could introduce localized states in the bandgap and act as trap centers, significantly decreasing the electron–hole recombination. The photocatalytic decomposition of both rhodamine B and methylene blue demonstrated that, under ultraviolet light irradiation, better photocatalytic performance is achieved with our black TiO2 nanoparticles than with commercial TiO2 nanoparticles.},

ABSTRACT = {In this research, quasi-spherical-shaped zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) were synthesized by a simple cost-competitive aqueous precipitation method. The engineered NPs were characterized using several validation methodologies: UV–Vis spectroscopy, diffuse reflection UV–Vis, spectrofluorometry, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy with attenuated total reflection (ATR). A procedure was established to coat a landrace of red maize using gelatinized maize starch. Each maize seed was treated with 0.16 mg ZnO NPs (~7.7 × 109 particles). The standard germination (SG) and accelerated aging (AA) tests indicated that ZnO NP-treated maize seeds presented better physiological quality (higher percentage of normal seedlings) and sanitary quality (lower percentage of seeds contaminated by microorganisms) as compared to controls. The application of ZnO NPs also improved seedling vigor, correlated to shoot length, shoot diameter, root length, and number of secondary roots. Furthermore, shoots and roots of the ZnO NP-treated maize seeds showed a marked increment in the main active FTIR band areas, most notably for the vibrations associated with peptide-protein, lipid, lignin, polysaccharide, hemicellulose, cellulose, and carbohydrate. From these results, it is concluded that ZnO NPs have potential for applications in peasant agriculture to improve the quality of small-scale farmers’ seeds and, as a result, preserve germplasm resources.},

ABSTRACT = {The provision of nanoparticles using biogenic material as a part of green chemistry is an attractive nanotechnology. The current research aimed to test the antimicrobial and cytotoxic efficacy of silver nanoparticles synthesized by extracts of Phoenix dactylifera, Ferula asafetida, and Acacia nilotica as reductant and stabilizing agents in silver nanoparticle formation. Synthesized nanoparticles were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus (Gram-positive) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli (Gram-negative) using an agar well diffusion assay. Furthermore, cytotoxic ability was investigated against LoVo cells. The potential phyto-constituents of plant extracts were identified by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) techniques. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), and zeta potential analyzed the size and morphology of the biogenic nanoparticles. The current study revealed the ability of the tested plant extract to convert silver ions to silver nanoparticles with an average size that ranged between 67.8 ± 0.3 and 155.7 ± 1.5 nm in diameter. Biogenic AgNPs showed significant antibacterial ability (10 to 32 mm diameter) and anticancer ability against a LoVo cell with IC50 ranged between 35.15–56.73 μg/mL. The innovation of the present study is that the green synthesis of NPs, which is simple and cost effective, provides stable nano-materials and can be an alternative for the large-scale synthesis of silver nanoparticles.},

ABSTRACT = {Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) shows piezoelectricity related to its β-phase content and mechanical and electrical properties influenced by its morphology and crystallinity. Electrospinning (ES) can produce ultrafine and well-aligned PVDF nanofibers. In this study, the effects of the presence of carbon nanotubes (CNT) and optimized ES parameters on the crystal structures and piezoelectric properties of aligned PVDF/CNT nanofibrous membranes were examined. The optimal β content and piezoelectric coefficient (d33) of the aligned electrospun PVDF reached 88% and 27.4 pC/N; CNT addition increased the β-phase content to 89% and d33 to 31.3 pC/N. The output voltages of piezoelectric units with aligned electrospun PVDF/CNT membranes increased linearly with applied loading and showed good stability during cyclic dynamic compression and tension. The sensitivities of the piezoelectric units with the membranes under dynamic compression and tension were 2.26 mV/N and 4.29 mV/%, respectively. In bending tests, the output voltage increased nonlinearly with bending angle because complicated forces were involved. The output of the aligned membrane-based piezoelectric unit with CNT was 1.89 V at the bending angle of 100°. The high electric outputs indicate that the aligned electrospun PVDF/CNT membranes are potentially effective for flexible wearable sensor application with high sensitivity.},

Transmission electron microscope (TEM) analysis showed an irregular spherical shape, with an average particle size of 31 ± 2 nm. Furthermore, the synthesized ZnO NPs were tested against Aedes aegypti larvae and eggs, giving significant LC50 value of 34.04 ppm. Ovicidal activity resulted in a higher percentage mortality rate of 96.4 ± 0.24 at 120 ppm with LC50 value of 32.73 ppm.

ABSTRACT = {Nanoparticles are coated in-flight with a plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) process at ambient or elevated temperatures (up to 300 °C). Two silicon precursors, tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) and hexamethyldisiloxane (HMDSO), are used to produce inorganic silica or silica-organic shells on Pt, Au and TiO2 particles. The morphology of the coated particles is examined with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and the chemical composition is studied with Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). It is found that both the precursor and certain core materials have an influence on the coating composition, while other parameters, such as the precursor concentration, aerosol residence time and temperature, influence the morphology, but hardly the chemical composition. The coated particles are used to demonstrate simple applications, such as the modification of the surface wettability of powders and the improvement or hampering of the photocatalytic activity of titania particles.},

ABSTRACT = {The objective of the present study was one step extracellular biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) using supernatant of Candida glabrata isolated from oropharyngeal mucosa of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients and evaluation of their antibacterial and antifungal potential against human pathogenic bacteria and fungi. The mycosynthesized AgNPs were characterized by color visualization, ultraviolet-visible (UV) spectroscopy, fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The FTIR spectra revealed the binding and stabilization of nanoparticles with protein. The TEM analysis showed that nanoparticles were well dispersed and predominantly spherical in shape within the size range of 2–15 nm. The antibacterial and antifungal potential of AgNPs were characterized by determining minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC)/ minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC), and well diffusion methods. The MBC and MFC were found in the range of 62.5–250 μg/mL and 125–500 μg/mL, which revealed that bacterial strains were more susceptible to AgNPs than fungal strains. These differences in bactericidal and fungicidal concentrations of the AgNPs were due to the differences in the cell structure and organization of bacteria and yeast cells. The interaction of AgNPs with C. albicans analyzed by TEM showed the penetration of nanoparticles inside the Candida cells, which led the formation of “pits” and “pores” that result from the rupturing of the cell wall and membrane. Further, TEM analysis showed that Candida cells treated with AgNPs were highly deformed and the cells had shrunken to a greater extent because of their interaction with the fungal cell wall and membrane, which disrupted the structure of the cell membrane and inhibited the normal budding process due to the destruction and loss of membrane integrity and formation of pores that may led to the cell death.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, a Ni-doped MoS2 monolayer (Ni-MoS2) has been proposed as a novel gas adsorbent to be used in SF6-insulated equipment. Based on the first-principles calculation, the adsorption properties of Ni-MoS2 to SO2 and H2S molecules, the main decomposition components of SF6 under a partial discharge (PD) condition have been studied. The adsorption energy, charge transfer, and structural parameters have been analyzed to find the most stable gas-adsorbed Ni-MoS2. Furthermore, the density of states (DOS), projected density of states (PDOS), and electron density difference were employed to explore the interaction mechanism between SO2, H2S, and the Ni-MoS2 surface. It is found that the H2S molecule and SO2 molecule interact with the Ni-MoS2 surface by strong adsorption energy. Therefore, we conclude that the interaction between these two kinds of gases and the Ni-MoS2 monolayer belongs to chemisorption, and the Ni-MoS2 monolayer might be a promising gas adsorbent for the fault recovery of SF6-insulated equipment. Additionally, we have to point out that all of the conclusions only considered the final adsorption energy, the barrier in the transition state has not been analyzed in this paper.},

The phosphoric acid doped composite membranes display proton conductivity values that increase with increasing temperatures, maintaining their conductivity under anhydrous conditions. The addition of ZIF to the polymeric matrix enhances proton transport relative to the values observed for PBI and ZIFs alone. For example, the proton conductivity of PBI@ZIF-8 reaches 3.1 × 10−3 S·cm−1 at 200 °C and higher values were obtained for PBI@ZIF-67 membranes, with proton conductivities up to 4.1 × 10−2 S·cm−1. Interestingly, a composite membrane containing a 5 wt.% binary mixture of ZIF-8 and ZIF-67 yielded a proton conductivity of 9.2 × 10−2 S·cm−1, showing a synergistic effect on the proton conductivity.},

ABSTRACT = {A facile one-step, eco-friendly, and cost-effective approach for the formation of copper oxide (CuO) nanowires by a green method using saponin-rich Sapindus mukorossi fruit extract (SMFE). The physio-chemical characteristics of the synthesized CuO nanowires have been characterized by X-ray Diffractometry (XRD), X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), FT-IR (Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy, FE-SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy), and High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HR-TEM). Further, the electrocatalytic activity of the CuO nanowires synthesized with SMFE has been investigated, and they have been used as dopamine (DA) sensors. Because of their unique properties, the CuO nanowires/GCE exhibited remarkable electrochemical response for the detection of DA with enhanced current response. The anodic current demonstrated that the CuO nanowires/GCE linearly detects the concentration of DA over the range of 0.1 µM to 0.105 mM of DA with a regression co-efficient of 0.9960. The obtained results illustrated that the synthesized CuO nanowires can easily stimulate the electron transfer reaction between DA and the nanowires modified electrode with the improvement of the conductivity and stability of the electrode. This remarkable electrocatalytic property of CuO nanowires makes it a unique electrochemical sensor for the detection of DA. Furthermore, the sensor is free from the interference of ascorbic acid, uric acid, and other interfering species. Moreover, the anti-interference performance also showed that the CuO nanowires/GCE could be employed for the determination of DA in real samples with good selectivity and sensitivity.},

Alginate and chitosan were deposited on Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles based on their electrostatic properties. The nanoparticle size ranged from 120–200 nm, within the optimum range for drug delivery. Controllable and sustained release of curcumin was obtained by altering the number of chitosan and alginate layers on the nanoparticles. Confocal fluorescence microscopy results showed that targeted delivery of curcumin with the aid of a magnetic field was achieved. The fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) assay indicated that MDA-MB-231 cells treated with curcumin loaded nanoparticles had a 3–6 fold uptake efficiency to those treated with free curcumin. The 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-Diphenyltetrazolium Bromide (MTT) assay indicated that the curcumin loaded nanoparticles exhibited significantly higher cytotoxicity towards MDA-MB-231 cells than HDF cells. The sustained release profiles, enhanced uptake efficiency and cytotoxicity to cancer cells, as well as directed targeting make MACPs promising candidates for cancer therapy.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, we develop a technique for realizing multi-centimeter-long lithium niobate on insulator (LNOI) waveguides with a propagation loss as low as 0.027 dB/cm. Our technique relies on patterning a chromium thin film coated on the top surface of LNOI into a hard mask with a femtosecond laser followed by chemo-mechanical polishing for structuring the LNOI into the waveguides. The surface roughness on the waveguides was determined with an atomic force microscope to be 0.452 nm. The approach is compatible with other surface patterning technologies, such as optical and electron beam lithographies or laser direct writing, enabling high-throughput manufacturing of large-scale LNOI-based photonic integrated circuits.},

ABSTRACT = {In this study, we fabricated a porous calcium alginate/graphene oxide composite aerogel by using polystyrene colloidal particles as sacrificial template and graphene oxide as a reinforcing filler. Owing to the excellent metal chelation ability of calcium alginate and controlled nanosized pore structure, the as-prepared calcium alginate/graphene oxide composite aerogel (mp-CA/GO) can reach the adsorption equilibrium in 40 min, and the maximum adsorption capacity for Pb2+, Cu2+ and Cd2+ is 368.2, 98.1 and 183.6 mg/g, respectively. This is higher than most of the reported heavy metal ion sorbents. Moreover, the mp-CA/GO can be regenerated through simple acid-washing and be used repeatedly with little loss in performance. The adsorption mechanism analysis indicates that the mp-CA/GO adsorb the heavy metal ions mainly through the ion exchange and chemical coordination effects.},

ABSTRACT = {Triamcinolone acetonide (TA), an intermediate acting corticosteroid, is used in the treatment of posterior ocular diseases, such as inflammation, posterior uveitis, and diabetic macular edema. The objective of this investigation was to prepare TA-loaded solid lipid nanoparticles (TA-SLNs) and in situ gel (TA-SLN-IG) formulations for delivery into the deeper ocular tissues through the topical route. TA-SLNs were prepared by hot homogenization and ultrasonication method using glyceryl monostearate and Compritol® 888ATO as solid lipids and Tween®80 and Pluronic® F-68 as surfactants. TA-SLNs were optimized and converted to TA-SLN-IG by the inclusion of gellan gum and evaluated for their rheological properties. In vitro transcorneal permeability and in vivo ocular distribution of the TA-SLNs and TA-SLN-IG were studied using isolated rabbit corneas and New Zealand albino rabbits, respectively, and compared with TA suspension, used as control (TA-C). Particle size, PDI, zeta potential, assay, and entrapment efficiency of TA-SLNs were in the range of 200–350 nm, 0.3–0.45, −52.31 to −64.35 mV, 70–98%, and 97–99%, respectively. TA-SLN-IG with 0.3% gellan gum exhibited better rheological properties. The transcorneal permeability of TA-SLN and TA-SLN-IG was 10.2 and 9.3-folds higher compared to TA-C. TA-SLN-IG showed maximum tear concentration at 2 h, indicating an improved pre-corneal residence time, as well as higher concentrations in aqueous humor, vitreous humor and cornea at 6 h, suggesting sustained delivery of the drug into the anterior and posterior segment ocular tissues, when compared to TA-SLN and TA-C. The results, therefore, demonstrate that the lipid based nanoparticulate system combined with the in situ gelling agents can be a promising drug delivery platform for the deeper ocular tissues.},

ABSTRACT = {A new electrochemical sensor for nanomolar rutin detection based on amine-functionalized Fe3O4 nanoparticles and electrochemically reduced graphene oxide nanocomposite modified glassy carbon electrode (NH2-Fe3O4 NPs-ErGO/GCE) was fabricated through a simple method, and the X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) and electrochemical technique were used to characterize the modified electrode. The electrochemical behavior of rutin on the Fe3O4 NPs-ErGO/GCE was studied in detail. The electrochemical response of rutin at this modified electrode was remarkably higher than that of the bare GCE or other modified GCE (GO/GCE, Fe3O4 NPs-GO/GCE, and ErGO/GCE). Under the optimum determination conditions, Fe3O4 NPs-ErGO/GCE provided rutin with a broader detection range of 6.0 nM–0.1 µM; 0.1–8.0 µM and 8.0–80 µM, a minimum detectable concentration of 4.0 nM was obtained after 210 s accumulation. This novel method was applied in determination of rutin in pharmaceutical tablets and urine samples with satisfactory results.},

ABSTRACT = {MXene, a new class of two-dimensional nanomaterials, have drawn increasing attention as emerging materials for sensing applications. However, MXene-based surface plasmon resonance sensors remain largely unexplored. In this work, we theoretically show that the sensitivity of the surface plasmon resonance sensor can be significantly enhanced by combining two-dimensional Ti 3 C 2 T x MXene and transition metal dichalcogenides. A high sensitivity of 198 ∘ /RIU (refractive index unit) with a sensitivity enhancement of 41.43% was achieved in aqueous solutions (refractive index ∼1.33) with the employment of monolayer Ti 3 C 2 T x MXene and five layers of WS 2 at a 633 nm excitation wavelength. The integration of Ti 3 C 2 T x MXene with a conventional surface plasmon resonance sensor provides a promising approach for bio- and chemical sensing, thus opening up new opportunities for highly sensitive surface plasmon resonance sensors using two-dimensional nanomaterials.},

ABSTRACT = {In this work the influence of carbon nano-dots (CNDs) on absorption of ultra violet (UV) spectra in hybrid PVA based composites was studied. The FTIR results reveal the complex formation between PVA and CNDs. The shifting was observed in XRD spectrum of PVA:CNDs composites compared to pure PVA. The Debye-Scherrer formula was used to calculate the crystallite size of CNDs and crystalline phases of pure PVA and PVA:CNDs composites. The FESEM images emphasized the presence and dispersion of C-dots on the surface of the composite samples. From the images, a strong and clear absorption was noticed in the spectra. The strong absorption that appeared peaks at 280 nm and 430 nm can be ascribed to the n-π* and π-π* transitions, respectively. The absorption edge shifted to lower photon energy sides with increasing CNDs. The luminescence behavior of PVA:CNDs composite was confirmed using digital and photo luminescence (PL) measurements. The optical dielectric constant which is related to the density of states was studied and the optical band gap was characterized accurately using optical dielectric loss parameter. The Taucs model was used to determine the type of electronic transition in the samples.},

ABSTRACT = {In this work, a novel nanocomposite hydrogel based on cellulose nanocrystal (CNC) and chitosan (CS) was fabricated and applied as a carrier for the controlled delivery of theophylline. CNC was firstly periodate-oxidized to obtain dialdehyde nanocellulose (DACNC). Then, chitosan was crosslinked using DACNC as both the matrix and crosslinker in different weight ratios, to fabricate CNC/CS composites. The prepared composites were characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction pattern (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), zeta potential measurement and swelling ratio tests. FT-IR results confirmed the successful reaction between the free amino groups on chitosan and the aldehyde groups on DACNC. With the increase of chitosan percentage in the hydrogel, the isoelectric point was shifted towards an alkaline pH, which was probably caused by the higher content of free amino groups. The swelling ratio of the composite also increased, which may have been due to the decrease of crosslinking density. Because the swelling ratio of the drug-loaded hydrogels differed under varied pH values, the cumulative drug release percentage of the composite hydrogel was achieved to approximately 85% and 23% in the gastric (pH 1.5) and intestinal (pH 7.4) fluids, respectively. Therefore, CNC/CS hydrogel has application potential as a theophylline carrier.},

In this work, biocompatible, photostable, and sustainably sourced CQDs were synthesized from byproducts derived from a biorefinery process using one-pot hydrothermal treatment. The main components of byproducts were the degradation products (autohydrolyzate) of biomass pretreated by autohydrolysis. The as-synthesized CQDs had a size distribution from 2.0–6.0 nm and had high percentage of sp2 and sp3 carbon groups. The CQDs showed blue-green fluorescence with a quantum yield of ~13%, and the fluorescence behaviors were found to be stable with strong resistance to photobleaching and temperature change. In addition, it is found that the as-synthesized CQDs could be used for imaging of cells and tumors, which show potential applications in bioimaging and related fields such as phototherapy and imaging.},

ABSTRACT = {Z-scheme Ag2S/BiFeO3 heterojunction composites were successfully prepared through a precipitation method. The morphology and microstructure characterization demonstrate that Ag2S nanoparticles (30–50 nm) are well-decorated on the surfaces of polyhedral BiFeO3 particles (500–800 nm) to form Ag2S/BiFeO3 heterojunctions. The photocatalytic and photo-Fenton catalytic activities of the as-derived Ag2S/BiFeO3 heterojunction composites were evaluated by the degradation of methyl orange (MO) under visible-light irradiation. The photocatalytic result indicates that the Ag2S/BiFeO3 composites exhibit much improved photocatalytic activities when compared with bare Ag2S and BiFeO3. The optimum composite sample was observed to be 15% Ag2S/BiFeO3 with an Ag2S mass fraction of 15%. Furthermore, the addition of H2O2 can further enhance the dye degradation efficiency, which is due to the synergistic effects of photo- and Fenton catalysis. The results of photoelectrochemical and photoluminescence measurements suggest a greater separation of the photoexcited electron/hole pairs in the Ag2S/BiFeO3 composites. According to the active species trapping experiments, the photocatalytic and photo-Fenton catalytic mechanisms of the Ag2S/BiFeO3 composites were proposed and discussed.},

ABSTRACT = {4-nitrophenol (4-NP) is a hazardous waste and a priority toxic pollutant identified by US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Hence, in this paper, a voltammetric sensor was proposed for the direct and sensitive detection of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) at nanomolar level in complex matrices by using graphene and acetylene black paste hybridized electrode (GR/ABPE). Under optimal conditions, the calibration curve demonstrates a linear relationship for 4-NP in the range from 20 nM to 8.0 μM and 8.0 μM to 0.1 mM separately with the detection limit of 8.0 nM. In addition to it, the performance of the GR/ABPE in practical applications was evaluated by detecting 4-NP in various water samples, and satisfactory recoveries were realized. Therefore, GR/ABPE may have a great potential application for facile and sensitive detection of 4-NP in complex matrices at nanomolar level.},

ABSTRACT = {Magnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles (NPs) and their surface modification with therapeutic substances are of great interest, especially drug delivery for cancer therapy, including boron-neutron capture therapy (BNCT). In this paper, we present the results of boron-rich compound (carborane borate) attachment to previously aminated by (3-aminopropyl)-trimethoxysilane (APTMS) iron oxide NPs. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy with Attenuated total reflectance accessory (ATR-FTIR) and energy-dispersive X-ray analysis confirmed the change of the element content of NPs after modification and formation of new bonds between Fe3O4 NPs and the attached molecules. Transmission (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed Fe3O4 NPs’ average size of 18.9 nm. Phase parameters were studied by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), and the magnetic behavior of Fe3O4 NPs was elucidated by Mössbauer spectroscopy. The colloidal and chemical stability of NPs was studied using simulated body fluid (phosphate buffer—PBS). Modified NPs have shown excellent stability in PBS (pH = 7.4), characterized by XRD, Mössbauer spectroscopy, and dynamic light scattering (DLS). Biocompatibility was evaluated in-vitro using cultured mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). The results show us an increasing of IC50 from 0.110 mg/mL for Fe3O4 NPs to 0.405 mg/mL for Fe3O4-Carborane NPs. The obtained data confirm the biocompatibility and stability of synthesized NPs and the potential to use them in BNCT.},

ABSTRACT = {The high demand for tissue engineering scaffolds capable of inducing bone regeneration using minimally invasive techniques prompts the need for the development of new biomaterials. Herein, we investigate the ability of Alginate incorporated with the fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl-diphenylalanine (FmocFF) peptide composite hydrogel to serve as a potential biomaterial for bone regeneration. We demonstrate that the incorporation of the self-assembling peptide, FmocFF, in sodium alginate leads to the production of a rigid, yet injectable, hydrogel without the addition of cross-linking agents. Scanning electron microscopy reveals a nanofibrous structure which mimics the natural bone extracellular matrix. The formed composite hydrogel exhibits thixotropic behavior and a high storage modulus of approximately 10 kPA, as observed in rheological measurements. The in vitro biocompatibility tests carried out with MC3T3-E1 preosteoblast cells demonstrate good cell viability and adhesion to the hydrogel fibers. This composite scaffold can induce osteogenic differentiation and facilitate calcium mineralization, as shown by Alizarin red staining, alkaline phosphatase activity and RT-PCR analysis. The high biocompatibility, excellent mechanical properties and similarity to the native extracellular matrix suggest the utilization of this hydrogel as a temporary three-dimensional cellular microenvironment promoting bone regeneration.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper reports the influence of dysprosium ion (Dy3+) substitution on the structural and magnetic properties of NiDyxFe2−xO4 (0.0 ≤ x ≤ 0.1) nanoparticles (NPs) prepared using a hydrothermal method. The structure and morphology of the as-synthesized NPs were characterized via X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning and transmission electron microscope (SEM, and TEM) analyses. 57Fe Mössbauer spectra were recorded to determine the Dy3+ content dependent variation in the line width, isomer shift, quadrupole splitting, and hyperfine magnetic fields. Furthermore, the magnetic properties of the prepared NPs were also investigated by zero-field cooled (ZFC) and field cooled (FC) magnetizations and AC susceptibility measurements. The MZFC (T) results showed a blocking temperature (TB). Below TB, the products behave as ferromagnetic (FM) and act superparamagnetic (SPM) above TB. The MFC (T) curves indicated the existence of super-spin glass (SSG) behavior below Ts (spin-glass freezing temperature). The AC susceptibility measurements confirmed the existence of the two transition temperatures (i.e., TB and Ts). Numerous models, e.g., Neel–Arrhenius (N–A), Vogel–Fulcher (V–F), and critical slowing down (CSD), were used to investigate the dynamics of the systems. It was found that the Dy substitution enhanced the magnetic interactions.},

ABSTRACT = {Molybdenum disulfide has been one of the most studied hydrogen evolution catalyst materials in recent years, but its disadvantages, such as poor conductivity, hinder its further development. Here, we employ the common hydrothermal method, followed by an additional solvothermal method to construct an uncommon molybdenum disulfide with two crystal forms of 1T and 2H to improve catalytic properties. The low overpotential (180 mV) and small Tafel slope (88 mV/dec) all indicated that molybdenum disulfide had favorable catalytic performance for hydrogen evolution. Further conjunctions revealed that the improvement of performance was probably related to the structural changes brought about by the 1T phase and the resulting sulfur vacancies, which could be used as a reference for the further application of MoS2.},

ABSTRACT = {Intrinsic self-healing and highly stretchable electro-conductive hydrogels demonstrate wide-ranging utilization in intelligent electronic skin. Herein, we propose a new class of strain sensors prepared by cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) and graphene (GN) co-incorporated poly (vinyl alcohol)-borax (GN-CNF@PVA) hydrogel. The borax can reversibly and dynamically associate with poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA) and GN-CNF nanocomplexes as a cross-linking agent, providing a tough and flexible network with the hydrogels. CNFs act as a bio-template and dispersant to support GN to create homogeneous GN-CNF aqueous dispersion, endowing the GN-CNF@PVA gels with promoted mechanical flexibility, strength and good conductivity. The resulting composite gels have high stretchability (break-up elongation up to 1000%), excellent viscoelasticity (storage modulus up to 3.7 kPa), rapid self-healing ability (20 s) and high healing efficiency (97.7 ± 1.2%). Due to effective electric pathways provided by GN-CNF nanocomplexes, the strain sensors integrated by GN-CNF@PVA hydrogel with good responsiveness, stability and repeatability can efficiently identify and monitor the various human motions with the gauge factor (GF) of about 3.8, showing promising applications in the field of wearable sensing devices.},

ABSTRACT = {A high recombination rate and low charge collection are the main limiting factors of copper oxides (cupric and cuprous oxide) for the photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants. In this paper, a high performance copper oxide photocatalyst was developed by integrating cupric oxide (CuO) and cuprous oxide (Cu2O) thin films, which showed superior performance for the photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue (MB) compared to the control CuO and Cu2O photocatalyst. Our results show that a heterojunction photocatalyst of CuO–Cu2O thin films could significantly increase the charge collection, reduce the recombination rate, and improve the photocatalytic activity.},

ABSTRACT = {The purpose of this work is the structural analysis of graphene oxide (GO) and by means of a new structural model to answer the questions arising from the Lerf–Klinowski and the Lee structural models. Surface functional groups of GO layers and the oxidative debris (OD) stacked on them were investigated after OD was extracted. Analysis was performed successfully using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis), X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), Raman spectroscopy, solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (SSNMR), standardized Boehm potentiometric titration analysis, elemental analysis, X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The analysis showed that graphene oxide layers, as well as oxidative debris contain different functional groups such as phenolic –OH, ketone, lactone, carboxyl, quinone and epoxy. Based on these results, a new structural model for GO layers is proposed, which covers all spectroscopic data and explains the presence of the other oxygen functionalities besides carboxyl, phenolic –OH and epoxy groups.},

ABSTRACT = {Several studies have provided information on environmental nanoplastic particles/debris, but the in vitro cyto-genotoxicity is still insufficiently characterized. The aim of this study is to analyze the effects of polystyrene nanoparticles (PNPs) in the Hs27 cell line. The viability of Hs27 cells was determined following exposure at different time windows and PNP concentrations. The genotoxic effects of the PNPs were evaluated by the cytokinesis-block micronucleus (CBMN) assay after exposure to PNPs. We performed ROS analysis on HS27 cells to detect reactive oxygen species at different times and treatments in the presence of PNPs alone and PNPs added to the Crocus sativus L. extract. The different parameters of the CBMN test showed DNA damage, resulting in the increased formation of micronuclei and nuclear buds. We noted a greater increase in ROS production in the short treatment times, in contrast, PNPs added to Crocus sativus extract showed the ability to reduce ROS production. Finally, the SEM-EDX analysis showed a three-dimensional structure of the PNPs with an elemental composition given by C and O. This work defines PNP toxicity resulting in DNA damage and underlines the emerging problem of polystyrene nanoparticles, which extends transversely from the environment to humans; further studies are needed to clarify the internalization process.},

ABSTRACT = {The paper describes preparation features of functional composites based on ferrites, such as “Ba(Fe1−xGax)12O19/epoxy,” and the results of studying their systems; namely, the correlation between structure, magnetic properties and electromagnetic absorption characteristics. We demonstrated the strong mutual influence of the chemical compositions of magnetic fillers (Ba(Fe1−xGax)12O19 0.01 < x < 0.1 solid solutions), and the main magnetic (coercivity, magnetization, anisotropy field and the first anisotropy constant) and microwave (resonant frequency and amplitude) characteristics of functional composites with 30 wt.% of hexaferrite. The paper presents a correlation between the chemical compositions of composites and amplitude–frequency characteristics. Increase of Ga-content from x = 0 to 0.1 in Ba(Fe1−xGax)12O19/epoxy composites leads to increase of the resonant frequency from 51 to 54 GHz and absorption amplitude from −1.5 to −10.5 dB/mm. The ability to control the electromagnetic properties in these types of composites opens great prospects for their practical applications due to high absorption efficiency, and lower cost in comparison with pure ceramics oxides.},

ABSTRACT = {Heat energy storage systems were fabricated with the impregnation method using MgO and Mg(OH)2 as supporting materials and polyethylene glycol (PEG-6000) as the functional phase. MgO and Mg(OH)2 were synthesized from the salt Mg(NO3)·6H2O by performing hydrothermal reactions with various precipitating agents. The precipitating agents were NaOH, KOH, NH3, NH3 with pamoic acid (PA), or (NH4)2CO3. The result shows that the selection of the precipitating agent has a significant impact on the crystallite structure, size, and shape of the final products. Of the precipitating agents tested, only NaOH and NH3 with PA produce single-phase Mg(OH)2 as the as-synthesized product. Pore size distribution analyses revealed that the surfaces of the as-synthesized MgO have a slit-like pore structure with a broad-type pore size distribution, whereas the as-synthesized Mg(OH)2 has a mesoporous structure with a narrow pore size distribution. This structure enhances the latent heat of the phase change material (PCM) as well as super cooling mitigation. The PEG/Mg(OH)2 PCM also exhibits reproducible behavior over a large number of thermal cycles. Both MgO and Mg(OH)2 matrices prevent the leakage of liquid PEG during the phase transition in phase change materials (PCMs). However, MgO/PEG has a low impregnation ratio and efficiency, with a low thermal storage capability. This is due to the large pore diameter, which does not allow MgO to retain a larger amount of PEG. The latent heat values of PEG-1000/PEG-6000 blends with MgO and Mg(OH)2 were also determined with a view to extending the application of the PCMs to energy storage over wider temperature ranges.},

ABSTRACT = {By means of critical coupling and impedance matching theory, we have numerically simulated the perfect absorption of monolayer graphene. Through the critical coupling effect and impedance matching, we studied a perfect single-band absorption of the monolayer graphene and obtained high quality factor (Q-factor = 664.2) absorption spectrum which has an absorbance close to 100% in the near infrared region. The position of the absorption spectrum can be adjusted by changing the ratio between the radii of the elliptic cylinder air hole and the structural period. The sensitivity of the absorber can be achieved S = 342.7 nm/RIU (RIU is the per refractive index unit) and FOM = 199.2 (FOM is the figure of merit), which has great potential for development on biosensors. We believe that our research will have good application prospects in graphene photonic devices and optoelectronic devices.},

ABSTRACT = {New magnetic iron oxide (Fe3O4)/activated charcoal (AC)/β-cyclodextrin (CD)/sodium alginate (Alg) polymer nanocomposite materials were prepared by direct mixing of the polymer matrix with the nanofillers. The obtained materials were utilized as nano-adsorbents for the elimination of methylene blue (MB), a hazardous water-soluble cationic dye, from aqueous solutions, and showed excellent regeneration capacity. The formation of the nanocomposites was followed by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) equipped with energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDX), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and adsorption of N2 at −196 °C. The rate of adsorption was investigated varying several factors, namely contact time, pH, amount of adsorbent and MB concentration on the adsorption process. Studies dealing with equilibrium and kinetics were carried out in batch conditions. The obtained results indicated that the removal rate of MB was 99.53% in 90 min. Langmuir’s isotherm fitted better to the equilibrium data of MB. Fe3O4/AC/CD/Alg polymer beads shows amazing adsorption capacities in the elimination of cationic dyes (2.079 mg/g for polymer gel beads and 10.63 mg g−1 for dry powder beads), in comparison to other adsorbent materials. The obtained adsorbent is spherical with hydrophobic cross-linked surface properties that enable an easy recovery without any significant weight loss of in the adsorbent used.},

ABSTRACT = {The present article reports an environmentally benign method for synthesizing silver nanoparticles using the fruit extract of Viburnum opulus L. as a source of bioactive compounds, which can act as reducing agents of the silver ions and also as stabilizing agents of the obtained nanoparticles. The catalytic ability of the synthesized silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) to remove toxic organic dyes was also evaluated. The biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles was firstly confirmed by UV-Vis spectral analysis, which revealed the presence of the characteristic absorption peak at 415 nm corresponding to the surface plasmon vibration of colloidal silver. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) studies were conducted to confirm the presence of bioactive phytocompounds, especially phenolics, as capping and stabilizing agents of the AgNPs. The size, morphology and crystalline nature of the synthesized AgNPs were investigated by transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction techniques revealing that the obtained nanoparticles were spherical shaped, with an average diameter of 16 nm, monodispersed, face centered cubic nanoparticles. Further, the catalytic ability in the degradation of tartrazine, carmoisine and brilliant blue FCF dyes by NaBH4 was evaluated. The results demonstrated an efficient activity against all the investigated dyes being an outstanding catalyst for the degradation of brilliant blue FCF. This eco-friendly synthetic approach can generate new tools useful in environmental pollution control.},

ABSTRACT = {In this article, we present a design for a triple-band tunable metamaterial absorber with an Au nano-cuboids array, and undertake numerical research about its optical properties and local electromagnetic field enhancement. The proposed structure is investigated by the finite-difference time domain (FDTD) method, and we find that it has triple-band tunable perfect absorption peaks in the near infrared band (1000–2500 nm). We investigate some of structure parameters that influence the fields of surface plasmons (SP) resonances of the nano array structure. By adjusting the relevant structural parameters, we can accomplish the regulation of the surface plasmons resonance (SPR) peaks. In addition, the triple-band resonant wavelength of the absorber has good operational angle-polarization-tolerance. We believe that the excellent properties of our designed absorber have promising applications in plasma-enhanced photovoltaic, optical absorption switching and infrared modulator optical communication.},

ABSTRACT = {Nanoparticles are expected to play a vital role in the management of future plant diseases, and they are expected to provide an environmentally friendly alternative to traditional synthetic fungicides. In the present study, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were green synthesized through the mediation by using the endophytic bacterium Pseudomonas poae strain CO, which was isolated from garlic plants (Allium sativum). Following a confirmation analysis that used UV–Vis, we examined the in vitro antifungal activity of the biosynthesized AgNPs with the size of 19.8–44.9 nm, which showed strong inhibition in the mycelium growth, spore germination, the length of the germ tubes, and the mycotoxin production of the wheat Fusarium head blight pathogen Fusarium graminearum. Furthermore, the microscopic examination showed that the morphological of mycelia had deformities and collapsed when treated with AgNPs, causing DNA and proteins to leak outside cells. The biosynthesized AgNPs with strong antifungal activity were further characterized based on analyses of X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, EDS profiles, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Overall, the results from this study clearly indicate that the biosynthesized AgNPs may have a great potential in protecting wheat from fungal infection.},

ABSTRACT = {In order to significantly enhance the absorption capability of solar energy absorbers in the visible wavelength region, a novel monolayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS2)-based nanostructure was proposed. Local surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs) supported by Au nanocubes (NCs) can improve the absorption of monolayer MoS2. A theoretical simulation by a finite-difference time-domain method (FDTD) shows that the absorptions of proposed MoS2-based absorbers are above 94.0% and 99.7% at the resonant wavelengths of 422 and 545 nm, respectively. In addition, the optical properties of the proposed nanostructure can be tuned by the geometric parameters of the periodic Au nanocubes array, distributed Bragg mirror (DBR) and polarization angle of the incident light, which are of great pragmatic significance for improving the absorption efficiency and selectivity of monolayer MoS2. The absorber is also able to withstand a wide range of incident angles, showing polarization-independence. Similar design ideas can also be implemented to other transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) to strengthen the interaction between light and MoS2. This nanostructure is relatively simple to implement and has a potentially important application value in the development of high-efficiency solar energy absorbers and other optoelectronic devices.},

ABSTRACT = {Biosynthesis of copper oxide nanoparticles (CuONPs) in a cost-effective and eco-friendly way has gained its importance. CuONPs has been prepared from copper sulfate by using Adiantum lunulatum whole plant extract. CuONPs have been characterized by X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic, transmission electron microscope, etc. Mono-disperse, spherical, pure, and highly stable CuONPs have formed with an average diameter of 6.5 ± 1.5 nm. Biosynthesized CuONPs at different concentrations were applied to seeds of Lens culinaris. Physiological characteristics were investigated in the germinated seeds. Roots obtained from the seeds treated with 0.025 mgmL−1 concentration of CuONPs showed highest activity of different defence enzymes and total phenolics. However, at higher concentration it becomes close to control. It showed gradual increase of antioxidative enzymes, in accordance with the increasing dose of CuONPs. Likewise, lipid peroxidation and proline content gradually increased with the increasing concentration. Reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide generation was also altered due to CuONPs treatment indicating stress signal transduction. Finally, this study provides a new approach of the production of valuable CuONPs, is a unique, economical, and handy tool for large scale saleable production which can also be used as a potent plant defence booster instead of other commercial uses.},

ABSTRACT = {In this study, date-palm biochar MgAl-augmented double-layered hydroxide (biochar–MgAl–LDH) nanocomposite was synthesized, characterized, and used for enhancing the removal of phosphate and nitrate pollutants from wastewater. The biochar–MgAl–LDH had higher selectivity and adsorption affinity towards phosphate compared to nitrate. The adsorption kinetics of both anions were better explained by the pseudo-first-order model with a faster removal rate to attain equilibrium in a shorter time, especially at lower initial phosphate-nitrate concentration. The maximum monolayer adsorption capacities of phosphate and nitrate by the non-linear Langmuir model were 177.97 mg/g and 28.06 mg/g, respectively. The coexistence of anions (Cl−, SO42−, NO3−, CO32− and HCO3−) negligibly affected the removal of phosphate due to its stronger bond on the nano-composites, while the presence of Cl− and PO43− reduced the nitrate removal attributed to the ions’ participation in the active adsorption sites on the surface of biochar–MgAl–LDH. The excellent adsorptive performance is the main synergetic influence of the MgAl–LDH incorporation into the biochar. The regeneration tests confirmed that the biochar–MgAl composite can be restored effortlessly and has the prospective to be reused after several subsequent adsorption-desorption cycles. The biochar-LDH further demonstrated capabilities for higher removal of phosphate and nitrate from real wastewater.},

ABSTRACT = {Drug resistance of pathogenic microorganisms has become a global public health problem, which has prompted the development of new materials with antimicrobial properties. In this context, antimicrobial nanohybrids are an alternative due to their synergistic properties. In this study, we used an environmentally friendly one-step approach to synthesize graphene oxide (GO) decorated with silver nanoparticles (GO–AgNPs). By this process, spherical AgNPs of average size less than 4 nm homogeneously distributed on the surface of the partially reduced GO can be generated in the absence of any stabilizing agent, only with ascorbic acid (L-AA) as a reducing agent and AgNO3 as a metal precursor. The size of the AgNPs can be controlled by the AgNO3 concentration and temperature. Smaller AgNPs are obtained at lower concentrations of the silver precursor and lower temperatures. The antimicrobial properties of nanohybrids against Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus, and the yeast Candida albicans were found to be concentration- and time-dependent. C. albicans and S. aureus showed the highest susceptibility to GO–AgNPs. These nanohybrids can be used as nanofillers in polymer nanocomposites to develop materials with antimicrobial activity for applications in different areas, and another potential application could be cancer therapeutic agents.},

ABSTRACT = {Polymer hydrogels have been suggested as dressing materials for the treatment of cutaneous wounds and tissue revitalization. In this work, we report the development of a hydrogel composed of natural polymers (sodium alginate and gelatin) and silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) with recognized antimicrobial activity for healing cutaneous lesions. For the development of the hydrogel, different ratios of sodium alginate and gelatin have been tested, while different concentrations of AgNO3 precursor (1.0, 2.0, and 4.0 mM) were assayed for the production of AgNPs. The obtained AgNPs exhibited a characteristic peak between 430–450 nm in the ultraviolet-visible (UV–Vis) spectrum suggesting a spheroidal form, which was confirmed by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). Fourier Transform Infra-red (FT–IR) analysis suggested the formation of strong intermolecular interactions as hydrogen bonds and electrostatic attractions between polymers, showing bands at 2920, 2852, 1500, and 1640 cm−1. Significant bactericidal activity was observed for the hydrogel, with a Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of 0.50 µg/mL against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 53.0 µg/mL against Staphylococcus aureus. AgNPs were shown to be non-cytotoxic against fibroblast cells. The in vivo studies in female Wister rats confirmed the capacity of the AgNP-loaded hydrogels to reduce the wound size compared to uncoated injuries promoting histological changes in the healing tissue over the time course of wound healing, as in earlier development and maturation of granulation tissue. The developed hydrogel with AgNPs has healing potential for clinical applications.},

ABSTRACT = {Non-modified (ZnO) and modified (Fe2O3@ZnO and CuO@ZnO) structured films are deposited via aerosol assisted chemical vapor deposition. The surface modification of ZnO with iron or copper oxides is achieved in a second aerosol assisted chemical vapor deposition step and the characterization of morphology, structure, and surface of these new structured films is discussed. X-ray photoelectron spectrometry and X-ray diffraction corroborate the formation of ZnO, Fe2O3, and CuO and the electron microscopy images show the morphological and crystalline characteristics of these structured films. Static water contact angle measurements for these structured films indicate hydrophobic behavior with the modified structures showing higher contact angles compared to the non-modified films. Overall, results show that the modification of ZnO with iron or copper oxides enhances the hydrophobic behavior of the surface, increasing the contact angle of the water drops at the non-modified ZnO structures from 122° to 135° and 145° for Fe2O3@ZnO and CuO@ZnO, respectively. This is attributed to the different surface properties of the films including the morphology and chemical composition.},

ABSTRACT = {A pure ferrite and epoxy samples as well as the epoxy/ferrite composites with different 20 wt.%, 30 wt.%, 40 wt.%, and 50 wt.% weight ferrite contents have been prepared by the chemical co-precipitation method. AC-conductivity and dielectric properties such as the dielectric constant and dielectric loss of the prepared samples have been studied. The obtained results showed that the samples had a semiconductor behavior. The dielectric constant of the composites has been calculated theoretically using several models. For the composite sample that contains 20 wt.% of ferrites, these models give satisfactory compliance, while for the composite samples with a higher percentage of nanofillers, more than 30 wt.% theoretical results do not coincide with experimental data. The investigated polymer has very low conductivity, so this type of polymer can be useful for high-frequency applications, which can reduce the losses caused by eddy current. Thus, the prepared samples are promising materials for practical use as elements of microwave devices.},

ABSTRACT = {Ratiometric luminescence thermometry employing luminescence within the biological transparency windows provides high potential for biothermal imaging. Nd3+ is a promising candidate for that purpose due to its intense radiative transitions within biological windows (BWs) I and II and the simultaneous efficient excitability within BW I. This makes Nd3+ almost unique among all lanthanides. Typically, emission from the two 4F3/2 crystal field levels is used for thermometry but the small ~100 cm−1 energy separation limits the sensitivity. A higher sensitivity for physiological temperatures is possible using the luminescence intensity ratio (LIR) of the emissive transitions from the 4F5/2 and 4F3/2 excited spin-orbit levels. Herein, we demonstrate and discuss various pitfalls that can occur in Boltzmann thermometry if this particular LIR is used for physiological temperature sensing. Both microcrystalline, dilute (0.1%) Nd3+-doped LaPO4 and LaPO4: x% Nd3+ (x = 2, 5, 10, 25, 100) nanocrystals serve as an illustrative example. Besides structural and optical characterization of those luminescent thermometers, the impact and consequences of the Nd3+ concentration on their luminescence and performance as Boltzmann-based thermometers are analyzed. For low Nd3+ concentrations, Boltzmann equilibrium starts just around 300 K. At higher Nd3+ concentrations, cross-relaxation processes enhance the decay rates of the 4F3/2 and 4F5/2 levels making the decay faster than the equilibration rates between the levels. It is shown that the onset of the useful temperature sensing range shifts to higher temperatures, even above ~ 450 K for Nd concentrations over 5%. A microscopic explanation for pitfalls in Boltzmann thermometry with Nd3+ is finally given and guidelines for the usability of this lanthanide ion in the field of physiological temperature sensing are elaborated. Insight in competition between thermal coupling through non-radiative transitions and population decay through cross-relaxation of the 4F5/2 and 4F3/2 spin-orbit levels of Nd3+ makes it possible to tailor the thermometric performance of Nd3+ to enable physiological temperature sensing.},

ABSTRACT = {Particle size of nanomaterials has significant impact on their photocatalyst properties. In this paper, TiO2 nanoparticles with different crystalline sizes were prepared by adjusting the alkali-hydrothermal time (0–48 h). An annealing in N2 atmosphere after hydrothermal treatment caused TiO2 reduction and created defects, resulting in the visible light photocatalytic activity. The evolution of physicochemical properties along with the increase of hydrothermal time at a low alkali concentration has been revealed. Compared with other TiO2 samples, TiO2-24 showed higher photocatalytic activity toward degrading Rhodamine B and Sulfadiazine under visible light. The radical trapping and ESR experiments revealed that O2•- is the main reactive specie in TiO2-24. Large specific surface areas and rapid transfer of photogenerated electrons are responsible for enhancing photocatalytic activity. The above findings clearly demonstrate that particle size and surface oxygen defects can be regulated by alkali-hydrothermal method. This research will deepen the understanding of particle size on the nanomaterials performance and provide new ideas for designing efficient photocatalysts.},

ABSTRACT = {In spite of great developments in the agricultural field and plant productivity in the last decades, the concern about the control of agricultural pests is still continuous. However, pest management is expected to have more effects from nanomaterials by providing innovative solutions. The current study confirms the biotransformation of copper nanoparticles (CuNPs) using a cell-free culture extract of metal copper-resistant bacteria Pseudomonas fluorescens MAL2, which was isolated from heavy metal-contaminated soils collected from Sharqia Governorate, Egypt. The local screened bacterial isolate, Pseudomonas fluorescens MAL2, is similar to Pseudomonas fluorescens DSM 12442T DSM. After optimization of growth conditions, F-Base medium was found to be the best medium and pH 7, temperature 35 °C, concentration of CuSO4·5H2O 300 ppm, 10 mL supernatant: 40 mL CuSO4·5H2O (300 ppm), and reaction time 90 min were recorded as the best growth conditions to the fabrication of CuNPs. The formed CuNPs were characterized using initially visual observation of the change in the color of the reaction mixture from blue color to the dark green as an indication of CuNPs biotransformation. Then, UV–Vis spectroscopy showed a maximum absorption at 610 nm under the optimum conditions performed. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) revealed the formation of spherical aspect with size ranges from 10:70 nm; moreover, Energy Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) indicated the presence of CuNPs and other elements. In addition, the presence of alcohols, phenols, alkenes, and amines is confirmed by Fourier-Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectroscopy analysis. Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) supported that the Zeta-average size of nanoparticle was 48.07 with 0.227 PdI value. The Zeta potential showed −26.00mV with a single peak. The biosynthesized CuNPs (Bio CuNPs) showed toxicity against the stored grain pest (Tribolium castaneum), where LC50 value was 37 ppm after 5 days of treatment. However, the negligible effect was observed with chemical synthesis of CuNPs (Ch CuNPs) at the same concentration. The results suggest that Bio CuNPs could be used not only as a biocontrol agent, but also as an ecofriendly and inexpensive approach for controlling the stored grain pests.},

ABSTRACT = {The NOx degradation performance of nano-TiO2 as a coating material for the road environment was evaluated in this research. The nano-TiO2 coating materials for both road surface and roadside were prepared by using anatase nano-TiO2, activated carbon powder, silane coupling agent and deionized water. The impact of varying amounts of coating material and silane coupling agent were evaluated. The road environment of NOx degradation was simulated by the photocatalytic test system designed by the research team. For the road surface coating, the photocatalytic degradation experiments of NO under different radiation intensities were carried out. The results show that the material has good photocatalytic degradation performance, and the proper amount of silane coupling agent can enhance the bonding performance of the material and asphalt mixture. For the roadside coating, sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate was selected as the surfactant to carry out the photocatalytic degradation experiment of NO2 with different dosages of surfactant. The results showed that when the mass ratio of nano-TiO2 and surfactant was about 1:2, the catalytic degradation effect of the material was the best.},

ABSTRACT = {Nanofluids in minichannels with various configurations are applied as cooling and heating fluids. Therefore, it is essential to have an optimal design of minichannels. For this purpose, a square channel with a cylinder in the center connected to wavy fins at various concentrations of an Al2O3 nanofluid is simulated using the finite volume method (FVM). Moreover, central composite design (CCD) is used as a method of design of experiment (DOE) to study the effects of three input variables, namely the cylinder diameter, channel width, and fin radius on the convective heat transfer and pumping power. The impacts of the linear term, together with those of the square and interactive on the response variables are determined using Pareto and main effects plots by an ANOVA. The non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II), along with the response surface methodology (RSM) is applied to achieve the optimal configuration and nanofluid concentration. The results indicate that the effect of the channel width and cylinder diameter enhances about 21% and 18% by increasing the concentration from 0% to 5%. On the other hand, the pumping power response is not sensitive to the nanofluid concentration. Besides, the channel width has the highest and lowest effect on the heat transfer coefficient (HTC) and pumping power, respectively. The optimization for a concentration of 3% indicates that in Re = 500 when the geometry is optimized, the HTC enhances by almost 9%, while the pumping power increases by about 18%. In contrast, by increasing the concentration from 1% to 3%, merely an 8% enhancement in HTC is obtained, while the pumping power intensifies around 60%.},

ABSTRACT = {In the present work, a facile one-step hydrothermal synthesis of well-defined stabilized CuO nanopetals and its surface study by advanced nanocharacterization techniques for enhanced optical and catalytic properties has been investigated. Characterization by Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis confirmed existence of high crystalline CuO nanopetals with average length and diameter of 1611.96 nm and 650.50 nm, respectively. The nanopetals are monodispersed with a large surface area, controlled morphology, and demonstrate the nanocrystalline nature with a monoclinic structure. The phase purity of the as-synthesized sample was confirmed by Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns. A significantly wide absorption up to 800 nm and increased band gap were observed in CuO nanopetals. The valance band (VB) and conduction band (CB) positions at CuO surface are measured to be of +0.7 and −1.03 eV, respectively, using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), which would be very promising for efficient catalytic properties. Furthermore, the obtained CuO nanopetals in the presence of hydrogen peroxide ( H 2 O 2 ) achieved excellent catalytic activities for degradation of methylene blue (MB) under dark, with degradation rate > 99% after 90 min, which is significantly higher than reported in the literature. The enhanced catalytic activity was referred to the controlled morphology of monodispersed CuO nanopetals, co-operative role of H 2 O 2 and energy band structure. This work contributes to a new approach for extensive application opportunities in environmental improvement.},

ABSTRACT = {The investigation of innovative electrolytes based on nontoxic and nonflammable solvents is an up-to-date, intriguing challenge to push forward the environmental sustainability of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Water is one of the best choices, thus 100% aqueous electrolytes are proposed in this work, which are gelled with xanthan gum. This well-known biosourced polymer matrix is able to form stable and easily processable hydrogel electrolytes based on the iodide/triiodide redox couple. An experimental strategy, also supported by the multivariate chemometric approach, is used here to study the main factors influencing DSSCs efficiency and stability, leading to an optimized system able to improve its efficiency by 20% even after a 1200 h aging test, and reaching an overall performance superior to 2.7%. In-depth photoelectrochemical investigation demonstrates that DSSCs performance based on hydrogel electrolytes depends on many factors (e.g., dipping conditions, redox mediator concentrations, etc.), that must be carefully quantified and correlated in order to optimize these hydrogels. Photovoltaic performances are also extremely reproducible and stable in an open cell filled in air atmosphere, noticeably without any vacuum treatments.},

ABSTRACT = {We report on a comparison of methods based on XRD patterns for calculating crystal size. In this case, XRD peaks were extracted from hydroxyapatite obtained from cow, pig, and chicken bones. Hydroxyapatite was synthesized through the thermal treatment of natural bones at 950 °C. XRD patterns were selected by adjustment of X-Pert software for each method and for calculating the size of the crystals. Methods consisted of Scherrer (three models), Monshi–Scherrer, three models of Williamson–Hall (namely the Uniform Deformation Model (UDM), the Uniform Stress Deformation Model (USDM), and the Uniform Deformation Energy Density Model (UDEDM)), Halder–Wanger (H-W), and the Size Strain Plot Method (SSP). These methods have been used and compared together. The sizes of crystallites obtained by the XRD patterns in each method for hydroxyapatite from cow, pig, and chicken were 1371, 457, and 196 nm in the Scherrer method when considering all of the available peaks together (straight line model). A new model (straight line passing the origin) gave 60, 60, and 53 nm, which shows much improvement. The average model gave 56, 58, and 52 nm, for each of the three approaches, respectively, for cow, pig, and chicken. The Monshi–Scherrer method gave 60, 60, and 57 nm. Values of 56, 62, and 65 nm were given by the UDM method. The values calculated by the USDM method were 60, 62, and 62 nm. The values of 62, 62, and 65 nm were given by the UDEDM method for cow, pig, and chicken, respectively. Furthermore, the crystal size value was 4 nm for all samples in the H-W method. Values were also calculated as 43, 62, and 57 nm in the SSP method for cow, pig, and chicken tandemly. According to the comparison of values in each method, the Scherrer method (straight line model) for considering all peaks led to unreasonable values. Nevertheless, other values were in the acceptable range, similar to the reported values in the literature. Experimental analyses, such as specific surface area by gas adsorption (Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET)) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), were utilized. In the final comparison, parameters of accuracy, ease of calculations, having a check point for the researcher, and difference between the obtained values and experimental analysis by BET and TEM were considered. The Monshi–Scherrer method provided ease of calculation and a decrease in errors by applying least squares to the linear plot. There is a check point for this line that the slope must not be far from one. Then, the intercept gives the most accurate crystal size. In this study, the setup of values for BET (56, 52, and 49 nm) was also similar to the Monshi–Scherrer method and the use of it in research studies of nanotechnology is advised.},

ABSTRACT = {An endophytic strain of Streptomyces antimycoticus L-1 was isolated from healthy medicinal plant leaves of Mentha longifolia L. and used for the green synthesis of silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs), through the use of secreted enzymes and proteins. UV–vis spectroscopy, Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and dynamic light scattering (DLS) analyses of the Ag-NPs were carried out. The XRD, TEM, and FT-IR analysis results demonstrated the successful biosynthesis of crystalline, spherical Ag-NPs with a particle size of 13–40 nm. Further, the stability of the Ag-NPs was assessed by detecting the surface Plasmon resonance (SPR) at 415 nm for one month or by measuring the NPs surface charge (−19.2 mV) by zeta potential analysis (ζ). The green-synthesized Ag-NPs exhibited broad-spectrum antibacterial activity at different concentrations (6.25–100 ppm) against the pathogens Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Salmonella typhimurium with a clear inhibition zone ranging from (9.5 ± 0.4) nm to (21.7 ± 1.0) mm. Furthermore, the green-synthesized Ag-NPs displayed high efficacy against the Caco-2 cancerous cell line (the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) = 5.7 ± 0.2 ppm). With respect to antibacterial and in-vitro cytotoxicity analyses, the Ag-NPs concentration of 100 ppm was selected as a safe dose for loading onto cotton fabrics. The scanning electron microscopy connected with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX) for the nano-finished fabrics showed the distribution of Ag-NPs as 2% of the total fabric elements. Moreover, the nano-finished fabrics exhibited more activity against pathogenic Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, even after 10 washing cycles, indicating the stability of the treated fabrics.},

ABSTRACT = {In this study, zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO-NPs) were successfully fabricated through the harnessing of metabolites present in the cell filtrate of a newly isolated and identified microalga Arthrospira platensis (Class: Cyanophyceae). The formed ZnO-NPs were characterized by UV–Vis spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDX), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Data showed the efficacy of cyanobacterial metabolites in fabricating spherical, crystallographic ZnO-NPs with a size ≈30.0 to 55.0 nm at a wavelength of 370 nm. Moreover, FT-IR analysis showed varied absorption peaks related to nanoparticle formation. XPS analysis confirms the presence of Zn(II)O at different varied bending energies. Data analyses exhibit that the activities of biosynthesized ZnO-NPs were dose-dependent. Their application as an antimicrobial agent was examined and formed clear zones, 24.1 ± 0.3, 21.1 ± 0.06, 19.1 ± 0.3, 19.9 ± 0.1, and 21.6 ± 0.6 mm, at 200 ppm against Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Candida albicans, respectively, and these activities were reduced as the NPs concentration decreased. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values were determined as 50 ppm for S. aureus, 25 ppm for P. aeruginosa, and 12.5 ppm for B. subtilis, E. coli, and C. albicans. More interestingly, ZnO-NPs exhibit high in vitro cytotoxic efficacy against cancerous (Caco-2) (IC50 = 9.95 ppm) as compared with normal (WI38) cell line (IC50 = 53.34 ppm).},

ABSTRACT = {Annona muricata is one of the most important traditional medicinal plants which contains numerous chemicals that exhibit various pharmacological properties. In this study, silver nanoparticles were prepared using A. muricata peel extract as a reducing agent and the effect was enhanced through A. muricata like pharmaceutical activity. AgNPs formation was confirmed by color changes, UV-visible spectroscopy, SEM, DLS, and XRD. The anti-proliferative activity of AgNPs against THP-1, AMJ-13, and HBL cell lines was studied. Apoptotic markers were tested using AO/EtBr staining assay, cell cycle phases using flowcytometry, and the expression of P53. Autophagy takes an essential part in controlling inflammasome activation by primary bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs). We report novel functions for AgNPs-affected autophagy, represented by the control of the release of IL-1β, caspase-1, adaptor protein apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC), and NLRP3 in BMDMs following treatment with LPS+ATP. The current study revealed that the AgNPs inhibited THP-1 and AMJ-13 cell proliferation. Meanwhile, the AgNPs significantly increased autophagy and reduced IL-1b and NLRP3 levels in both in vivo and in vitro models. The secretion of IL-1β was reduced whereas the degradation of NLRP3 inflammasome was enhanced. These findings propose that AgNPs apply an anti-proliferative activity against THP-1 and AMJ-13 cells through the stimulation of apoptosis via mitochondrial damage and induction of p53 protein pathway. In addition, AgNP-induced autophagy reduced the levels of IL-1β and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. This indicated that the AgNPs augment autophagy controlled by the IL-1β pathway via two different novel mechanisms. The first one is regulating activation of the IL-1 β, caspase-1, and ASC, while the second is NLRP3 targeting for lysosomal degradation. Overall, this study suggests that AgNPs could be a potent therapy for various types of cancer and an alternative treatment for preventing inflammation via enhancing autophagy.},

ABSTRACT = {Salt stress severely reduces growth and yield of plants. Considering the positive effects of selenium (Se) and chitosan (Cs) separately against abiotic stress, in these experiments, we synthesized chitosan–selenium nanoparticles (Cs–Se NPs) and investigated their ability to reduce the negative effects of salt stress on growth and some biochemical parameters of bitter melon (Momordica charantia). Bitter melon plants were grown at three NaCl salinity levels (0, 50, and 100 mM) and a foliar spray of Cs–Se NPs (0, 10, and 20 mg L−1) was applied. Some key morphological, biochemical, and physiological parameters in leaf samples and essential oil from fruit were measured at harvest. Salinity decreased growth and yield while foliar application of Cs–Se NPs increased these critical parameters. Furthermore, Cs–Se NPs enhanced bitter melon tolerance to salinity by increasing antioxidant enzyme activity, proline concentration, relative water content, and K+, and decreasing MDA and H2O2 oxidants and Na aggregation in plant tissues. Yield was also improved, as the highest amount of essential oils was produced by plants treated with Cs–Se NPs. Generally, the greatest improvement in measured parameters under saline conditions was obtained by treating plants with 20 mg L−1 Cs–Se NPs, which significantly increased salinity tolerance in bitter melon plants.},

ABSTRACT = {A green synthetic route for the production of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) using five different aqueous plant extracts, namely, Berberis vulgaris, Brassica nigra, Capsella bursa-pastoris, Lavandula angustifolia and Origanum vulgare, was investigated in this study. The present work demonstrates the influence of plant extract composition (antioxidant and total phenolic content) on the size and morphology of the produced AgNPs. The biosynthetic procedure was rapid and simple and was easily monitored via colour changes and ultraviolet and visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy. Subsequently, measurement of zeta potential (ZP), photon cross-correlation spectroscopy (PCCS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) analysis were employed to characterise the as-synthesised nanoparticles. The XRD investigation confirmed the presence of Ag0 in the nanoparticles, and interactions between the bioactive compounds of the plants and the produced AgNPs were evident in the FTIR spectra. TEM indicated that the nanoparticles exhibited a bimodal size distribution, with the smaller particles being spherical and the larger having a truncated octahedron shape. In addition, the antimicrobial activity of the AgNPs was tested against five bacterial strains. All synthesised nanoparticles exhibited enhanced antimicrobial activity at a precursor concentration of 5 mM compared to the control substance, gentamicin sulphate, with the best results observed for AgNPs prepared with B. nigra and L. angustifolia extracts.},

ABSTRACT = {Recent achievements, based on lead (Pb) halide perovskites, have prompted comprehensive research on low-cost photovoltaics, in order to avoid the major challenges that arise in this respect: Stability and toxicity. In this study, device modelling of lead (Pb)-free perovskite solar cells has been carried out considering methyl ammonium tin bromide (CH3NH3SnBr3) as perovskite absorber layer. The perovskite structure has been justified theoretically by Goldschmidt tolerance factor and the octahedral factor. Numerical modelling tools were used to investigate the effects of amphoteric defect and interface defect states on the photovoltaic parameters of CH3NH3SnBr3-based perovskite solar cell. The study identifies the density of defect tolerance in the absorber layer, and that both the interfaces are 1015 cm−3, and 1014 cm−3, respectively. Furthermore, the simulation evaluates the influences of metal work function, uniform donor density in the electron transport layer and the impact of series resistance on the photovoltaic parameters of proposed n-TiO2/i-CH3NH3SnBr3/p-NiO solar cell. Considering all the optimization parameters, CH3NH3SnBr3-based perovskite solar cell exhibits the highest efficiency of 21.66% with the Voc of 0.80 V, Jsc of 31.88 mA/cm2 and Fill Factor of 84.89%. These results divulge the development of environmentally friendly methyl ammonium tin bromide perovskite solar cell.},

ABSTRACT = {SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for several million deaths to date globally, and both fomite transmission from surfaces as well as airborne transmission from aerosols may be largely responsible for the spread of the virus. Here, nanoparticle coatings of three antimicrobial materials (Ag, CuO and ZnO) are deposited on both solid flat surfaces as well as porous filter media, and their activity against SARS-CoV-2 viability is compared with a viral plaque assay. These nanocoatings are manufactured by aerosol nanoparticle self-assembly during their flame synthesis. Nanosilver particles as a coating exhibit the strongest antiviral activity of the three studied nanomaterials, while copper oxide exhibits moderate activity, and zinc oxide does not appear to significantly reduce the virus infectivity. Thus, nanosilver and copper oxide show potential as antiviral coatings on solid surfaces and on filter media to minimize transmission and super-spreading events while also providing critical information for the current and any future pandemic mitigation efforts.},

ABSTRACT = {The current work concentrated on the green synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) through the use of aqueous Citruslimon zest extract, optimizing the different experimental factors required for the formation and stability of AgNPs. The preparation of nanoparticles was confirmed by the observation of the color change of the mixture of silver nitrate, after the addition of the plant extract, from yellow to a reddish-brown colloidal suspension and was established by detecting the surface plasmon resonance band at 535.5 nm, utilizing UV-Visible analysis. The optimum conditions were found to be 1 mM of silver nitrate concentration, a 1:9 ratio extract of the mixture, and a 4 h incubation period. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy spectrum indicated that the phytochemicals compounds present in Citrus limon zest extract had a fundamental effect on the production of AgNPs as a bio-reducing agent. The morphology, size, and elemental composition of AgNPs were investigated by zeta potential (ZP), dynamic light scattering (DLS), SEM, EDX, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis, which showed crystalline spherical silver nanoparticles. In addition, the antimicrobial and antioxidant properties of this bioactive silver nanoparticle were also investigated. The AgNPs showed excellent antibacterial activity against one Gram-negative pathogens bacteria, Escherichia coli, and one Gram-positive bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus, as well as antifungal activity against Candida albicans. The obtained results indicate that the antioxidant activity of this nanoparticle is significant. This bioactive silver nanoparticle can be used in biomedical and pharmacological fields.},
