ABSTRACT = {The efficiency of devices for biomedical applications, including tissue engineering and neuronal stimulation, heavily depends on their biocompatibility and performance level. Therefore, it is important to find adequate materials that meet the necessary requirements such as (i) being intrinsically compatible with biological systems, (ii) providing a sufficient electronic conductivity that promotes efficient signal transduction, (iii) having “soft” mechanical properties comparable to biological structures, and (iv) being degradable in physiological solution. We have developed organic conducting biocompatible single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) composites based on bovine serum albumin, carboxymethylcellulose, and acrylic polymer and investigated their properties, which are relevant for biomedical applications. This includes ζ-potential measurements, conductivity analyses, and SEM micrographs, the latter providing a local analysis of SWCNT distribution in the base material. We observed the development of the electrical conductivity of the SWCNT composites exposed to 1 mM KCl electrolyte for 40 days, representing a high stability of the samples. The conductivity of samples reaches 1300 S/m for 0.45 wt.% nanotubes. Moreover, we demonstrated the biocompatibility of the composites via cultivating fibroblast cell culture. Finally, we showed that composite coating results in the longer lifespan of cells on the surface. Overall, the SWCNT-based conductive composites might be a promising material for extended biomedical applications.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, we present a study of tungsten disulfide (WS2) two-dimensional (2D) crystals, grown on epitaxial Graphene. In particular, we have employed scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and µRaman spectroscopy combined with multifunctional scanning probe microscopy (SPM), operating in peak force–quantitative nano mechanical (PF-QNM), ultrasonic force microscopy (UFM) and electrostatic force microscopy (EFM) modes. This comparative approach provides a wealth of useful complementary information and allows one to cross-analyze on the nanoscale the morphological, mechanical, and electrostatic properties of the 2D heterostructures analyzed. Herein, we show that PF-QNM can accurately map surface properties, such as morphology and adhesion, and that UFM is exceptionally sensitive to a broader range of elastic properties, helping to uncover subsurface features located at the buried interfaces. All these data can be correlated with the local electrostatic properties obtained via EFM mapping of the surface potential, through the cantilever response at the first harmonic, and the dielectric permittivity, through the cantilever response at the second harmonic. In conclusion, we show that combining multi-parametric SPM with SEM and µRaman spectroscopy helps to identify single features of the WS2/Graphene/SiC heterostructures analyzed, demonstrating that this is a powerful tool-set for the investigation of 2D materials stacks, a building block for new advanced nano-devices.},

ABSTRACT = {Anaerobic treatments have been described for the biodegradation of pollutants. However, the reactions proceed slowly due to the recalcitrant nature of these compounds. Carbon nanomaterials (CNM) intermediate in, and favor, the electron transfer, accelerating the anaerobic reduction of pollutants, which act as final electron acceptors. In the present work, different carbon nanotubes (CNT) with modified surface chemistry, namely CNT oxidized with HNO3 (CNT_HNO3) and CNT doped with nitrogen in a ball milling process (CNT_N_MB) were prepared using commercial CNT as a starting material. The new CNM were tested as redox mediators (RM), 0.1 g L−1, in the biological reduction of the azo dye, Acid Orange 10 (AO10), with an anaerobic granular sludge, over 48 h of reaction. Methane production was also assessed to verify the microorganism’s activity and the CNM’s effect on the methanogenic activity. An improvement in the biological removal of AO10 occurred with all CNM (above 90%), when compared with the control without CNM (only 32.4 ± 0.3%). The best results were obtained with CNT_N_MB, which achieved 98.2 ± 0.1% biological AO10 removal, and an 11-fold reduction rate increase. In order to confer magnetic properties to the CNM, tailored CNT were impregnated with 2% of iron-samples: CNT@2%Fe, CNT@2%Fe_N_MB, and CNT@2%Fe_HNO3. The better performance of the CNT doped with nitrogen was confirmed with CNT@2%Fe_N_MB, and the magnetic character facilitated its recovery after treatment, and did not affect its good catalytic properties. No dye removal was observed in the abiotic assays, so the removal was not due to adsorption on the CNM. Furthermore, the microorganism’s viability was maintained during the assay and methane production was not affected by the presence of the CNM. Despite the toxic character of the aromatic amines formed, detoxification was observed after the biological process with thermally treated CNT.},

ABSTRACT = {The cathode, a crucial constituent part of Li-ion batteries, determines the output voltage and integral energy density of batteries to a great extent. Among them, Ni-rich LiNixCoyMnzO2 (x + y + z = 1, x ≥ 0.6) layered transition metal oxides possess a higher capacity and lower cost as compared to LiCoO2, which have stimulated widespread interests. However, the wide application of Ni-rich cathodes is seriously hampered by their poor diffusion dynamics and severe voltage drops. To moderate these problems, a nanobrick Ni-rich layered LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 cathode with a preferred orientation (110) facet was designed and successfully synthesized via a modified co-precipitation route. The galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis of LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 reveal its superior kinetic performance endowing outstanding rate performance and long-term cycle stability, especially the voltage drop being as small as 67.7 mV at a current density of 0.5 C for 200 cycles. Due to its unique architecture, dramatically shortened ion/electron diffusion distance, and more unimpeded Li-ion transmission pathways, the current nanostructured LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 cathode enhances the Li-ion diffusion dynamics and suppresses the voltage drop, thus resulting in superior electrochemical performance.},

ABSTRACT = {Ultrafine ZrB2-ZrC composite powders were synthesized via a radiofrequency (RF) thermal plasma process. Numerical simulation and thermodynamic analysis were conducted to predict the synthesis process, and experimental work was performed accordingly to demonstrate its feasibility. The as-prepared samples were characterized by XRD, FESEM, particle size analyzer, nitrogen/oxygen analyzer, Hall flowmeter, and the Brunner-Emmet-Teller (BET) measurements. The thermodynamic analysis indicated that ZrB2 was preferentially generated, rather than ZrC, and numerical simulation revealed that the solid raw materials could disperse well in the gaseous reactants, and experimental work showed that free carbon particles were easily removed from the products and the elements of Zr, B, C, and O exhibited a uniform distribution. Finally, ZrB2-ZrC composite powders with a particle size of about 100 nm were obtained, the surface area of which was 32.15 m2/g and the apparent density was 0.57 g/cm3.},

ABSTRACT = {Encapsulating CdS quantum dots (QDs) into zeolitic imidazole framework-8 (ZIF-8) can offer several advantages for photocatalysis. Various types of capping agents have been used to encapsulate QDs into ZIF-8 nanopores. An effective method for encapsulating CdS QDs into ZIF-8 is to use 2-mercaptoimidazole as the capping agent. This is because 2-mercaptoimidazole is similar to the imidazolate ligands of ZIFs and can used for capping active species with simultaneous encapsulation during the crystal growth of ZIF-8. Compared to other widely used capping agents such as polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), using 2-mercaptoimidazole for encapsulating CdS QDs into ZIF-8 revealed photocatalytic effects along with the molecular sieving effect when using differently sized molecular redox mediators such as methyl viologen (MV2+) and diquat (DQ2+).},

ABSTRACT = {The main focus of this work was to establish a correlation between surface topography and chemistry and surface colonization by lactic acid bacteria. For this reason, we chose gold substrates with different surface architectures (i.e., smooth and nanorough) that were characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM), electron scanning microscopy (SEM), and X-ray diffractometry (XRD). Moreover, to enhance biocompatibility, we modified gold substrates with polymeric monolayers, namely cationic dextran derivatives with different molar masses. The presence of those layers was confirmed by AFM, infrared spectroscopy (IR), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). In order to determine the adhesion abilities of non-modified and modified gold surfaces, we tested three lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains (i.e., Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Lactobacillus plantarum 299v). We have shown that surface roughness influences the surface colonization of bacteria, and the most significant impact on the growth was observed for the Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG strain. What is more, covering the gold surface with a molecular polymeric film by using the layer-by-layer (LbL) method allows additional changes in the bacterial growth, independently on the used strain. The well-being of the bacteria cells on tested surfaces was confirmed by using selective staining and fluorescence microscopy. Finally, we have determined the bacterial metabolic activity by measuring the amount of produced lactic acid regarding the growth conditions. The obtained results proved that the adhesion of bacteria to the metallic surface depends on the chemistry and topography of the surface, as well as the specific bacteria strain.},

ABSTRACT = {We report on a versatile method for chemically grafting multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) onto the surface of conventional glass fibers (GFs), as well as depositing further silica (SiO2) or superparamagnetic (SPM) magnetite (Fe3O4) nanoparticles (NPs) creating novel hierarchical reinforcements. The CNT-grafted GFs (GF-CNT) were utilized further as the support to decorate nano-sized SiO2 or Fe3O4 via electrostatic interactions, resulting finally into double hierarchy reinforcements. SiO2 NPs were first used as model nano-particulate objects to investigate the interfacial adhesion properties of binary coated GFs (denoted as GF-CNT/SiO2) in epoxy matrix via single fiber pull-out (SFPO) tests. The results indicated that the apparent interfacial shear strength (IFSS or τapp) was significantly increased compared to the GF-CNT. Fe3O4 NPs were assembled also onto CNT-grafted GFs resulting into GF-CNT/Fe3O4. The fibers exhibited a magnetic response upon being exposed to an external magnet. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed the surface morphologies of the different hierarchical fibers fabricated in this work. The interphase microstructure of GF-CNT and GF-CNT/SiO2 embedded in epoxy was investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The hybrid and hierarchical GFs are promising multifunctional reinforcements with appr. 85% increase of the IFSS as compared to typical amino-silane modified GFs. It could be envisaged that, among other purposes, GF-CNT/Fe3O4 could be potentially recyclable reinforcements, especially when embedded in thermoplastic polymer matrices.},

ABSTRACT = {The qualitative analysis of nanodiamonds by FTIR spectrometry as photoacoustic (FTIR–PAS), diffuse-reflectance (DRIFT), and attenuated total reflection (ATR) modalities was evaluated for rapid and nondestructive analysis and comparison of nanodiamonds. The reproducibility and signal-gathering depth of spectra was compared. The assignment of characteristic bands showed that only six groups of bands were present in spectra of all the modalities with appropriate sensitivity: 1760 (C=O stretch, isolated carboxyl groups); 1640–1632 (H–O–H bend, liquid water); 1400–1370 (non-carboxyl C–O–H in-plane bend and CH2 deformation); 1103 (non-carboxyl C–O stretch); 1060 (in-plane C–H bend, non-aromatic hydrocarbons and carbohydrates); 940 cm−1 (out-of-plane carboxyl C–O–H bend). DRIFT provides the maximum number of bands and is capable of measuring hydrogen-bonded bands and CHx groups. ATR provides the good sensitivity for water and C–H/C–C bands in the range 2000–400 cm−1. FTIR–PAS reveals less bands than DRIFT but more intense bands than ATR–FTIR and shows the maximum sensitivity for absorption bands that do not appear in ATR-IR spectra and are expedient for supporting either DRIFT or FTIR–PAS along with depth-profiling. Thus, all three modalities are required for the full characterization of nanodiamonds surface functional groups.},

ABSTRACT = {The applications of pure multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) buckypapers are still limited due to their unavoidable micro/nano-sized pores structures. In this work, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) was added to a uniform MWCNTs suspension to form MWCNT/PVA buckypapers by vacuum infiltration combined with a hot press method. The results showed an improvement in the thermal, electrical, and electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding properties due to the formation of dense MWCNTs networks. The thermal and electrical properties rose from 1.394 W/m·k to 2.473 W/m·k and 463.5 S/m to 714.3 S/m, respectively. The EMI performance reached 27.08 dB. On the other hand, ABAQUS finite element software was used to simulate the coupled temperature-displacement performance. The electronic component module with buckypapers revealed a homogeneous temperature and thermal stress distribution. In sum, the proposed method looks promising for the easy preparation of multi-functional nanocomposites at low-cost.},

ABSTRACT = {Diamond nanoparticles have been synthesized using various methods. Nanodiamonds generated in the gas phase were captured on the membrane of a transmission electron microscope grid during a hot filament chemical vapor deposition (HFCVD) diamond process. In total, ~600 nanoparticles, which were captured for 10 s in six conditions of the capture temperatures of 900 °C, 600 °C and 300 °C and the gas mixtures of 1% CH4-99% H2 and 3% CH4-97% H2, were analyzed for phase identification using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and fast Fourier transformation. Hexagonal diamond, i-carbon, n-diamond, and cubic diamond were identified. The observation of two or more carbon allotropes captured on the same membrane suggested their coexistence in the gas phase during HFCVD. The crystal structure of carbon allotropes was related to the size of the nanodiamond. The crystal structure of the nanoparticles affected the crystal structure of diamond deposited for 8 h. Confirmation of various carbon allotropes provides new insight into the nanodiamond synthesis in the gas phase and the growth mechanism of HFCVD diamond.},

X-ray diffraction analysis showed the formation of 2D monomolecular-layer nanosheets from synthesized thiacalix[4]arenes, the distance between which depends on the stereoisomer used. It was established by DSC, FSC, and PXRD methods that the obtained macrocycles are capable of forming different crystalline polymorphs, moreover dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) is contributing to the formation of a more stable polymorph for cone stereoisomer.

ABSTRACT = {The Fokker–Planck equation accurately describes AC magnetization dynamics of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs). However, the model for describing AC magnetization dynamics of MNPs based on Fokker-Planck equation is very complicated and the numerical calculation of Fokker-Planck function is time consuming. In the stable stage of AC magnetization response, there are differences in the harmonic phase and amplitude between the stable magnetization response of MNPs described by Langevin and Fokker–Planck equation. Therefore, we proposed an empirical model for AC magnetization harmonics to compensate the attenuation of harmonics amplitude induced by a high frequency excitation field. Simulation and experimental results show that the proposed model accurately describes the AC M–H curve. Moreover, we propose a harmonic amplitude–temperature model of a magnetic nanoparticle thermometer (MNPT) in a high-frequency excitation field. The simulation results show that the temperature error is less than 0.008 K in the temperature range 310–320 K. The proposed empirical model is expected to help improve MNPT performance.},

ABSTRACT = {Binary and ternary oxynitride solid alloys were studied extensively in the past decade due to their wide spectrum of applications, as well as their peculiar characteristics when compared to their bulk counterparts. Direct bottom-up synthesis of one-dimensional oxynitrides through solution-based routes cannot be realized because nitridation strategies are limited to high-temperature solid-state ammonolysis. Further, the facile fabrication of oxynitride thin films through vapor phase strategies has remained extremely challenging due to the low vapor pressure of gaseous building blocks at atmospheric pressure. Here, we present a direct and scalable catalytic vapor–liquid–solid epitaxy (VLSE) route for the fabrication of oxynitride solid solution nanowires from their oxide precursors through enhancing the local mass transfer flux of vapor deposition. For the model oxynitride material, we investigated the fabrication of gallium nitride and zinc oxide oxynitride solid solution (GaN:ZnO) thin film. GaN:ZnO nanowires were synthesized directly at atmospheric pressure, unlike the methods reported in the literature, which involved multiple-step processing and/or vacuum operating conditions. Moreover, the dimensions (i.e., diameters and length) of the synthesized nanowires were tailored within a wide range.},

ABSTRACT = {Natural products suited for prophylaxis and therapy of inflammatory diseases have gained increasing importance. These compounds could be beneficially integrated into bacterial cellulose (BC), which is a natural hydropolymer applicable as a wound dressing and drug delivery system alike. This study presents experimental outcomes for a natural anti-inflammatory product concept of boswellic acids from frankincense formulated in BC. Using esterification respectively (resp.) oxidation and subsequent coupling with phenylalanine and tryptophan, post-modification of BC was tested to facilitate lipophilic active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) incorporation. Diclofenac sodium and indomethacin were used as anti-inflammatory model drugs before the findings were transferred to boswellic acids. By acetylation of BC fibers, the loading efficiency for the more lipophilic API indomethacin and the release was increased by up to 65.6% and 25%, respectively, while no significant differences in loading could be found for the API diclofenac sodium. Post-modifications could be made while preserving biocompatibility, essential wound dressing properties and anti-inflammatory efficacy. Eventually, in vitro wound closure experiments and evaluations of the effect of secondary dressings completed the study.},

ABSTRACT = {Clean water scarcity is still an intense, prolonged global issue that needs to be resolved urgently. The solar steam generation has shown great potential with a high energy conversion efficiency for clean water production from seawater and wastewater. However, the high evaporation rate of water cannot be preserved due to the inevitable fouling of solar absorbers. Herein, a self-floatable and super hydrophilic solar-driven steam generator composed of activated carbon coated melamine foam (ACM). The deposited ACM photothermal layer exhibits outstanding solar absorption (92%) and an efficient evaporation rate of 1.27 kg m−2 h−1, along with excellent photothermal conversion efficiency (80%) as compared to commercially available primitive solar stills. The open porous assembly of melamine foam equipped with 80% flexibility (0.8 MPa) enabled smooth water transport and sustain heat accumulation within the matrix. The thermal insulation of ACM is 10 times greater than pure water. Moreover, open porous assembly of designed solar-powered steam generator rejects salt ions as well as volatile organic compounds efficiently. The low-cost and facile fabrication of photothermal based water production presents a potential solution to single step drinking water supply from various resources of the sea, the lakes and mixtures of emulsified oil and industrial wastewater.},

ABSTRACT = {Due to the excellent chemical inertness, graphene can be used as an anti-corrosive coating to protect metal surfaces. Here, we report the growth of graphene by using a chemical vapour deposition (CVD) process with ethanol as a carbon source. Surface and structural characterisations of CVD grown films suggest the formation of double-layer graphene. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy has been used to study the anticorrosion behaviour of the CVD grown graphene layer. The observed corrosion rate of 8.08 × 10−14 m/s for graphene-coated copper is 24 times lower than the value for pure copper which shows the potential of graphene as the anticorrosive layer. Furthermore, we observed no significant changes in anticorrosive behaviour of the graphene coated copper samples stored in ambient environment for more than one year.},

ABSTRACT = {During the past decade, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has risen rapidly, and it now approaches the record for single crystal silicon solar cells. However, these devices still suffer from a problem of stability. To improve PSC stability, two approaches have been notably developed: the use of additives and/or post-treatments that can strengthen perovskite structures and the use of a nontypical architecture where three mesoporous layers, including a porous carbon backcontact without hole transporting layer, are employed. This paper focuses on 5-ammonium valeric acid iodide (5-AVAI or AVA) as an additive in methylammonium lead iodide (MAPI). By combining scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL), current–voltage measurements, ideality factor determination, and in-depth electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) investigations on various layers stacks structures, we discriminated the effects of a mesoscopic scaffold and an AVA additive. The AVA additive was found to decrease the bulk defects in perovskite (PVK) and boost the PVK resistance to moisture. The triple mesoporous structure was detrimental for the defects, but it improved the stability against humidity. On standard architecture, the PCE is 16.9% with the AVA additive instead of 18.1% for the control. A high stability of TiO2/ZrO2/carbon/perovskite cells was found due to both AVA and the protection by the all-inorganic scaffold. These cells achieved a PCE of 14.4% in the present work.},

ABSTRACT = {Blueberries are popular among consumers for their high nutritional value but are highly perishable due to the microbial decay. The use of active packaging that is able to interact with the food through releasing or absorbing substances can be a valid approach to preserve the quality and increase the fruit’s shelf-life. In this paper, an active packaging based on polyethylene (PE) filled with a nano-carrier of salicylate was prepared and characterized. Fresh blueberries were packaged in passive modified atmosphere packaging (pMA) for 13 days at 8 °C. The combination of the active filler in bulk and pMA showed a significant inhibition of mold development and a reduction of the respiration rate of fruits. Moreover, the release of salicylate on blueberries did not alter the fruits’ sensory traits and preserved the firmness and the nutritional quality. Finally, the combination of active packaging and pMA resulted a valid solution to extend blueberries’ shelf-life up to 13 days.},

ABSTRACT = {High electronically conductive tungsten phosphate glass-ceramics have been prepared by the controlled crystallization of binary 60WO3–40P2O5 glass in the temperature range from 700 to 935 °C and for 1 to 24 h. The substantial increase in the conductivity for four orders of magnitude is a result of the formation of electronically conductive W2O3(PO4)2 and WO3 phases. At low crystallization temperature the dominant W2O3(PO4)2 phase is created, whereas at 935 °C for 24 h the formation of semiconducting WO3 crystallites of an average size of 80 nm enhances the conductivity to the highest value of 1.64 × 10−4 (Ω cm)–1 at 30 °C. The course of the crystallization and its impact on this exceptionally high electronic transport of binary tungsten phosphate glass-ceramics has been discussed in detail. Since such highly electronically conductive WO3-based glass-ceramics have a great potential as cathode/anode materials in solid state batteries and as electrocatalysts in fuel cells, it is of interest to provide a novel insight into the improvement of their electrical properties.},

ABSTRACT = {The leakage and volatilization of liquid electrolytes limit the commercialization of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs). As solid-state (ss) hole-transporting materials, free from leakage and volatilization, biscarbazole-based polymers with different molecular weights (PBCzA-H (21,200 g/mol) and PBCzA-L (2450 g/mol)) were applied in combination with additives to produce ssDSCs. An ssDSC with PBCzA-H showed a better short-circuit current (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), and fill factor (FF) than a device with PBCzA-L, resulting in 38% higher conversion efficiency. Compared to the PBCzA-L, the PBCzA-H with a higher molecular weight showed faster hole mobility and larger conductivity, leading to elevations in Jsc via rapid hole transport, Voc via rapid hole extraction, and FF via lowered series and elevated shunt resistances. Thus, it is believed that PBCzA-H is a useful candidate for replacing liquid electrolytes.},

ABSTRACT = {Ultra-sensitive elements for nanoscale devices capable of detecting single molecules are in demand for many important applications. It is generally accepted that the inevitable stochastic disturbance of a sensing element by its surroundings will limit detection at the molecular level. However, a phenomenon exists (stochastic resonance) in which the environmental noise acts abnormally: it amplifies, rather than distorts, a weak signal. Stochastic resonance is inherent in non-linear bistable systems with criticality at which the bistability emerges. Our computer simulations have shown that the large-scale conformational dynamics of a short oligomeric fragment of thermosrespective polymer, poly-N-isopropylmethacrylamid, resemble the mechanical movement of nonlinear bistable systems. The oligomers we have studied demonstrate spontaneous vibrations and stochastic resonance activated by conventional thermal noise. We have observed reasonable shifts of the spontaneous vibrations and stochastic resonance modes when attaching an analyte molecule to the oligomer. Our simulations have shown that spontaneous vibrations and stochastic resonance of the bistable thermoresponsive oligomers are sensitive to both the analyte molecular mass and the binding affinity. All these effects indicate that the oligomers with mechanic-like bistability may be utilized as ultrasensitive operational units capable of detecting single molecules.},

ABSTRACT = {Non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFLD) is a metabolic disorder related to a chronic lipid accumulation within the hepatocytes. This disease is the most common liver disorder worldwide, and it is estimated that it is present in up to 25% of the world’s population. However, the real prevalence of this disease and the associated disorders is unknown mainly because reliable and applicable diagnostic tools are lacking. It is known that the level of albumin, a pleiotropic protein synthesized by hepatocytes, is correlated with the correct function of the liver. The development of a complementary tool that allows direct, sensitive, and label-free monitoring of albumin secretion in hepatocyte cell culture can provide insight into NAFLD’s mechanism and drug action. With this aim, we have developed a simple integrated plasmonic biosensor based on gold nanogratings from periodic nanostructures present in commercial Blu-ray optical discs. This sensor allows the direct and label-free monitoring of albumin in a 2D fatty liver disease model under flow conditions using a highly-specific polyclonal antibody. This technology avoids both the amplification and blocking steps showing a limit of detection within pM range (≈0.26 ng/mL). Thanks to this technology, we identified the optimal fetal bovine serum (FBS) concentration to maximize the cells’ lipid accumulation. Moreover, we discovered that the hepatocytes increased the amount of albumin secreted on the third day from the lipids challenge. These data demonstrate the ability of hepatocytes to respond to the lipid stimulation releasing more albumin. Further investigation is needed to unveil the biological significance of that cell behavior.},

ABSTRACT = {The paper describes a new kind of ionogel with both good mechanical strength and high conductivity synthesized by confining the ionic liquid (IL) 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethane sulfonyl)imide ([Bmim][NTf2]) within an organic–inorganic hybrid host. The organic–inorganic host network was synthesized by the reaction of methyltrimethoxysilane (MTMS), tetraethoxysilane (TEOS), and methyl methacrylate (MMA) in the presence of a coupling agent, offering the good mechanical strength and rapid shape recovery of the final products. The silane coupling agent 3-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane (KH-570) plays an important role in improving the mechanical strength of the inorganic–organic hybrid, because it covalently connected the organic component MMA and the inorganic component SiO2. Both the thermal stability and mechanical strength of the ionogel significantly increased by the addition of IL. The immobilization of [Bmim][NTf2] within the ionogel provided the final ionogel with an ionic conductivity as high as ca. 0.04 S cm−1 at 50 °C. Moreover, the hybrid ionogel can be modified with organosilica-modified carbon dots within the network to yield a transparent and flexible ionogel with strong excitation-dependent emission between 400 and 800 nm. The approach is, therefore, a blueprint for the construction of next-generation multifunctional ionogels.},

ABSTRACT = {Leptospira infection can cause potential hazards to human health by stimulating inflammation, which is mediated mainly through the Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) pathway. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are promising for medical applications, as they display both bioinert and noncytotoxic characteristics. AuNPs have been shown to have the ability to modify immune responses. To understand the in vitro immunomodulatory effect of AuNPs in a Leptospira infection model, the activation of TLR2 expression was examined in HEK-Blue-hTLR2 cells treated with Leptospira serovars and/or AuNPs (10 and 20 nm). The ability of AuNPs to modulate an inflammatory response induced by Leptospira was examined in terms of transcript expression level modulation of three proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-6) using two-stage quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase PCR. The results revealed that the administration of 10 nm AuNPs could augment the Leptospira-induced TLR2 signaling response and upregulate the expression of all three cytokine gene transcripts, whereas the 20 nm AuNPs attenuated the TLR2 activation and expression of proinflammatory cytokines. This indicates that AuNPs can modulate inflammatory parameters in Leptospira infection and different-sized AuNPs had different immunomodulatory functions in this model.},

ABSTRACT = {We have previously demonstrated that we can grow p-type GaAs nanowires using Zn doping during gold catalyzed growth with aerotaxy. In this investigation, we show how to calculate the hole concentrations in such nanowires. We base the calculations on the Zhang–Northrup defect formation energy. Using density functional theory, we calculate the energy of the defect, a Zn atom on a Ga site, using a supercell approach. The chemical potentials of Zn and Ga in the liquid catalyst particle are calculated from a thermodynamically assessed database including Au, Zn, Ga, and As. These quantities together with the chemical potential of the carriers enable us to calculate the hole concentration in the nanowires self-consistently. We validate our theoretical results against aerotaxy grown GaAs nanowires where we have varied the hole concentration by varying the Zn/Ga ratio in the aerotaxy growth.},

ABSTRACT = {Goethite is a naturally anisotropic, antiferromagnetic iron oxide. Following its atomic structure, crystals grow into a fine needle shape that has interesting properties in a magnetic field. The needles align parallel to weak magnetic fields and perpendicular when subjected to high fields. We synthesized goethite nanorods with lengths between 200 nm and 650 nm in a two-step process. In a first step we synthesized precursor particles made of akaganeite (β-FeOOH) rods from iron(III)chloride. The precursors were then treated in a hydrothermal reactor under alkaline conditions with NaOH and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) to form goethite needles. The aspect ratio was tunable between 8 and 15, based on the conditions during hydrothermal treatment. The orientation of these particles in a magnetic field was investigated by small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). We observed that the field strength required to trigger a reorientation is dependent on the length and aspect ratio of the particles and could be shifted from 85 mT for the small particles to about 147 mT for the large particles. These particles could provide highly interesting magnetic properties to nanocomposites, that could then be used for sensing applications or membranes.},

This study reports on how fs-laser irradiation of commercially available Nb foil samples affects their superconducting behavior. DC magnetization and AC susceptibility measurements at cryogenic temperatures and with magnetic fields of different amplitude and orientation are thus analyzed and reported. This study pays special attention to the surface superconducting layer that persists above the upper critical magnetic field strength Hc2, and disappears at a higher nucleation field strength Hc3. Characteristic changes were distinguished between the surface properties of the laser-irradiated samples, as compared to the corresponding reference samples (non-irradiated). Clear correlations have been observed between the surface nanostructures and the nucleation field Hc3, which depends on the relative orientation of the magnetic field and the surface patterns developed by the laser irradiation.},

ABSTRACT = {Resorcinol-formaldehyde/titanium dioxide composite (RF/TiO2) gel was prepared simultaneously by acid catalysis and then dried to aerogel with supercritical fluid CO2. The carbon/titanium dioxide aerogel was obtained by carbonization and then converted to nanoporous titanium carbide/carbon composite aerogel via 800 °C magnesiothermic catalysis. Meanwhile, the evolution of the samples in different stages was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), an energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectrometer, a scanning electron microscope (SEM), a transmission electron microscope (TEM) and specific surface area analysis (BET). The results showed that the final product was nanoporous TiC/C composite aerogel with a low apparent density of 339.5 mg/cm3 and a high specific surface area of 459.5 m2/g. Comparing to C aerogel, it could also be considered as one type of highly potential material with efficient photothermal conversion. The idea of converting oxide–carbon composite into titanium carbide via the confining template and low-temperature magnesiothermic catalysis may provide new sight to the synthesis of novel nanoscale carbide materials.},

A novel nanocomposite structure in the form of 15×(Ti/Zr)/Si multilayer thin films, with satisfying mechanical properties and moderate biocompatibility, was deposited by ion sputtering on an Si substrate. The multilayer 15×(Ti/Zr)/Si thin films were modified by femtosecond laser pulses in air to induce the following modifications: (i) mixing of components inside of the multilayer structures, (ii) the formation of an ultrathin oxide layer at the surfaces, and (iii) surface nano-texturing with the creation of laser-induced periodic surface structure (LIPSS). The focus of this study was an examination of the novel Ti/Zr multilayer thin films in order to create a surface texture with suitable composition and structure for cell integration. Using the SEM and confocal microscopies of the laser-modified Ti/Zr surfaces with seeded cell culture (NIH 3T3 fibroblasts), it was found that cell adhesion and growth depend on the surface composition and morphological patterns. These results indicated a good proliferation of cells after two and four days with some tendency of the cell orientation along the LIPSSs.},

ABSTRACT = {We propose a nonvolatile, reconfigurable, and narrowband mid-infrared bandpass filter based on surface lattice resonance in phase-change material Ge2Sb2Te5. The proposed filter is composed of a two-dimensional gold nanorod array embedded in a thick Ge2Sb2Te5 film. Results show that when Ge2Sb2Te5 transits from the amorphous state to the crystalline state, the narrowband reflection spectrum of the proposed filter is tuned from 3.197 μm to 4.795 μm, covering the majority of the mid-infrared regime, the peak reflectance decreases from 72.6% to 25.8%, and the corresponding quality factor decreases from 19.6 to 10.3. We show that the spectral tuning range can be adjusted by varying the incidence angle or the lattice period. By properly designing the gold nanorod sizes, we also show that the quality factor can be greatly increased to 70 at the cost of relatively smaller peak reflection efficiencies, and that the peak reflection efficiency can be further increased to 80% at the cost of relatively smaller quality factors. We expect that this work will advance the engineering of Ge2Sb2Te5-based nonvalatile tunable surface lattice resonances and will promote their applications especially in reconfigurable narrowband filters.},

ABSTRACT = {The development of products for topical applications requires analyses of their skin effects before they are destined for the market. At present, the ban on animal use in several tests makes the search for in vitro models (such as artificial skin) necessary to characterize the risks involved. In this work, tissue engineering concepts were used to manufacture collagen-free three-dimensional scaffolds for cell growth and proliferation. Two different human skin models—reconstructed human epidermis and full-thickness skin—were developed from electrospun scaffolds using synthetic polymers such as polyethylene terephthalate, polybutylene terephthalate, and nylon 6/6. After the construction of these models, their histology was analyzed by H&E staining and immunohistochemistry. The results revealed a reconstructed epidermal tissue, duly stratified, obtained from the nylon scaffold. In this model, the presence of proteins involved in the epidermis stratification process (cytokeratin 14, cytokeratin 10, involucrin, and loricrin) was confirmed by immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis. The nylon reconstructed human epidermis model’s applicability was evaluated as a platform to perform irritation and corrosion tests. Our results demonstrated that this model is a promising platform to assess the potential of dermal irritation/corrosion of chemical products.},

ABSTRACT = {Graphene oxide (GO) can be defined as a single monolayer of graphite with oxygen-containing functionalities such as epoxides, alcohols, and carboxylic acids. It is an interesting alternative to graphene for many applications due to its exceptional properties and feasibility of functionalization. In this study, electrochemically exfoliated graphene oxides (EGOs) with different amounts of surface groups, hence level of oxidation, were prepared by an electrochemical two-stage approach using graphite as raw material. A complete characterization of the EGOs was carried out in order to correlate their surface topography, interlayer spacing, defect content, and specific surface area (SSA) with their electrical, thermal, and mechanical properties. It has been found that the SSA has a direct relationship with the d-spacing. The EGOs electrical resistance decreases with increasing SSA while rises with increasing the D/G band intensity ratio in the Raman spectra, hence the defect content. Their thermal stability under both nitrogen and dry air atmospheres depends on both their oxidation level and defect content. Their macroscopic mechanical properties, namely the Young’s modulus and tensile strength, are influenced by the defect content, while no correlation was found with their SSA or interlayer spacing. Young moduli values as high as 54 GPa have been measured, which corroborates that the developed method preserves the integrity of the graphene flakes. Understanding the structure-property relationships in these materials is useful for the design of modified GOs with controllable morphologies and properties for a wide range of applications in electrical/electronic devices.},

ABSTRACT = {Attrition milling is an easily scalable and environmentally friendly process used to produce Ca3Co4O9+δ nanoprecursors in a relatively short time. Sintered materials produced through the classical solid-state method, involving ball milling, show much larger grain sizes and slightly lower density than those obtained in samples produced from attrition-milled precursors. On the other hand, electrical resistivity has been drastically decreased, accompanied with a slight decrease in the Seebeck coefficient in samples obtained from these attrition-milled precursors. Moreover, the use of an attrition milling process leads to a very important reduction in processing time (around 75%), together with a slight power factor improvement of around 10%, when compared to the classically prepared samples.},

ABSTRACT = {Porous microstructure pressure sensors that are highly sensitive, reliable, low-cost, and environment-friendly have aroused wide attention in intelligent biomedical diagnostics, human–machine interactions, and soft robots. Here, an all-tissue-based piezoresistive pressure sensor with ultrahigh sensitivity and reliability based on the bottom interdigitated tissue electrode and the top bridge of a microporous tissue/carbon nanotube composite was proposed. Such pressure sensors exhibited ultrahigh sensitivity (≈1911.4 kPa−1), fast response time (<5 ms), low fatigue of over 2000 loading/unloading cycles, and robust environmental degradability. These enabled sensors can not only monitor the critical physiological signals of the human body but also realize electrothermal conversion at a specific voltage, which enhances the possibility of creating wearable thermotherapy electronics for protecting against rheumatoid arthritis and cervical spondylosis. Furthermore, the sensor successfully transmitted wireless signals to smartphones via Bluetooth, indicating its potential as reliable skin-integrated electronics. This work provides a highly feasible strategy for promoting high-performance wearable thermotherapy electronics for the next-generation artificial skin.},

ABSTRACT = {This study aimed to provide insight regarding the influence of Ce oxide nanoparticles (nCeO2) with different concentrations and two different particle sizes on the germination and root elongation in seedlings of spontaneous terrestrial species. In a bench-scale experiment, seeds of the monocot, Holcus lanatus and dicots Lychnis-flos-cuculi and Diplotaxis tenuifolia were treated with solutions containing nCeO2 25 nm and 50 nm in the range 0–2000 mg Ce L−1. The results show that nCeO2 enters within the plant tissues. Even at high concentration, nCeO2 have positive effects on seed germination and the development of the seedling roots. This study further demonstrated that the particle size had no influence on the germination of L. flos-cuculi, while in H. lanatus and D. tenuifolia, the germination percentage was slightly higher (+10%) for seeds treated with nCeO2 25 nm with respect to 50 nm. In summary, the results indicated that nCeO2 was taken up by germinating seeds, but even at the highest concentrations, they did not have negative effects on plant seedlings. The influence of the different sizes of nCeO2 on germination and root development was not very strong. It is likely that particle agglomeration and ion dissolution influenced the observed effects.},

ABSTRACT = {Pure and doped vanadia (VO2, V0.98Zr0.02O2, V0.98Ce0.02O2) samples were prepared by wet chemistry synthesis from vanadyl glycolate intermediate phase and tape casted into films. Combining in-operando grazing incidence synchrotron X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy, we studied the structural evolution of the films under isothermal conditions. The setup allowed assessment of the thermochromic functionality with continuous monitoring of the monoclinic to tetragonal transition in pure and doped vanadia phases, responsible for the transmission and reflection of light in the infrared part of the solar spectrum. The materials characterisation by X-ray diffraction beamline (MCX) goniometer demonstrated ideal performance, combining flexible geometry, high resolution, and the potential to accommodate the multi-channel equipment for in-operando characterisation. This method proved viable for evaluating the relevant structural and physical, and thereof functional properties of these systems. We revealed that dopants reduce the transition temperature by 5 °C on average. The synthetic route of the films was held responsible for the observed phase separation. The more favourable behaviour of cerium-doped sample was attributed to cerium alkoxide behaviour. In addition, structural, microstructural, thermal, and spectroscopic characterisation on powder samples was performed to gain more insight into the development of the phases that are responsible for thermochromic features in a broader range of doping ratios. The influence of the dopants on the extent of the thermochromic transition (transmission to reflection hysteresis) was also evaluated using (micro) structural, thermal and spectroscopic methods of powder samples. Characterisations showed that zirconium doping in 2, 4, and 6 mol% significantly influenced the phase composition and morphology of the precursor. Vanadium oxides other than VO2 can easily crystallise; however, a thermal treatment regime that allowed crystallisation of VO2 as a single phase was established.},

ABSTRACT = {Glyphosate is one of the most commonly used and non-selective herbicides in agriculture, which may directly pollute the environment and threaten human health. A simple and effective approach to its detection is thus quite necessary. Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectroscopy was shown to be a very effective method to approach the problem. However, sensitivity in SERS experiments is quite low, caused by different orientation/conformation of the adsorbed molecules on the metal surface, which limit its detection by using SERS. In this paper, 2‒13C‒glyphosate (hereafter: 13–GLP) was designed as a model molecule for theoretical and experimental studies of the molecule structure. Vibrational modes were assigned based on the modeling results obtained at the B3LYP/6-311++G** level by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which were performed to predict the FT‒IR and Raman spectra. Band downshifts were caused by 13C atom isotopic substitution with mass changed. Moreover, SERS spectra of 13–GLP by combining ninhydrin reaction on Ag NPs were obtained. Isotopic Raman shifts are helpful in identifying the components of each Raman band through vibrations across the molecular system. They are coupled by probe molecules and thus bind to the substrates, indirectly offering the opportunity to promote interactions with Ag NPs and reduce the complex equilibrium between different orientation/conformation of glyphosate molecules on the metal surface.},

A detailed insight of the dewetting is obtained by in situ reflection high-energy electron diffraction and ex situ scanning electron microscopy. These characterizations show that the amorphous Ge films dewet into Ge crystalline nano-islands with dynamics dominated by crystallization of the amorphous material into crystalline nano-seeds and material transport at Ge islands. Surface energy minimization determines the dewetting process of crystalline Ge and controls the final stages of the process. At very high temperatures, coarsening of the island size distribution is observed.},

ABSTRACT = {Methylmercury (MeHg+) is a mercury species that is very toxic for humans, and its monitoring and sorption from environmental samples of water are a public health concern. In this work, a combination of theory and experiment was used to rationally synthesize an ion-imprinted polymer (IIP) with the aim of the extraction of MeHg+ from samples of water. Interactions among MeHg+ and possible reaction components in the pre-polymerization stage were studied by computational simulation using density functional theory. Accordingly, 2-mercaptobenzimidazole (MBI) and 2-mercaptobenzothiazole (MBT), acrylic acid (AA) and ethanol were predicted as excellent sulfhydryl ligands, a functional monomer and porogenic solvent, respectively. Characterization studies by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) revealed the obtention of porous materials with specific surface areas of 11 m2 g−1 (IIP–MBI–AA) and 5.3 m2 g−1 (IIP–MBT–AA). Under optimized conditions, the maximum adsorption capacities were 157 µg g−1 (for IIP–MBI–AA) and 457 µg g−1 (for IIP–MBT–AA). The IIP–MBT–AA was selected for further experiments and application, and the selectivity coefficients were MeHg+/Hg2+ (0.86), MeHg+/Cd2+ (260), MeHg+/Pb2+ (288) and MeHg+/Zn2+ (1510), highlighting the material’s high affinity for MeHg+. The IIP was successfully applied to the sorption of MeHg+ in river and tap water samples at environmentally relevant concentrations.},

ABSTRACT = {The Ti3C2 nanosheet, as a new two-dimensional (2D) group, has been found to have attractive characteristics as material for electromagnetic shielding and energy storage. In this study, the nonlinear broadband absorption and ultrafast dynamics of the Ti3C2 nanosheet were investigated using nanosecond open-aperture Z-scan and transient absorption techniques. The mechanism of two-photon absorption (TPA) was revealed in the visible region (475–700 nm). At lower incident energies, nonlinear absorption could not happen. When the laser energy increased to 0.64 GW/cm2, electrons in the valence band could absorb two photons and jump to the conduction band, with TPA occurring, which meant that the sample exhibited reverse saturable absorption (RSA). In addition, when transient absorption was used to investigate the ultrafast carrier dynamics of the sample, it demonstrated that the relaxation contains a fast decay component and a slow one, which are obtained from electron–phonon and phonon–phonon interactions, respectively. Moreover, with the increasing pump fluence, the fast decay lifetime τ1 increased from 3.9 to 4.5 ps, and the slow one τ2 increased from 11.1 to 13.2 ps. These results show that the Ti3C2 nanosheet has potential applications in broadband optical limiters.},

ABSTRACT = {In this study, the process of metal cation reduction on multi-crystalline silicon in a dilute hydrofluoric acid (HF) matrix is described using Ag(I), Cu(II), Au(III) and Pt(IV). The experimental basis utilized batch tests with various solutions of different metal cation and HF concentrations and multi-crystalline silicon wafers. The metal deposition kinetics and the stoichiometry of metal deposition and silicon dissolution were calculated by means of consecutive sampling and analysis of the solutions. Several reaction mechanisms and reaction steps of the process were discussed by overlaying the results with theoretical considerations. It was deduced that the metal deposition was fastest if the holes formed during metal ion reduction could be transferred to the valence bands of the bulk and surface silicon with hydrogen termination. By contrast, the kinetics were lowest when the redox levels of the metal ion/metal half-cells were weak and the equilibrium potential of the H3O+/H2 half-cells was high. Further minima were identified at the thresholds where H3O+ reduction was inhibited, the valence transfer via valence band mechanism was limited by a Schottky barrier and the dissolution of oxidized silicon was restricted by the activity of the HF species F−, HF2− and H2F3−. The findings of the stoichiometric conditions provided further indications of the involvement of H3O+ and H2O as oxidizing agents in addition to metal ions, and the hydrogen of the surface silicon termination as a reducing agent in addition to the silicon. The H3O+ reduction is the predominant process in dilute metal ion solutions unless it is disabled due to the metal-dependent equilibrium potential of the H3O+/H2 half-cell and the energetic level of the valence bands of the silicon. As silicon is not oxidized up to the oxidation state +IV by the reduction of the metal ions and H3O+, water is suspected of acting as a secondary oxidant. The stoichiometric ratios increased up to a maximum with higher molalities of the metal ions, in the manner of a sigmoidal function. If, owing to the redox level of the metal half-cells and the energetic level of the valence band at the metal–silicon contact, the surface silicon can be oxidized, the hydrogen of the termination is the further reducing agent.},

ABSTRACT = {Background: It is difficult to assess workers’ exposure to ultrafine particles (UFP) due to the lack of personal sampling equipment available for this particle fraction. The logbook method has been proposed as a general method for exposure assessment. This method measures the time and concentration components of the time-weighted average concentration separately and could be suitable for investigation of UFP exposure. Objectives: In this study, we have assessed workers’ exposure to UFP in a ferrosilicon plant. The main tasks of the furnace workers were identified, and the logbook method was used in combination with stationary measurements of UFP taken as close to the identified task areas as possible. In order to verify the results, respirable particles were collected using stationary sampling in close proximity to the UFP measuring instrument, and personal full-shift sampling of respirable particles was performed simultaneously. Thus, exposure to respirable particles determined using the logbook method could be compared to the results of standard measurement. Methods: The particle number concentration of ultrafine particles was determined using a NanoScan SMPS. Respirable particle concentration and exposure were determined using a sampling train consisting of a pump, filter, filter cassettes, and SKC Cyclone for the respirable fraction. Attendance times for workers at each work location were registered via thorough observations made by the research team. Results: The logbook method for exposure estimation based on stationary sampling equipment made it possible to calculate UFP exposure for workers operating the furnaces at a ferrosilicon plant. The mid-size furnace and the large furnace were evaluated separately. The workers operating the largest furnace were exposed to 1.47 × 104 particles/cm3, while workers operating the mid-size furnace were exposed to 2.06 × 104 particles/cm3, with a mean of 1.74 × 104 particles/cm3. Substantial contributions from the casting area, ladle transport corridor, and both tapping areas were made. Exposure to respirable particles was 2.04 mg/m3 (logbook); 2.26 mg/m3 (personal sampling) for workers operating the large-sized furnace, 3.24 mg/m3 (logbook); 2.44 mg/m3 (personal sampling) for workers operating the medium-sized furnace, and 2.57 mg/m3 (logbook); 2.53 mg/m3(personal sampling) on average of all tappers. The average ratio of these two methods’ results was 1.02, which indicates that the logbook method could be used as a substitute for personal sampling when it is not possible to perform personal sampling, at least within this industry. Conclusions: The logbook method is a useful supplement for exposure assessment of UFP, able to identify the most polluted areas of the workplace and the contribution of different work tasks to the total exposure of workers, enabling companies to take action to reduce exposure.},

In this paper, laser-induced graphene was successfully prepared on a thin and transparent polyimide film through the DLW process. Experiments have demonstrated that interdigital thin film capacitor prepared by the DLW method has a high specific capacitance of 8.11 mF/cm2 and volume capacitance density of 3.16 F/cm3 (0.05 mA/cm2) due to the doped fluoride in the laser-induced graphene. The capacitance is about 20 times larger than the super-capacitor based non-transparent polyimide film of the same thickness. Owing to its thin, flexible, higher electrochemical characteristics, the transparent polyimide film is promising for integrating and powering portable and wearable electronics.},

ABSTRACT = {The catalytic deoxygenation of coconut oil was performed in a continuous-flow reactor over bimetallic NiCo/silicoaluminophosphate-11 (SAPO-11) nanocatalysts for hydrocarbon fuel production. The conversion and product distribution were investigated over NiCo/SAPO-11 with different applied co-reactants, i.e., water (H2O) or glycerol solution, performed under nitrogen (N2) atmosphere. The hydrogen-containing co-reactants were proposed here as in-situ hydrogen sources for the deoxygenation, while the reaction tests under hydrogen (H2) atmosphere were also applied as a reference set of experiments. The results showed that applying co-reactants to the reaction enhanced the oil conversion as the following order: N2 (no co-reactant) < N2 (H2O) < N2 (aqueous glycerol) < H2 (reference). The main products formed under the existence of H2O or glycerol solution were free fatty acids (FFAs) and their corresponding Cn−1 alkanes. The addition of H2O aids the triglyceride breakdown into FFAs, whereas the glycerol acts as hydrogen donor which is favourable to initiate hydrogenolysis of triglycerides, causing higher amount of FFAs than the former case. Consequently, those FFAs can be deoxygenated via decarbonylation/decarboxylation to their corresponding Cn−1 alkanes, showing the promising capability of the NiCo/SAPO-11 to produce hydrocarbon fuels even in the absence of external H2 source.},

ABSTRACT = {Here we report on the development and investigation of a novel multiplex assay model based on polymer microspheres (PMS) encoded with ternary AIS/ZnS quantum dots (QDs). The system was prepared via layer-by-layer deposition technique. Our studies of Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the QD-encoded microspheres and two different cyanine dyes have demonstrated that the QD photoluminescence (PL) quenching steadily increases with a decrease in the QD-dye distance. We have found that the sensitized dye PL intensity demonstrates a clear maximum at two double layers of polyelectrolytes between QDs and Dye molecules on the polymer microspheres. Time resolved PL measurements have shown that the PL lifetime decreases for the QDs and increases for the dyes due to FRET. The designed system makes it possible to record spectrally different bands of FRET-induced dye luminescence with different decay times and thereby allows for the multiplexing by wavelength and photoluminescence lifetimes of the dyes. We believe that PMS encoded with AIS/ZnS QDs have great potential for the development of new highly selective and sensitive sensor systems for multiplex analysis to detect cell lysates and body fluids’ representative biomarkers.},

ABSTRACT = {Due to its physical and chemical properties, the n-type tungsten oxide (WO3) semiconductor is a suitable photoanode for water decomposition reaction. The responses of the photoelectrochemical PEC water-splitting properties as an effect of structural and optical changes of WO3 thin films, as well as the nature of electrolyte solutions, were studied in this work. The WO3 thins films have been obtained by pulsed laser deposition (PLD) on silicon (Si(001)) covered with platinum substrates using three different laser wavelengths. As the XRD (X-ray diffraction) and XTEM (cross-section transmission electron microscopy) analysis shows, the formation of highly crystalline monocline WO3 phase is formed for the film deposited at 1064 nm wavelength and poor crystalline phases with a large ordering anisotropy, characteristic of 2D structures for the films deposited at 355 nm and 193 nm wavelengths, respectively. The photogenerated current densities Jph depend on the laser wavelength, in both alkaline and acidic electrolyte. The maximum values of the photocurrent density have been obtained for the sample prepared with laser emitting at 355 nm. This behavior can be correlated with the coherent crystallized atomic ordering that appear for long distances (10–15 nm) in the (001) plane of the monoclinic WO3 phase structure films obtained at 355 nm laser wavelength. All the samples show poor current density in dark conditions and they are very stable in both acidic and alkaline solutions. The highest photocurrent density value is obtained in acidic solution for the WO3 thin film prepared by 355 nm laser (29 mA/cm2 at 1.6 V vs. RHE (1.35 V vs. Ag/AgCl)).},

ABSTRACT = {Lignin is the second most abundant biopolymer on Earth after cellulose. Since lignin breaks down in the environment naturally, lignin nanoparticles may serve as biodegradable carriers of biocidal actives with minimal environmental footprint compared to conventional antimicrobial formulations. Here, a lignin nanoparticle (LNP) coated with chitosan was engineered. Previous studies show both lignin and chitosan to exhibit antimicrobial properties. Another study showed that adding a chitosan coating can improve the adsorption of LNPs to biological samples by electrostatic adherence to oppositely charged surfaces. Our objective was to determine if these engineered particles would elicit toxicological responses, utilizing embryonic zebrafish toxicity assays. Zebrafish were exposed to nanoparticles with an intact chorionic membrane and with the chorion enzymatically removed to allow for direct contact of particles with the developing embryo. Both mortality and sublethal endpoints were analyzed. Mortality rates were significantly greater for chitosan-coated LNPs (Ch-LNPs) compared to plain LNPs and control groups. Significant sublethal endpoints were observed in groups exposed to Ch-LNPs with chorionic membranes intact. Our study indicated that engineered Ch-LNP formulations at high concentrations were more toxic than plain LNPs. Further study is warranted to fully understand the mechanisms of Ch-LNP toxicity.},

ABSTRACT = {Electrostatically actuated nanoelectromechanical (NEM) switches hold promise for operation with sharply defined ON/OFF states, high ON/OFF current ratio, low OFF state power consumption, and a compact design. The present challenge for the development of nanoelectromechanical system (NEMS) technology is fabrication of single nanowire based NEM switches. In this work, we demonstrate the first application of CuO nanowires as NEM switch active elements. We develop bottom-up and top-down approaches for NEM switch fabrication, such as CuO nanowire synthesis, lithography, etching, dielectrophoretic alignment of nanowires on electrodes, and nanomanipulations for building devices that are suitable for scalable production. Theoretical modelling finds the device geometry that is necessary for volatile switching. The modelling results are validated by constructing gateless double-clamped and single-clamped devices on-chip that show robust and repeatable switching. The proposed design and fabrication route enable the scalable integration of bottom-up synthesized nanowires in NEMS.},

ABSTRACT = {In recent years, there has been rapid progress in the development of photonic devices based on lead halide perovskite nanocrystals since they possess a set of unique optical and charge transport properties. However, the main limiting factor for their subsequent application is poor stability against exposure to adverse environmental conditions. In this work, a study of a composite material based on perovskite CsPbBr3 nanocrystals embedded in porous silica microspheres is presented. We developed two different approaches to change the interface between nanocrystals and the surface of the microsphere pores: surface treatment of (i) nanocrystals or (ii) microspheres. The surface modification with tetraethylorthosilicate molecules not only increased stability but also improved the optical responses of the composite material. The position of the emission band remained almost unchanged, but its lifetime increased significantly compared to the initial value. The improvement of the optical performance via surface modification with tetraethylorthosilicate molecules also works for the lead-free Bi-doped Cs2AgInCl6 double perovskite nanocrystals leading to increased stability of their optical responses at ambient conditions. These results clearly demonstrate the advantage of a composite material that can be used in novel photonic devices with improved performance.},

ABSTRACT = {Layered materials in which individual atomic layers are bonded by weak van der Waals forces (vdW materials) constitute one of the most prominent platforms for materials research. Particularly, polar vdW crystals, such as hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), alpha-molybdenum trioxide (α-MoO3) or alpha-vanadium pentoxide (α-V2O5), have received significant attention in nano-optics, since they support phonon polaritons (PhPs)―light coupled to lattice vibrations― with strong electromagnetic confinement and low optical losses. Recently, correlative far- and near-field studies of α-MoO3 have been demonstrated as an effective strategy to accurately extract the permittivity of this material. Here, we use this accurately characterized and low-loss polaritonic material to sense its local dielectric environment, namely silica (SiO2), one of the most widespread substrates in nanotechnology. By studying the propagation of PhPs on α-MoO3 flakes with different thicknesses laying on SiO2 substrates via near-field microscopy (s-SNOM), we extract locally the infrared permittivity of SiO2. Our work reveals PhPs nanoimaging as a versatile method for the quantitative characterization of the local optical properties of dielectric substrates, crucial for understanding and predicting the response of nanomaterials and for the future scalability of integrated nanophotonic devices.},

ABSTRACT = {As a representative nanomaterial, C60 and its derivatives have drawn much attention in the field of drug delivery over the past years, due to their unique geometric and electronic structures. Herein, the interactions of hydroxyurea (HU) drug with the pristine C60 and heterofullerene MC59 (M = B, Si, Al) were investigated using the density functional theory calculations. The geometric and electronic properties in terms of adsorption configuration, adsorption energy, Hirshfeld charge, frontier molecular orbitals, and charge density difference are calculated. In contrast to pristine C60, it is found that HU molecule is chemisorbed on the BC59, SiC59, and AlC59 molecules with moderate adsorption energy and apparent charge transfer. Therefore, heterofullerene BC59, SiC59, and AlC59 are expected to be promising carriers for hydroxyurea drug delivery.},

ABSTRACT = {Structure of model bimetallic PdAu nanoparticles is analyzed aiming to find Pd:Au ratios optimal for existence of Pd1 single-atom surface sites inside outer Au atomic shell. The analysis is performed using density-functional theory (DFT) calculations and topological approach based on DFT-parameterized topological energy expression. The number of the surface Pd1 sites in the absence of adsorbates is calculated as a function of Pd concentration inside the particles. At low Pd contents none of the Pd atoms emerge on the surface in the lowest-energy chemical orderings. However, surface Pd1 sites become stable, when Pd content inside a Pd-Au particle reaches ca. 60%. Further Pd content increase up to almost pure Pd core is accompanied by increased concentration of surface Pd atoms, mostly as Pd1 sites, although larger Pd ensembles as dimers and linear trimers are formed as well. Analysis of the chemical orderings inside PdAu nanoparticles at different Pd contents revealed that enrichment of the subsurface shell by Pd with predominant occupation of its edge positions precedes emergence of Pd surface species.},

ABSTRACT = {Laser direct writing technique in glass is a powerful tool for various waveguides’ fabrication that highly develop the element base for designing photonic devices. We apply this technique to fabricate waveguides in porous glass (PG). Nanoporous optical materials for the inscription can elevate the sensing ability of such waveguides to higher standards. The waveguides were fabricated by a single-scan approach with femtosecond laser pulses in the densification mode, which resulted in the formation of a core and cladding. Experimental studies revealed three types of waveguides and quantified the refractive index contrast (up to Δn = 1.2·10−2) accompanied with ~1.2 dB/cm insertion losses. The waveguides demonstrated the sensitivity to small objects captured by the nanoporous framework. We noticed that the deposited ethanol molecules (3 µL) on the PG surface influence the waveguide optical properties indicating the penetration of the molecule to its cladding. Continuous monitoring of the output near field intensity distribution allowed us to determine the response time (6 s) of the waveguide buried at 400 µm below the glass surface. We found that the minimum distinguishable change of the refractive index contrast is 2 × 10−4. The results obtained pave the way to consider the waveguides inscribed into PG as primary transducers for sensor applications.},

ABSTRACT = {MXenes are two-dimensional nanomaterials isolated from MAX phases by selective extraction of the A component—a p-block element. The MAX exfoliation energy, Eexf, is considered a chemical descriptor of the MXene synthesizability. Here, we show, by density functional theory (DFT) estimations of Eexf values for 486 different MAX phases, that Eexf decreases (i) when MAX is a nitride, (ii) when going along a metal M component d series, (iii) when going down a p-block A element group, and (iv) when having thicker MXenes. Furthermore, Eexf is found to bias, even to govern, the surface chemical activity, evaluated here on the CO2 adsorption strength, so that more unstable MXenes, displaying larger Eexf values, display a stronger attachment of species upon.},

ABSTRACT = {This study addresses the combination of customized surface modification with the use of nanofluids, to infer on its potential to enhance pool-boiling heat transfer. Hydrophilic surfaces patterned with superhydrophobic regions were developed and used as surface interfaces with different nanofluids (water with gold, silver, aluminum and alumina nanoparticles), in order to evaluate the effect of the nature and concentration of the nanoparticles in bubble dynamics and consequently in heat transfer processes. The main qualitative and quantitative analysis was based on extensive post-processing of synchronized high-speed and thermographic images. To study the nucleation of a single bubble in pool boiling condition, a numerical model was also implemented. The results show an evident benefit of using biphilic patterns with well-established distances between the superhydrophobic regions. This can be observed in the resulting plot of the dissipated heat flux for a biphilic pattern with seven superhydrophobic spots, δ = 1/d and an imposed heat flux of 2132 w/m2. In this case, the dissipated heat flux is almost constant (except in the instant t* ≈ 0.9 when it reaches a peak of 2400 W/m2), whilst when using only a single superhydrophobic spot, where the heat flux dissipation reaches the maximum shortly after the detachment of the bubble, dropping continuously until a new necking phase starts. The biphilic patterns also allow a controlled bubble coalescence, which promotes fluid convection at the hydrophilic spacing between the superhydrophobic regions, which clearly contributes to cool down the surface. This effect is noticeable in the case of employing the Ag 1 wt% nanofluid, with an imposed heat flux of 2132 W/m2, where the coalescence of the drops promotes a surface cooling, identified by a temperature drop of 0.7 °C in the hydrophilic areas. Those areas have an average temperature of 101.8 °C, whilst the average temperature of the superhydrophobic spots at coalescence time is of 102.9 °C. For low concentrations as the ones used in this work, the effect of the nanofluids was observed to play a minor role. This can be observed on the slight discrepancy of the heat dissipation decay that occurred in the necking stage of the bubbles for nanofluids with the same kind of nanoparticles and different concentration. For the Au 0.1 wt% nanofluid, a heat dissipation decay of 350 W/m2 was reported, whilst for the Au 0.5 wt% nanofluid, the same decay was only of 280 W/m2. The results of the numerical model concerning velocity fields indicated a sudden acceleration at the bubble detachment, as can be qualitatively analyzed in the thermographic images obtained in this work. Additionally, the temperature fields of the analyzed region present the same tendency as the experimental results.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, WO3-Pd2Pt-Pt nanocomposite films were deposited on a single mode fiber as the hydrogen sensing material, which changes its reflectivity under different hydrogen concentration. The reflectivity variation was probed and converted to an electric signal by a pair of balanced InGaAs photoelectric detectors. In addition, the performance of the WO3-Pd2Pt-Pt composite film was investigated under different optical powers, and the irrigating power was optimized at 5 mW. With the irrigation of this optical power, the hydrogen sensitive film exhibits quick response toward 100 ppm hydrogen in air atmosphere at a room temperature of 25 °C. The experimental results demonstrate a high resolution at 5 parts per million (ppm) within a wide range from 100 to 5000 ppm in air. This simple and compact sensing system can detect hydrogen concentrations far below the explosion limit and provide early alert for hydrogen leakage, showing great potential in hydrogen-related applications.},

ABSTRACT = {All-purpose glasses are common in many established and emerging industries, such as microelectronics, photovoltaics, optical components, and biomedical devices due to their outstanding combination of mechanical, optical, thermal, and chemical properties. Surface functionalization through nano/micropatterning can further enhance glasses’ surface properties, expanding their applicability into new fields. Although laser structuring methods have been successfully employed on many absorbing materials, the processability of transparent materials with visible laser radiation has not been intensively studied, especially for producing structures smaller than 10 µm. Here, interference-based optical setups are used to directly pattern soda lime substrates through non-lineal absorption with ps-pulsed laser radiation in the visible spectrum. Line- and dot-like patterns are fabricated with spatial periods between 2.3 and 9.0 µm and aspect ratios up to 0.29. Furthermore, laser-induced periodic surface structures (LIPSS) with a feature size of approximately 300 nm are visible within these microstructures. The textured surfaces show significantly modified properties. Namely, the treated surfaces have an increased hydrophilic behavior, even reaching a super-hydrophilic state for some cases. In addition, the micropatterns act as relief diffraction gratings, which split incident light into diffraction modes. The process parameters were optimized to produce high-quality textures with super-hydrophilic properties and diffraction efficiencies above 30%.},

ABSTRACT = {FePt nanoparticles (NPs) were embedded into a single-crystal MgO host by pulsed laser deposition (PLD). It was found that its phase, microstructures and physical properties were strongly dependent on annealing conditions. Annealing induced a remarkable morphology variation in order to decrease its total free energy. H2/Ar (95% Ar + 5% H2) significantly improved the L10 ordering of FePt NPs, making magnetic coercivity reach 37 KOe at room temperature. However, the samples annealing at H2/Ar, O2, and vacuum all showed the presence of iron oxide even with the coverage of MgO. MgO matrix could restrain the particles’ coalescence effectively but can hardly avoid the oxidation of Fe since it is extremely sensitive to oxygen under the high-temperature annealing process. This study demonstrated that it is essential to anneal FePt in a high-purity reducing or ultra-high vacuum atmosphere in order to eliminate the influence of oxygen.},

ABSTRACT = {Cyclopia intermedia (C. intermedia) is an indigenous South African shrub used to prepare the popular medicinal honeybush (HB) tea. This plant contains high levels of mangiferin (MGF), a xanthonoid that was reported to have numerous biological activities, including anti-tumor activity. MGF and extracts that contain high concentrations of MGF, such as extracts from Mangifera indica L. or mango have been used to synthesize gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) using green nanotechnology. It has previously been shown that when AuNPs synthesized from M. indica L. extracts are used in combination with doxorubicin (DOX) and Ayurvedic medicine, the anti-tumor effects appear to be augmented. It has also been demonstrated that MGF used in combination with DOX resulted in enhanced anti-tumor effects. In this study, C. intermedia (HB) and MGF were used to synthesize HB-AuNPs and MGF-AuNPs, respectively. The physicochemical properties of the AuNPs were characterized by the UV-Visible Spectroscopy (UV-Vis), dynamic light scattering (DLS), Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction spectroscopy (XRD) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM). The cytotoxicity of HB-AuNPs and MGF-AuNPs were assessed on human colon (Caco-2), prostate (PC-3) and glioblastoma (U87) cancer cells; as well as normal breast epithelial (MCF-12A) cells using the MTT assay. Both HB-AuNPs and MGF-AuNPs demonstrated relatively low cytotoxicity in these cells. However, when these nanoparticles were used in combination with DOX, the cytotoxicity of DOX was significantly augmented.},

ABSTRACT = {Colloidal nanoparticles (NPs) have been recently spotlighted as building blocks for various nanostructured devices. Their collective properties have been exhibited by arranging them on a substrate to form assembled NPs. In particular, electrophoretic deposition (EPD) is an emerging fabrication method for such nanostructured films. To maximize the benefits of this method, further studies are required to fully elucidate the key parameters that influence the NP deposition. Herein, two key parameters are examined, namely: (i) the aging of colloidal NPs and (ii) the charge formation by surface ligands. The aging of Cu2-xS NPs changes the charge states, thus leading to different NP deposition behaviors. The SEM images of NP films, dynamic light scattering, and zeta potential results demonstrated that the charge control and restoration of interparticle interactions for aged NPs were achieved via simple ligand engineering. The charge control of colloidal NPs was found to be more dominant than the influence of aging, which can alter the surface charges of the NPs. The present results thus reveal that the charge formation on the colloidal NPs, which depends on the surface ligands, is an important controllable parameter in EPD.},

ABSTRACT = {A suitable way to modify the electronic properties of graphene—while maintaining the exceptional properties associated with its two-dimensional (2D) nature—is its functionalisation. In particular, the incorporation of hydrogen isotopes in graphene is expected to modify its electronic properties leading to an energy gap opening, thereby rendering graphene promising for a widespread of applications. Hence, deuterium (D) adsorption on free-standing graphene was obtained by high-energy electron ionisation of D2 and ion irradiation of a nanoporous graphene (NPG) sample. This method allows one to reach nearly 50 at.% D upload in graphene, higher than that obtained by other deposition methods so far, towards low-defect and free-standing D-graphane. That evidence was deduced by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy of the C 1s core level, showing clear evidence of the D-C sp3 bond, and Raman spectroscopy, pointing to remarkably clean and low-defect production of graphane. Moreover, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy showed the opening of an energy gap in the valence band. Therefore, high-energy electron ionisation and ion irradiation is an outstanding method for obtaining low defect D-NPG with a high D upload, which is very promising for the fabrication of semiconducting graphane on large scale.},

ABSTRACT = {Cu100−xCox thin films have been obtained by sputtering (x = 3, 9) and sputter gas aggregation (x = 2.5, 7.5) and subsequent annealing at 400 °C for 1 h. We have studied their structural, magnetic, and magnetotransport properties, both for the as-deposited and annealed samples, confirming the important role of the fabrication method in the properties. The magnetic measurements and the fitting of the hysteresis loops evidence that as-deposited samples consist of superparamagnetic (SPM) and/or ferromagnetic clusters, but in the samples obtained by gas aggregation the clusters are greater (with ferromagnetic behavior at room temperature) whereas in the samples obtained by sputtering, the clusters are smaller and there are also diluted Co atoms in the Cu matrix. The annealing affects negligibly the samples obtained by gas aggregation, but the ones obtained by sputtering are more affected, appearing greater clusters. This behavior is also reflected in the magnetoresistance (MR) measurements of the samples, with different shapes of the MR curves depending on the preparation method: more lineal in the whole range for sputtering, saturation at low fields (about 10 kOe) for gas aggregation. Finally, a Kondo-like minimum in the resistance versus temperature is found in the samples obtained by sputtering, affected by the magnetic field and the annealing. The observed Kondo-like behavior and the influence of annealing on a Kondo-like minimum in sputtered thin films have been attributed to the presence of diluted Co atoms in the Cu matrix and the Co precipitations from the Co–Cu solid solution upon annealing respectively.},

ABSTRACT = {Ice-building up on the leading edge of wings and other surfaces exposed to icing atmospheric conditions can negatively influence the aerodynamic performances of aircrafts. In the past, research activities focused on understanding icing phenomena and finding effective countermeasures. Efforts have been dedicated to creating coatings capable of reducing the adhesion strength of ice to a surface. Nevertheless, coatings still lack functional stability, and their application can be harmful to health and the environment. Pulsed laser surface treatments have been proven as a viable technology to induce icephobicity on metallic surfaces. However, a study aimed to find the most effective microstructures for reducing ice adhesion still needs to be carried out. This study investigates the variation of the ice adhesion strength of micro-textured aluminum surfaces treated using laser-based methods. The icephobic performance is tested in an icing wind tunnel, simulating realistic icing conditions. Finally, it is shown that optimum surface textures lead to a reduction of the ice adhesion strength from originally 57 kPa down to 6 kPa, corresponding to a relative reduction of ~90%. Consequently, these new insights will be of great importance in the development of functionalized surfaces, permitting an innovative approach to prevent the icing of aluminum components.},

The AuNPs were decorated with a near-infrared dye, and RGD peptides as the tumor targeting vector for αvβ3-integrin, which is overexpressed in tissue with high tumor angiogenesis. The AuNPs were evaluated in an optical imaging setting in vitro and in vivo exhibiting favorable diagnostic properties with regards to tumor cell accumulation, biodistribution, and clearance. Furthermore, the therapeutic properties of the AuNPs were evaluated in vitro on pUC19 DNA and on A431 cells concerning acute and long-term toxicity, indicating that these AuNPs could be useful as radiosensitizers in therapeutic concepts in the future.},

ABSTRACT = {Gold nanorods (GNRs) showed to be a suitable contrast agent in photoacoustics (PA), and are able to provide a tunable absorption contrast against background tissue, while a detectable PA signal can be generated from highly localized and targeted areas. A crucial issue for these imaging techniques is represented by the discrimination between exogenous and endogenous contrast and the assessment of the real PA signal magnitude. The application of image resolution/unmixing methods was implemented and optimized to recover the relative magnitude spectra and distribution maps of image constituents of the biological sample based on multivariate analysis (multivariate curve resolution—alternating least squares, MCR-ALS) in the presence of GNRs with tunable absorption properties. The proposed data analysis methodology is demonstrated on real PA images from experimental animal models and ex-vivo preparations.},

ABSTRACT = {For the development of spacecraft with long-servicing life in low earth orbit (LEO), high-temperature resistant polymer films with long-term atomic oxygen (AO) resistant features are highly desired. The relatively poor AO resistance of standard polyimide (PI) films greatly limited their applications in LEO spacecraft. In this work, we successfully prepared a series of novel AO resistant PI composite films containing nanocaged polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) components in both the PI matrix and the fillers. The POSS-containing PI matrix film was prepared from a POSS-substituted aromatic diamine, N-[(heptaisobutyl-POSS)propyl]-3,5-diaminobenzamide (DABA-POSS) and a common aromatic diamine, 4,4′-oxydianline (ODA) and the aromatic dianhydride, pyromellitic dianhydride (PMDA) by a two-step thermal imidization procedure. The POSS-containing filler, trisilanolphenyl POSS (TSP-POSS) was added with the fixed proportion of 20 wt% in the final films. Incorporation of TSP-POSS additive apparently improved the thermal stability, but decreased the high-temperature dimensional stable nature of the PI composite films. The 5% weight loss temperature (T5%) of POSS-PI-20 with 20 wt% of DABA-POSS is 564 °C, and its coefficient of linear thermal expansion (CTE) is 81.0 × 10−6/K. The former is 16 °C lower and the latter was 20.0 × 10−6/K higher than those of the POSS-PI-10 film (T5% = 580 °C, CTE = 61.0 × 10−6/K), respectively. POSS components endowed the PI composite films excellent AO resistance and self-healing characteristics in AO environments. POSS-PI-30 exhibits the lowest AO erosion yield (Es) of 1.64 × 10−26 cm3/atom under AO exposure with a flux of 2.51 × 1021 atoms/cm2, which is more than two orders of magnitude lower than the referenced PI (PMDA-ODA) film. Inert silica or silicate passivation layers were detected on the surface of the PI composite films exposed to AO.},

ABSTRACT = {The incorporation of well-dispersed graphene (G) powder to polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) bone cement has been demonstrated as a promising solution to improving its mechanical performance. However, two crucial aspects limit the effectiveness of G as a reinforcing agent: (1) the poor dispersion and (2) the lack of strong interfacial bonds between G and the matrix of the bone cement. This work reports a successful functionalisation route to promote the homogenous dispersion of G via silanisation using 3-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxy silane (MPS). Furthermore, the effects of the silanisation on the mechanical, thermal and biocompatibility properties of bone cements are presented. In comparison with unsilanised G, the incorporation of silanised G (G_MPS1 and G_MPS2) increased the bending strength by 17%, bending modulus by 15% and deflection at failure by 17%. The most impressive results were obtained for the mechanical properties under fatigue loading, where the incorporation of G_MPS doubled the Fatigue Performance Index (I) value of unsilanised G-bone cement—meaning a 900% increase over the I value of the cement without G. Additionally, to ensure that the silanisation did not have a negative influence on other fundamental properties of bone cement, it was demonstrated that the thermal properties and biocompatibility were not negatively impacted—allowing its potential clinical progression.},

ABSTRACT = {Oncolytic viruses (OVs) are emerging as promising and potential anti-cancer therapeutic agents, not only able to kill cancer cells directly by selective intracellular viral replication, but also to promote an immune response against tumor. Unfortunately, the bioavailability under systemic administration of OVs is limited because of undesired inactivation caused by host immune system and neutralizing antibodies in the bloodstream. To address this issue, a novel hyaluronic acid based redox responsive nanohydrogel was developed in this study as delivery system for OVs, with the aim to protect the OVs following systemic administration. The nanohydrogel was formulated by water in oil (W/O) nanoemulsion method and cross-linked by disulfide bonds derived from the thiol groups of synthesized thiolated hyaluronic acid. One DNA OV Ad[I/PPT-E1A] and one RNA OV Rigvir® ECHO-7 were encapsulated into the developed nanohydrogel, respectively, in view of their potential of immunovirotherapy to treat cancers. The nanohydrogels showed particle size of approximately 300–400 nm and negative zeta potential of around −13 mV by dynamic light scattering (DLS). A uniform spherical shape of the nanohydrogel was observed under the scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM), especially, the successfully loading of OV into nanohydrogel was revealed by TEM. The crosslinking between the hyaluronic acid chains was confirmed by the appearance of new peak assigned to disulfide bond in Raman spectrum. Furthermore, the redox responsive ability of the nanohydrogel was determined by incubating the nanohydrogel into phosphate buffered saline (PBS) pH 7.4 with 10 μM or 10 mM glutathione at 37 °C which stimulate the normal physiological environment (extracellular) or reductive environment (intracellular or tumoral). The relative turbidity of the sample was real time monitored by DLS which indicated that the nanohydrogel could rapidly degrade within 10 h in the reductive environment due to the cleavage of disulfide bonds, while maintaining the stability in the normal physiological environment after 5 days. Additionally, in vitro cytotoxicity assays demonstrated a good oncolytic activity of OVs-loaded nanohydrogel against the specific cancer cell lines. Overall, the results indicated that the developed nanohydrogel is a delivery system appropriate for viral drugs, due to its hydrophilic and porous nature, and also thanks to its capacity to maintain the stability and activity of encapsulated viruses. Thus, nanohydrogel can be considered as a promising candidate carrier for systemic administration of oncolytic immunovirotherapy.},

ABSTRACT = {The coupling of proteins that can assemble, recognise or mineralise specific inorganic species is a promising strategy for the synthesis of nanoscale materials with a controllable morphology and functionality. Herein, we report that apoferritin protein amyloid fibrils (APO) have the ability to assemble and/or synthesise various metal and metal compound nanoparticles (NPs). As such, we prepared metal NP–protein hybrid bioconjugates with improved optical and magnetic properties by coupling diverse gold (AuNPs) and magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (MNPs) to apoferritin amyloid fibrils and compared them to the well-known β-lactoglobulin (BLG) protein. In a second approach, we used of solvent-exposed metal-binding residues in APO amyloid fibrils as nanoreactors for the in situ synthesis of gold, silver (AgNPs) and palladium nanoparticles (PdNPs). Our results demonstrate, the versatile nature of the APO biotemplate and its high potential for preparing functional hybrid bionanomaterials. Specifically, the use of apoferritin fibrils as vectors to integrate magnetic MNPs or AuNPs is a promising synthetic strategy for the preparation of specific contrast agents for early in vivo detection using various bioimaging techniques.},

ABSTRACT = {Fabricating future materials by self-assembly of nano-building blocks programmed to generate specific lattices is among the most challenging goals of nanotechnology and has led to the recent concept of patchy particles. We report here a simple strategy to fabricate polystyrene nanoparticles with several silica patches based on the solvent-induced self-assembly of silica/polystyrene monopods. The latter are obtained with morphological yields as high as 99% by seed-growth emulsion polymerization of styrene in the presence of 100 nm silica seeds previously modified with an optimal surface density of methacryloxymethyl groups. In addition, we fabricate “magnetic” silica seeds by silica encapsulation of preformed maghemite supraparticles. The polystyrene pod, i.e., surface nodule, serves as a sticky point when the monopods are incubated in a bad/good solvent mixture for polystyrene, e.g., ethanol/tetrahydrofuran mixtures. After self-assembly, mixtures of particles with two, three, four silica or magnetic silica patches are mainly obtained. The influence of experimental parameters such as the ethanol/tetrahydrofuran volume ratio, monopod concentration and incubation time is studied. Further developments would consist of obtaining pure batches by centrifugal sorting and optimizing the relative position of the patches in conventional repulsion figures.},

On the other hand, new materials such as carbon-based materials with unique properties have become an ideal choice in sensing technology.

It was fabricated between copper electrodes by the pulsed arc discharge method. Subsequently, the constructed metal–nanoparticle–metal (MNM) contact was employed to recognize the nitrate ions. Therefore, NaNO3, Pb(NO3)2, Zn(NO3)2, and NH4NO3 samples as a usual pollutant of industrial and agricultural wastewater were examined. All nitrate compounds in ten different densities were tested and sensor I-V characteristic was investigated, which showed that all the aforesaid compounds were recognizable by the graphene nano-strand. Additionally, the proposed structure in the presence of ions was simulated and acceptable agreement between them was reported. Additionally, the proposed structure analytically was investigated, and a comparison study between the proposed model and measured results was carried out and realistic agreement reported.},

ABSTRACT = {Ni-Pt alloy thin films have been successfully synthesized and characterized; the films were prepared by the supercritical fluid chemical deposition (SFCD) technique from Ni(hfac)2·3H2O and Pt(hfac)2 precursors by hydrogen reduction. The results indicated that the deposition rate of the Ni-Pt alloy thin films decreased with increasing Ni content and gradually increased as the precursor concentration was increased. The film peaks determined by X-ray diffraction shifted to lower diffraction angles with decreasing Ni content. The deposited films were single-phase polycrystalline Ni-Pt solid solution and it exhibited smooth, continuous, and uniform distribution on the substrate for all elemental compositions as determined by scanning electron microscopy and scanning transmission electron microscopy analyses. In the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis, the intensity of the Pt 4f peaks of the films decreased as the Ni content increased, and vice versa for the Ni 2p peak intensities. Furthermore, based on the depth profiles determined by XPS, there was no evidence of atomic diffusion between Pt and Ni, which indicated alloy formation in the film. Therefore, Ni-Pt alloy films deposited by the SFCD technique can be used as a suitable model for catalytic reactions due to their high activity and good stability for various reactions.},

ABSTRACT = {Betulinic acid (BA), a natural compound with various health benefits including selective antitumor activity, has a limited applicability in vivo due to its poor water solubility and bioavailability. Thus, this study focused on obtaining a BA nano-sized formulation with improved solubility and enhanced antitumor activity using silver nanocolloids (SilCo and PEG_SilCo) as drug carriers. The synthesis was performed using a chemical method and the physicochemical characterization was achieved applying UV-Vis absorption, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Raman and photon correlation spectroscopy (PCS). The biological evaluation was conducted on two in vitro experimental models—hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) and lung cancer (A549) cell lines. The physicochemical characterization showed the following results: an average hydrodynamic diameter of 32 nm for SilCo_BA and 71 nm for PEG_SilCo_BA, a spherical shape, and a loading capacity of 54.1% for SilCo_BA and 61.9% for PEG_SilCo_BA, respectively. The in vitro assessment revealed a cell type- and time-dependent cytotoxic effect characterized by a decrease in cell viability as follows: (i) SilCo_BA (66.44%) < PEG_SilCo_BA (72.05%) < BA_DMSO (75.30%) in HepG2 cells, and (ii) SilCo_BA (75.28%) < PEG_SilCo_BA (86.80%) < BA_DMSO (87.99%) in A549 cells.

ABSTRACT = {Phase-pure, highly crystalline sub-50 nm LiNbO3 nanocrystals were prepared from a non-aqueous solvothermal process for 72 h at 230 °C and a commercial precursor solution of mixed lithium niobium ethoxide in its parent alcohol. A systematic variation of the reaction medium composition with the addition of different amounts of co-solvent including butanol, 1,3-propanediol, 1,4-butanediol, and 1,5-pentanediol resulted in the formation of nanocrystals of adjustable mean size and shape anisotropy, as demonstrated from XRD measurements and TEM imaging. Colloidal stability of ethanol- and water-based suspensions was evaluated from dynamic light scattering (DLS)/zeta potential studies and correlated with FTIR data. Thanks to the evolution in the nanocrystal size and shape distribution we observed, as well as to the available literature on the alkoxide chemistry, the reaction pathways and growth mechanisms were finally discussed with a special attention on the monomer formation rate, leading to the nucleation step. The polar, non-perovskite crystalline structure of LiNbO3 was also evidenced to play a major role in the nanocrystal shape anisotropy.},

ABSTRACT = {Designing a novel, efficient, and cost-effective nanostructure with the advantage of robust morphology and outstanding conductivity is highly promising for the electrode materials of high-performance electrochemical storage device. In this paper, a series of honeycombed perovskite-type Sr-doped LaNiO3 nanosheets with abundant porous structure were successfully synthesized by accurately controlling the Sr-doped content. The study showed that the optimal LSNO-0.4 (La0.6Sr0.4NiO3-δ) electrode exhibited excellent electrochemical performance, which showed a high capacity of 115.88 mAh g−1 at 0.6 A g−1. Furthermore, a hybrid supercapacitor device (LSNO//AC) based on LSNO-0.4 composites and activated carbon (AC) showed a high energy density of 17.94 W h kg−1, a high power density of 1600 W kg−1, and an outstanding long-term stability with 104.4% capacity retention after 16,000 cycles, showing an excellent electrochemical performance and a promising application as an electrode for energy storage.},

ABSTRACT = {MoS2@ZnO nanoheterostructures were synthesized by electrospark erosion of zinc granules in a hydrogen peroxide solution and simultaneous addition of MoS2 nanostructured powder into the reaction zone. The morphology, size of the crystallites, as well as elemental and phase composition of the prepared structures, were examined using transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction analysis. It was found that the synthesized products represent heterostructures containing MoS2 nanoparticles formed on ZnO nanoparticles. Raman spectroscopy and photoluminescence analysis were also used for characterization of the prepared heterostructures. The obtained MoS2@ZnO nanostructures revealed an intense broad emission band ranging from 425 to 625 nm for samples with different fractions of MoS2. Photocatalytic measurements showed that the maximal hydrogen evolution rate of the prepared nanoheterostructures was about 906.6 μmol·g−1·h−1. The potential of their application in photocatalytic water splitting was also estimated.},

ABSTRACT = {Electrochemical characterization of the novel sodium iron titanate Na0.9Fe0.45Ti1.55O4 was performed upon cycling in the Li-ion half-cell. The material exhibited stable cycling in the voltage range 2–4.5 V, and the number of alkali ions extracted per formula unit was approximately half of the Na stoichiometry value. Using laboratory X-ray absorption spectrometry, we measured operando Fe K-edge X-ray absorption spectra in the first 10 charge–discharge cycles and quantified the portion of charge associated with the transition metal redox reaction. Although 3d metals are commonly accepted redox-active centers in the intercalation process, we found that in all cycles the amount of oxidized and reduced Fe ions was almost 20% less than the total number of transferred electrons. Using density functional theory (DFT) simulations, we show that part of the reversible capacity is related to the redox reaction on oxygen ions.},

ABSTRACT = {Ultra-thin and continuous metallic silver films are attracting growing interest due to the applications in flexible transparent conducting electrodes. The surface morphology and structure of silver film are very important for its electrical resistivity and optical loss. Therefore, roughness control is essential for the production of ultra-thin metallic electrode film. We have investigated the effect of aluminum doping on the improvement of surface morphology of ultra-thin silver films using molecular dynamics simulations. Al-doped silver films showed smaller surface roughness than pure silver films at various substrate temperatures. When the temperature of the substrate was 600 K, the roughness of Al-doped silver film first decreased, and then increased with the increase of the incident velocity of silver atoms. Silver atoms were more likely to agglomerate on the surface of the substrate after adding aluminum atoms, as aluminum dopants promoted the immobilization of silver atoms on SiO2 substrate due to the anchoring effect. The smoother surface could be attributable to the reduced mean free path of silver due to the cage effect by the aluminum dopant.},

ABSTRACT = {The Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) method is a well-known deposition technique for the fabrication of ordered monolayer and multilayer thin films of nanomaterials onto different substrates that plays a critical role in the development of functional devices for various applications. This paper describes detailed studies about the best coating configuration for nanoparticles of a porous metal-organic framework (MOF) onto both insulating or conductive threads and nylon fiber. We design and fabricate customized polymethylmethacrylate sheets (PMMA) holders to deposit MOF layers onto the threads or fiber using the LB technique. Two different orientations, namely, horizontal and vertical, are used to deposit MIL-96(Al) monolayer films onto five different types of threads and nylon fiber. These studies show that LB film formation strongly depends on deposition orientation and the type of threads or fiber. Among all the samples tested, cotton thread and nylon fiber with vertical deposition show more homogenous monolayer coverage. In the case of conductive threads, the MOF particles tend to aggregate between the conductive thread’s fibers instead of forming a continuous monolayer coating. Our results show a significant contribution in terms of MOF monolayer deposition onto single fiber and threads that will contribute to the fabrication of single fiber or thread-based devices in the future.},

ABSTRACT = {Polymeric nanomaterials that degrade in acidic environments have gained considerable attention in nanomedicine for intracellular drug delivery and cancer therapy. Among various acid-degradable linkages, spirocyclic acetals have rarely been used to fabricate such vehicles. In addition to acid sensitivity, they benefit from conformational rigidity that is otherwise not attainable by their non-spirocyclic analogs. Herein, amphiphilic spirocyclic polyacetals are synthesized by Cu-catalyzed alkyne–azide “click” polymerization. Unlike conventional block copolymers, which often form core–shell structures, these polymers self-assemble to form core amphiphilic assemblies capable of encapsulating Nile red as a hydrophobic model drug. In vitro experiments show that while release from these materials can occur at neutral pH with preservation of their integrity, acidic pH accelerates efficient cargo release and leads to the complete degradation of assemblies. Moreover, cellular assays reveal that these materials are fully cytocompatible, interact with the plasma membrane, and can be internalized by cells, rendering them as potential candidates for cancer therapy and/or drug delivery.},

ABSTRACT = {In this work, the piezoresistive effect for a polymer nanocomposite with a highly segregated distribution of conductive filler was investigated. As a base polymer for the investigated nanocomposites, ultrahigh-molecular-weight polyethylene, processed in a solid state (below melting point), was used. Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) were used as a nanofiller forming a highly segregated structure in between polymer particles. A numerical multiscale approach based on the finite element method was proposed to predict changes in the conductive structure composed of MWCNTs in response to uniaxial deformation of the material. At the nanoscale, numerical simulations were conducted for uniformly distributed MWCNTs providing confinement of the filler to a two-dimensional layer with a high volume fraction of the filler in between two polymer particles. At the microscale, the piezoresistive response to uniaxial deformation for the three-dimensional highly segregated structure reconstructed from experimental data was investigated numerically. The embedded element method was implemented to conduct a realistic and computationally efficient simulation of MWCNT behavior during deformation of the nanocomposite. The results of numerical simulations were compared with the experimental data to prove the correctness of assumptions used in the modeling.},

All four nanoemulsions attained high encapsulation levels (over 90%). During the three-stage in vitro digestion model (including oral, gastric, and small intestine digestion phases), the PPI-emulsified nanoemulsion showed the highest lipolysis rates (117.39%) and bioaccessibility (37.39%) among the four nanoemulsions. Moreover, the PPI-emulsified nanoemulsion (with the smallest droplet size) also demonstrated the highest stability during storage and centrifugation, while those for the RBPI-emulsified nanoemulsion (with the largest droplet size) were the lowest. In addition, all four nanoemulsions showed superior oxidation stability when compared with the blank control of corn oil. The oxidation rates of the PPI- and WPI-stabilized groups were slower than the other two groups.},

ABSTRACT = {We have described for the first time the thermodynamic state of a highly confined single-phase and single-component fluid in a slit pore using Hill’s thermodynamics of small systems. Hill’s theory has been named nanothermodynamics. We started by constructing an ensemble of slit pores for controlled temperature, volume, surface area, and chemical potential. We have presented the integral and differential properties according to Hill, and used them to define the disjoining pressure on the new basis. We identified all thermodynamic pressures by their mechanical counterparts in a consistent manner, and have given evidence that the identification holds true using molecular simulations. We computed the entropy and energy densities, and found in agreement with the literature, that the structures at the wall are of an energetic, not entropic nature. We have shown that the subdivision potential is unequal to zero for small wall surface areas. We have showed how Hill’s method can be used to find new Maxwell relations of a confined fluid, in addition to a scaling relation, which applies when the walls are far enough apart. By this expansion of nanothermodynamics, we have set the stage for further developments of the thermodynamics of confined fluids, a field that is central in nanotechnology.},

ABSTRACT = {Metal engineering structures are commonly covered and protected by coatings. However, the early local corrosion under the coatings and at defects is difficult to detect and discover. Visibility to the naked eye means that corrosion has already developed and expanded. Therefore, it is practical significant to detect the early corrosion of coated metal. Based on the formation of iron ions and anodic acidification in the local corrosion process, iron ions and proton responsive fluorescent rhodamine B acylhydrazone on-off probes are prepared by newly improved methods and denoted as RBA. RBA are loaded on the surface and in the lattice cage of zeolite (ZEO) to protect RBA from premature exposure to the corrosive environment and fluorescence quenching. In corrosive environments, the RBA loaded on the surface are released and complex with iron ions in the environment to activate fluorescence characteristics. Simultaneously, due to the cation exchange of ZEO, iron ions enter the lattice cage of ZEO and combine with RBA in the lattice cage to turn on fluorescence. When applied in epoxy coatings, the RBA/ZEO effectively indicate the occurrence of corrosion under the coatings and at defects, and accurately locate the corrosion site. Nano-scale ZEO (or RBA/ZEO) fill the micropores such as pinholes and defects of the coatings, and increase the difficulty of diffusion and penetration of corrosive media into the coatings. The application of RBA/ZEO functional filler not only do not weaken the main anti-corrosion performance of the coatings, but also significantly improve it.},

ABSTRACT = {The present paper reports a novel approach for fabrication of eco-friendly ZnO nanoparticles onto three-dimensional (3D)-printed polylactic acid (PLA) scaffolds/structures. Several alcohol-based traditional Greek liquors were used to achieve the corrosion of metallic zinc collected from a typical galvanic anode to obtain photocatalytic active nanostructured ZnO, varying from water, to Greek “ouzo” and “raki”, and pure ethanol, in combination with “Baker’s ammonia” (ammonium bicarbonate), sold worldwide in every food store. The photocatalytic active ZnO nanostructures onto three-dimensional (3D)-printed PLA scaffolds were used to achieve the degradation of 50 ppm paracetamol in water, under UV irradiation. This study provides evidence that following the proposed low-cost, eco-friendly routes for the fabrication of large-scale photocatalysts, an almost 95% degradation of 50 ppm paracetamol in water can be achieved, making the obtained 3D ZnO/PLA structures excellent candidates for real life environmental applications. This is the first literature research report on a successful attempt of using this approach for the engineering of low-cost photocatalytic active elements for pharmaceutical contaminants in waters.},

ABSTRACT = {We experimentally and theoretically investigated the effects of ionizing radiation on a stack of graphene sheets separated by polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) slabs. The exceptional absorption ability of such a heterostructure in the THz range makes it promising for use in a graphene-based THz bolometer to be deployed in space. A hydrogen/carbon ion beam was used to simulate the action of protons and secondary ions on the device. We showed that the graphene sheets remain intact after irradiation with an intense 290 keV ion beam at the density of 1.5 × 1012 cm−2. However, the THz absorption ability of the graphene/PMMA multilayer can be substantially suppressed due to heating damage of the topmost PMMA slabs produced by carbon ions. By contrast, protons do not have this negative effect due to their much longer mean free pass in PMMA. Since the particles’ flux at the geostationary orbit is significantly lower than that used in our experiments, we conclude that it cannot cause tangible damage of the graphene/PMMA based THz absorber. Our numerical simulations reveal that, at the geostationary orbit, the damaging of the graphene/PMMA multilayer due to the ions bombardment is sufficiently lower to affect the performance of the graphene/PMMA multilayer, the main working element of the THz bolometer, which remains unchanged for more than ten years.},

ABSTRACT = {In the pursuit of designing a linear soft actuator with a high force-to-weight ratio and a stiffening behavior, this paper analyzes the electrostrictive effect of the poly(vinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene-chlorotrifluoroethylene) polymer in the form of film and aligned electrospun nanofiber mat. An experimental setup is realized to evaluate the electrostrictive effect of the specimens disjointly from the Maxwell stress. In particular, an uniaxial load test is designed to evaluate the specimens’ forces produced by their axial contraction (i.e., the electrostrictive effect) when an external electric field is applied, while an uniaxial tensile load test is designed to show the specimens’ stiffening properties. This electro-mechanical analysis demonstrates that both the film and the nanofiber mat are electrostrictive, and that the nanofiber mat exhibits a force-to-weight ratio ∼65% higher than the film and, therefore, a larger electrostrictive effect. Moreover, both the film and the nanofiber mat show a stiffening behavior, which is more evident for the nanofiber mat than the film and is proportional to the weight of the material. This study concludes that, thanks to its electro-mechanical properties, the poly(vinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene-chlorotrifluoroethylene), especially in the form of aligned electrospun nanofiber mat, has high potential to be used as electro-active polymer for soft actuators in biomedical and biorobotics applications.},

ABSTRACT = {The synthesis of silica nanoparticles (SiNPs) decorated on their surface with a range of various elements (e.g., ligands, drugs, fluorophores, vectors, etc.) in a controlled ratio remains a big challenge. We have previously developed an efficient strategy to obtain in one-step, well-defined multifunctional fluorescent SiNPs displaying fluorophores and two peptides ligands as targeting elements, allowing selective detection of cancer cells. In this paper, we demonstrate that additional level of controlled multifunctionality can be achieved, getting even closer to the original concept of “magic bullet”, using solely sol–gel chemistry to achieve conjugation of PEG chains for stealth, along with three different ligands. In addition, we have answered the recurrent question of the surface ungrafting by investigating the stability of different siloxane linkages with the ERETIC Method (Electronic Reference to Access In Vivo Concentrations) by 19F NMR quantification. We also compared the efficiency of the hybrid silylated fluorophore covalent linkage in the core of the SiNP to conventional methods. Finally, the tumor-cell-targeting efficiency of these multi-ligand NPs on human endothelial cells (HUVEC or HDMEC) and mixed spheroids of human melanoma cells and HUVEC displaying different types of receptors were evaluated in vitro.},

ABSTRACT = {The nanowire platform offers great opportunities for improving the quality and range of applications of semiconductor quantum wells and dots. Here, we present the self-catalyzed growth of InAs/InSb/InAs axial heterostructured nanowires with a single defect-free InSb quantum dot, on Si substrates, by chemical beam epitaxy. A systematic variation of the growth parameters for the InAs top segment has been investigated and the resulting nanowire morphology analyzed. We found that the growth temperature strongly influences the axial and radial growth rates of the top InAs segment. As a consequence, we can reduce the InAs shell thickness around the InSb quantum dot by increasing the InAs growth temperature. Moreover, we observed that both axial and radial growth rates are enhanced by the As line pressure as long as the In droplet on the top of the nanowire is preserved. Finally, the time evolution of the diameter along the entire length of the nanowires allowed us to understand that there are two In diffusion paths contributing to the radial InAs growth and that the interplay of these two mechanisms together with the total length of the nanowires determine the final shape of the nanowires. This study provides insights in understanding the growth mechanisms of self-catalyzed InSb/InAs quantum dot nanowires, and our results can be extended also to the growth of other self-catalyzed heterostructured nanowires, providing useful guidelines for the realization of quantum structures with the desired morphology and properties.},

ABSTRACT = {With the growth of nanotechnologies, concerns raised regarding the potential adverse effects of nanoparticles (NPs), especially on the respiratory tract. Adverse outcome pathways (AOP) have become recently the subject of intensive studies in order to get a better understanding of the mechanisms of NP toxicity, and hence hopefully predict the health risks associated with NP exposure. Herein, we propose a putative AOP for the lung toxicity of NPs using emerging nanomaterials called carbon dots (CDs), and in vivo and in vitro experimental approaches. We first investigated the effect of a single administration of CDs on mouse airways. We showed that CDs induce an acute lung inflammation and identified airway macrophages as target cells of CDs. Then, we studied the cellular responses induced by CDs in an in vitro model of macrophages. We observed that CDs are internalized by these cells (molecular initial event) and induce a series of key events, including loss of lysosomal integrity and mitochondrial disruption (organelle responses), as well as oxidative stress, inflammasome activation, inflammatory cytokine upregulation and macrophage death (cellular responses). All these effects triggering lung inflammation as tissular response may lead to acute lung injury.},

This paper numerically investigates the transient behavior of two-phase flow with liquid phase change in the porous media, which consists of a series of connected pores at micro and nanoscale with the transient form of the semi-mixed model and self-compiled programs. Transient variation and spatial distribution of structure temperature, thermal non-equilibrium characteristic, phase change location and fluid-driven pressure are obtained and analyzed, and effects of initial system temperature, structure parameter and material property on the transient behaviors of two-phase flow and fluid-structure coupling heat transfer are discussed. The numerical simulations indicate that the two-phase flow with phase change in porous media is complex and ever-changing before reaching a steady state and affected by the above-mentioned three kinds of parameters significantly. Particularly, distinct phenomena of transient heat transfer deterioration and vapor block are discovered, and it is revealed that the transient heat transfer deterioration and vapor block are more serious in a porous matrix with smaller porosity and made of materials with higher heat capacity and density.},

ABSTRACT = {This article is focused on the evaluation of surface properties of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) nanotextile and a tetrafluoroethylene-perfluoro(alkoxy vinyl ether) (PFA) film and their surface activation with argon plasma treatment followed with silver nanoclusters deposition. Samples were subjected to plasma modification for a different time exposure, silver deposition for different time periods, or their combination. As an alternative approach, the foils were coated with poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA) and silver. The following methods were used to study the surface properties of the polymers: goniometry, atomic force microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron microscopy. By combining the aforementioned methods for material surface modification, substrates with antibacterial properties eliminating the growth of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria were prepared. Studies of antimicrobial activity showed that PTFE plasma-modified samples coated with PLLA and deposited with a thin layer of Ag had a strong antimicrobial effect, which was also observed for the PFA material against the bacterial strain of S. aureus. Significant antibacterial effect against S. aureus, Proteus sp. and E. coli has been demonstrated on PTFE nanotextile plasma-treated for 240 s, coated with PLLA, and subsequently sputtered with thin Ag layer.},

ABSTRACT = {We study the transport and the superconducting dynamics in a layer of type II superconductor (SC) with a normal top layer that hosts a helical magnetic ordering that gives rise to spin-current-driven ferroelectric polarization. Proximity effects akin to this heterostructure result in an anisotropic supercurrent transport and modify the dynamic properties of vortices in the SC. The vortices can be acted upon and controlled by electric gating or other means that couple to the spin ordering in the top layer, which, in turn, alter the superconducting/helical magnet coupling characteristics. We demonstrate, using the time dependent Ginzburg–Landau approach, how the spin helicity of the top layer can be utilized for pinning and guiding the vortices in the superconducting layer.},
