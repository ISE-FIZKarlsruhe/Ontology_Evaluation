SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for several million deaths to date globally, and both fomite transmission from surfaces as well as airborne transmission from aerosols may be largely responsible for the spread of the virus. Here, nanoparticle coatings of three antimicrobial materials (Ag, CuO and ZnO) are deposited on both solid flat surfaces as well as porous filter media, and their activity against SARS-CoV-2 viability is compared with a viral plaque assay. These nanocoatings are manufactured by aerosol nanoparticle self-assembly during their flame synthesis. Nanosilver particles as a coating exhibit the strongest antiviral activity of the three studied nanomaterials, while copper oxide exhibits moderate activity, and zinc oxide does not appear to significantly reduce the virus infectivity. Thus, nanosilver and copper oxide show potential as antiviral coatings on solid surfaces and on filter media to minimize transmission and super-spreading events while also providing critical information for the current and any future pandemic mitigation efforts.
