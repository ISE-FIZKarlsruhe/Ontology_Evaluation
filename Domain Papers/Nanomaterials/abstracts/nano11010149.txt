Magnetic hyperthermia on core-shell nanoparticles bears promising achievements, especially in biomedical applications. Here, thanks to magnetic hyperthermia, γ-Fe2O3 cores are able to release a DNA target mimicking the liver specific oncotarget miRNA-122. Our silica coated magnetic nanoparticles not only allow the grafting at their surface of a significant number of oligonucleotides but are also shown to be as efficient, by local heating, as 95 °C global heating when submitted to an alternative magnetic field, while keeping the solution at 28 °C, crucial for biological media and energy efficiency. Moreover, a slight modification of the silica coating process revealed an increased heating power, well adapted for the release of small oligonucleotides such as microRNA.
