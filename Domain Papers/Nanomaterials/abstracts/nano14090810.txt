A novel biomass-based magnetic nanoparticle (Fe3O4-P-CMC/PAMAM) was synthesized by crosslinking carboxymethyl chitosan (CMC) and poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM), followed by phosphorylation with the incorporation of magnetic ferric oxide nanoparticles. The characterization results verified the successful functionalization and structural integrity of the adsorbents with a surface area of ca. 43 m2/g. Batch adsorption experiments revealed that the adsorbent exhibited a maximum adsorption capacity of 1513.47 mg·g−1 for U(VI) at pH 5.5 and 298.15 K, with Fe3O4-P-CMC/G1.5-2 showing the highest affinity among the series. The adsorption kinetics adhered to a pseudo-second-order model (R2 = 0.99, qe,exp = 463.81 mg·g−1, k2 = 2.15×10−2 g·mg−1·min−1), indicating a chemically driven process. Thermodynamic analysis suggested that the adsorption was endothermic and spontaneous (ΔH° = 14.71 kJ·mol−1, ΔG° = −50.63 kJ·mol−1, 298. 15 K), with increasing adsorption capacity at higher temperatures. The adsorbent demonstrated significant selectivity for U(VI) in the presence of competing cations, with Fe3O4-P-CMC/G1.5-2 showing a high selectivity coefficient. The performed desorption and reusability tests indicated that the adsorbent could be effectively regenerated using 1M HCl, maintaining its adsorption capacity after five cycles. XPS analysis highlighted the role of phosphonate and amino groups in the complexation with uranyl ions, and validated the existence of bimodal U4f peaks at 380.1 eV and 390.1 eV belonging to U 4f7/2 and U 4f5/2. The results of this study underscore the promise of the developed adsorbent as an effective and selective material for the treatment of uranium-contaminated wastewater.
