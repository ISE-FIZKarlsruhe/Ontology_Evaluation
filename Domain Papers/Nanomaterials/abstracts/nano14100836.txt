In order to prepare biomass-derived carbon materials with high specific capacitance at a low activation temperature (≤700 °C), nanoporous carbon materials were prepared from zanthoxylum bungeanum peels and seeds via the pyrolysis and KOH-activation processes. The results show that the optimal activation temperatures are 700 °C and 600 °C for peels and seeds. Benefiting from the hierarchical pore structure (micropores, mesopores, and macropores), the abundant heteroatoms (N, S, and O) containing functional groups, and plentiful electrochemical active sites, the PAC-700 and SAC-600 derive the large capacities of ~211.0 and ~219.7 F g−1 at 1.0 A g−1 in 6 M KOH within the three-electrode configuration. Furthermore, the symmetrical supercapacitors display a high energy density of 22.9 and 22.4 Wh kg−1 at 7500 W kg−1 assembled with PAC-700 and SAC-600, along with exceptional capacitance retention of 99.1% and 93.4% over 10,000 cycles at 1.0 A g−1. More significantly, the contribution here will stimulate the extensive development of low-temperature activation processes and nanoporous carbon materials for electrochemical energy storage and beyond.
