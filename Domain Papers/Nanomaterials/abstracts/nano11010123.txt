Laser direct writing technique in glass is a powerful tool for various waveguides’ fabrication that highly develop the element base for designing photonic devices. We apply this technique to fabricate waveguides in porous glass (PG). Nanoporous optical materials for the inscription can elevate the sensing ability of such waveguides to higher standards. The waveguides were fabricated by a single-scan approach with femtosecond laser pulses in the densification mode, which resulted in the formation of a core and cladding. Experimental studies revealed three types of waveguides and quantified the refractive index contrast (up to Δn = 1.2·10−2) accompanied with ~1.2 dB/cm insertion losses. The waveguides demonstrated the sensitivity to small objects captured by the nanoporous framework. We noticed that the deposited ethanol molecules (3 µL) on the PG surface influence the waveguide optical properties indicating the penetration of the molecule to its cladding. Continuous monitoring of the output near field intensity distribution allowed us to determine the response time (6 s) of the waveguide buried at 400 µm below the glass surface. We found that the minimum distinguishable change of the refractive index contrast is 2 × 10−4. The results obtained pave the way to consider the waveguides inscribed into PG as primary transducers for sensor applications.
