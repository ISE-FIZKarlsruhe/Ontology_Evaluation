ABSTRACT = {The mechanical and electrical characteristics of films, buckypapers and fiber materials from combinations of clay, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and chitosan are described. The rheological time-dependent characteristics of clay are maintained in clay–carbon nanotube–chitosan composite dispersions. It is demonstrated that the addition of chitosan improves their mechanical characteristics, but decreases electrical conductivity by three-orders of magnitude compared to clay–CNT materials. We show that the electrical response upon exposure to humid atmosphere is influenced by clay-chitosan interactions, i.e., the resistance of clay–CNT materials decreases, whereas that of clay–CNT–chitosan increases.},

ABSTRACT = {The fabrication and characterization of template silver nanoshell structures and the encapsulation of gold nanoparticles using biocompatible poly(oxyethylene)-poly(butylene) diblock co-polymer vesicles is described in this work. These vesicles have a narrow diameter size distribution around 200 nm. Silver nanoparticles (Ø = 1–10 nm) functionalized with decanethiol were successfully entrapped in the hydrophobic membrane and non-functionalized gold nanoparticles (Ø = 3.0–5.5 nm) were encapsulated in the vesicle core. Transmission Electron Microscopy confirms the localisation of the particles; silver functionalized nanoparticles appear to thicken the vesicle membrane as shown with TEM image analysis. The enhancement of the optical properties is confirmed using transmission spectrophotometry; the 430 nm plasmon resonance peak of the silver nanoparticles was replaced by a broader extinction spectrum to beyond 700 nm (O.D. = 0.8). For a number density of 4.8 x 1012 mL-1 the scattering cross section was calculated to be 0.92 x 10-4 μm2 with a scattering coefficient of 0.44 mm-1. The measurements indicate scattering cross section of 3.8 x 10-5 μm2, attenuation coefficient of 0.18 mm-1 and extinction efficiency equal to 1.2 x 10-3. Stable and biocompatible block co-polymer vesicles can potentially be used as plasmon-resonant optical contrast agents for biomedical applications.},

ABSTRACT = {The construction of heterojunctions provides a promising strategy to improve photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. However, how to fabricate a nanoscale TiO2/g-C3N4 heterostructure and hinder the aggregation of bulk g-C3N4 using simple methods remains a challenge. In this work, we use a simple in situ construction method to design a heterojunction model based on molecular self-assembly, which uses a small molecule matrix for self-integration, including coordination donors (AgNO3), inorganic titanium source (Ti(SO4)2) and g-C3N4 precursor (melamine). The self-assembled porous g-C3N4 nanotube can hamper carrier aggregation and it provides numerous catalytic active sites, mainly via the coordination of Ag+ ions. Meanwhile, the TiO2 NPs are easily mineralized on the nanotube template in dispersive distribution to form a heterostructure via an N–Ti bond of protonation, which contributes to shortening the interfacial carrier transport, resulting in enhanced electron-hole pairs separation. Originating from all of the above synergistic effects, the obtained Ag/TiO2/g-C3N4 heterogenous photocatalysts exhibit an enhanced H2 evolution rate with excellent sustainability 20.6-fold-over pure g-C3N4. Our report provides a feasible and simple strategy to fabricate a nanoscale heterojunction incorporating g-C3N4, and has great potential in environmental protection and water splitting.},

ABSTRACT = {Here, we report the synthesis of copper–manganese alloy (CuMnO2) using graphitic carbon nitride (gCN) as a novel support material. The successful formation of CuMnO2-gCN was confirmed through spectroscopic, optical, and other characterization techniques. We have applied this catalyst as the energy storage material in the alkaline media and it has shown good catalytic behavior in supercapacitor applications. The CuMnO2-gCN demonstrates outstanding electrocapacitive performance, having high capacitance (817.85 A·g−1) and well-cycling stability (1000 cycles) when used as a working electrode material for supercapacitor applications. For comparison, we have also used the gCN and Cu2O-gCN for supercapacitor applications. This study proposes a simple path for the extensive construction of self-attaining double metal alloy with control size and uniformity in high-performance energy-storing materials.},

ABSTRACT = {Conventional optics suffer from the diffraction limit. Our recent work has predicted a nanoslit-based two-dimensional (2D) lens with transverse-electric (TE) polarized design that is capable of realizing the super-resolution focusing of light beyond the diffraction limit in the quasi-far field. Furthermore, the super-resolution capability can be kept in a high-refractive-index dielectric over a wide wavelength range from ultraviolet to visible light. Here, we systematically investigate the influence of various factors on the super-resolution focusing performance of the lens. Factors such as lens aperture, focal length and nanoslit length are considered. In particular, the influence of nanoslit length on lens focusing was ignored in the previous reports about nanoslit-based 2D lenses, since nanoslit length was assumed to be infinite. The numerical results using the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method demonstrate that the super-resolution focusing capability of a nanoslit-based 2D lens increases with the lens aperture and reduces with the increase of the lens focal length. On the other hand, it is notable that the length of the lens focus is not equal to but smaller than that of the nanoslits. Therefore, in order to achieve a desired focus length, a lens should be designed with longer nanoslits.},

ABSTRACT = {Thermal stability of core-shell structured nanoparticles is of vital importance to their practical applications at elevated temperature. Understanding the evolution of chemical distribution and the crystal structure of core-shell nanostructures with temperature variation at the nanoscale will open the route for practical applications and property enhancement of nanoparticles through proper design of new nanomaterials. In this study, core-shell non-stoichiometric Cu5FeS4 icosahedral nanoparticles were investigated by in situ heating transmission electron microscopy. Compared to the high structural and compositional stability at room temperature, the interdiffusion of Cu and Fe atoms became significant, ending up with disappearance of chemical difference in the core and shell over 300 °C. In contrast, different crystal structures of the core and shell were preserved even after heating at 350 °C, indicating the high structural stability. The inconsistency between chemical composition and crystal structure should be ascribed to the interaction between the intrinsic strain existing in the icosahedrons and various structures of this material system. In other words, the geometrically intrinsic strain of the nano-icosahedrons is helpful to modulate/maintain the core-shell structure. These findings open new opportunities for revealing the thermal stability of core-shell nanostructures for various applications and are helpful for the controllable design of new core-shell nanostructures.},

Specimens were tested by thermal imaging, electrical resistance analyses, and magnetic field tests. The experimental parameters were the concentration of MWCNT and the grout filling rate. The filling rate was investigated by measuring resistance and magnetic field changes with respect to cross-sectional area, taking the voids into consideration. The results of the thermal image tests indicate that 1.0 wt % MWCNT cement grout is optimal for void detection.},

The possibility of encapsulating spore forms of Bacillus subtilis in polystyrenesulfonate sodium/ polyallylamine hydrochloride (PSS/PAH) polyelectrolyte microcapsules was demonstrated. The activation and growth on a nutrient medium of encapsulated bacterial spores led to 60% degradation of the microcapsules nanoscale membrane shell. As a result, 18.5% of Fluorescein isothiocyanatedextran was encapsulated into polyelectrolyte microcapsules, and 28.6% of the encapsulated concentration of FITC-dextran was released into the solution.},

ABSTRACT = {Fiber-type dye-sensitized solar cells (FDSSCs) are attractive as an energy source of soft electronics due to low-costs, non-toxicity and especially, their indoor-weak-light workable features. The TiO2 nanotube array (TNA) can grow on flexible Ti wires directly using anodization technique, which is convenient and can provide better contact between substrate/TiO2. However, a systematic study of assembling efficient TNA on photoanode of FDSSC is limited. This study investigated the anodization voltage and time effects of growing TNA on Ti wires. TiO2 nanoparticles (TNP) are fabricated on TNA using dip-coating technique to compensate for low dye adsorption of TNA. Dip-coating rate is varied to optimize TNP thicknesses to provide effective dye adsorption and charge-transfer routes. The highest photon-to-electricity conversion efficiency (η) of 3.31% was obtained for FDSSCs with TNA/TNP photoanode prepared using 60 V as the anodization voltage and 40 cm/min as the dip-coating rate. The influence of titanium wire diameter on η of FDSSCs was studied. The bending test was carried out on flexible FDSSC assembled using plastic tube. The photocurrent retention of 84% is achieved for flexible FDSSC bended for 10 times. This work firstly provides facile ways to assemble efficient photoanode with composite TiO2 structures for FDSSC and opens new insights on studying titanium wire natures on FDSSC performance.},

ABSTRACT = {Transparent and conducting thin films were deposited on soda lime glass by RF magnetron sputtering without intentional substrate heating using an aluminum doped zinc oxide target of 2 inch in diameter. The sheet resistance, film thickness, resistivity, averaged transmittance and energy band gaps were measured with 2 mm spatial resolution for different target-to-substrate distances, discharge pressures and powers. Hall mobility, carrier concentration, SEM and XRD were performed with a 3 mm spatial resolution. The results reveal a very narrow range of parameters that can lead to reasonable resistivity values while the transmittance is much less sensitive and less correlated with the already well-documented negative effects caused by a higher concentration of oxygen negative ions and atomic oxygen at the erosion tracks. A possible route to improve the thin film properties requires the need to reduce the oxygen negative ion energy and investigate the growth mechanism in correlation with spatial distribution of thin film properties and plasma parameters.},

ABSTRACT = {Many disinfection technologies have emerged recently in water treatment industry, which are designed to inactivate water pathogens with extraordinary efficiency and minimum side effects and costs. Current disinfection processes, including chlorination, ozonation, UV irradiation, and so on, have their inherent drawbacks, and have been proven ineffective under certain scenarios. Bacterial inactivation by noble metals has been traditionally used, and copper is an ideal candidate as a bactericidal agent owing to its high abundance and low cost. Building on previous findings, we explored the bactericidal efficiency of Cu(I) and attempted to develop it into a novel water disinfection platform. Nanosized copper ferrite was synthesized, and it was reduced by hydroxylamine to form surface bound Cu(I) species. Our results showed that the generated Cu(I) on copper ferrite surface could inactivate E. coli at a much higher efficiency than Cu(II) species. Elevated reactive oxygen species’ content inside the cell primarily accounted for the strong bactericidal role of Cu(I), which may eventually lead to enhanced oxidative stress towards cell membrane, DNA, and functional proteins. The developed platform in this study is promising to be integrated into current water treatment industry.},

ABSTRACT = {The main objective of this study is to design and characterize silver suspensions based on poly(ethylene glycol) PEG400, Ag/PEG400, as energy storage media for low-temperature applications. A polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) treatment was applied to ~22 nm silver nanoparticles to ensure good stability in poly(ethylene glycol). An array of different experimental techniques was utilized to analyze the molecular mass and purity of base poly(ethylene glycol), morphology of dry PVP-capped Ag nanoparticles, hydrodynamic average size of dispersed Ag particles, as well as thermal stability of PEG400 and Ag/PEG400 dispersions. Samples exhibited good temporal stabilities with average hydrodynamic diameter around 50 nm according to dynamic light scattering analyses. Melting and solidification transitions were investigated in terms of temperature and enthalpy from differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) thermograms. The thermophysical characterization was completed with thermal conductivity (k), dynamic viscosity (η), isobaric heat capacity (Cp), density (ρ), and surface tension (σ) measurements of designed materials using a Hot Disk thermal conductivimeter, a rotational rheometer, a DSC calorimeter working with a quasi-isothermal modulated method, a U-tube densimeter and a drop shape analyzer, respectively. For a nanoparticle loading of only 1.1% in mass, sub-cooling reduced by 7.1% and thermal conductive improved by 3.9%, with almost no penalization in dynamic viscosity (less than 5.4% of increase). Maximum modifications in Cp, ρ, and σ were 0.9%, 2.2%, and 2.2%, respectively. Experimental results were compared with the values provided by using different theoretical or semi-empirical equations. In particular, good descriptions of dynamic viscosity as functions of temperature and nanoparticle volume concentration were obtained by using the Vogel–Fulcher–Tammann equation and a first-order polynomial η( ϕ v , n p ) correlation, with absolute average deviations of 2.2% and 0.55%, respectively.},

ABSTRACT = {Amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP) has shown significant effects on the biomineralization and promising applications in bio-medicine. However, the limited stability and porosity of ACP material restrict its practical applications. A storage stable highly porous ACP with Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface area of over 400 m2/g was synthesized by introducing phosphoric acid to a methanol suspension containing amorphous calcium carbonate nanoparticles. Electron microscopy revealed that the porous ACP was constructed with aggregated ACP nanoparticles with dimensions of several nanometers. Large angle X-ray scattering revealed a short-range atomic order of <20 Å in the ACP nanoparticles. The synthesized ACP demonstrated long-term stability and did not crystallize even after storage for over 14 months in air. The stability of the ACP in water and an α-MEM cell culture medium were also examined. The stability of ACP could be tuned by adjusting its chemical composition. The ACP synthesized in this work was cytocompatible and acted as drug carriers for the bisphosphonate drug alendronate (AL) in vitro. AL-loaded ACP released ~25% of the loaded AL in the first 22 days. These properties make ACP a promising candidate material for potential application in biomedical fields such as drug delivery and bone healing.},

The influence of the rare-earth stoichiometry on structure, morphology and superconducting properties of these films was studied. The growth process was carefully studied in order to find the most appropriate growth conditions for each composition and substrate. This led to a clear improvement in film quality, probably due to the reduction of BaCeO3 formation. In general, the superconducting properties of the films on Ni5W are significantly better. For x > 0.5, epitaxial ~270 nm thick YGBCO-BHO films with Tc > 93 K and self-field Jc at 77 K ~2 MA/cm² were obtained on Ni5W. These results highlight the potential of this approach for the fabrication of high-quality coated conductors.},

ABSTRACT = {Poly(lactic acid) (PLA) is one of the most commonly employed synthetic biopolymers for facing plastic waste problems. Despite its numerous strengths, its inherent brittleness, low toughness, and thermal stability, as well as a relatively slow crystallization rate represent some limiting properties when packaging is its final intended application. In the present work, silver nanoparticles obtained from a facile and green synthesis method, mediated with chitosan as a reducing and stabilizing agent, have been introduced in the oligomeric lactic acid (OLA) plasticized PLA in order to obtain nanocomposites with enhanced properties to find potential application as antibacterial food packaging materials. In this way, the green character of the matrix and plasticizer was preserved by using an eco-friendly synthesis protocol of the nanofiller. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) results proved the modification of the crystalline structure as well as the crystallinity of the pristine matrix when chitosan mediated silver nanoparticles (AgCH-NPs) were present. The final effect over the thermal stability, mechanical properties, degradation under composting conditions, and antimicrobial behavior when AgCH-NPs were added to the neat plasticized PLA matrix was also investigated. The obtained results revealed interesting properties of the final nanocomposites to be applied as materials for the targeted application.},

ABSTRACT = {Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are direct gap semiconductors with promising applications in diverse optoelectronic devices. To improve devices’ performance, recent investigations have been systematically focused on the tuning of their optical properties. However, an all-optical approach with the reversible feature is still a challenge. Here we demonstrate the tunability of the photoluminescence (PL) properties of monolayer WS2 via laser irradiation. The broad-range and continuous modulation of PL intensity, as well as the conversion between neutral and charged excitons have been readily and reversibly achieved by only switching the two laser power densities. We attribute the reversible manipulation to the laser-assisted adsorption and desorption of gas molecules, which will deplete or release free electrons from the surface of WS2 and thus modify its PL properties. This all-optical manipulation, with advantages of reversibility, quantitative control, and high spatial resolution, suggests promising applications of TMDs monolayers in optoelectronic and nanophotonic applications, such as erasable optical data storage, micropatterning, and display.},

ABSTRACT = {Lifetime of lanthanide luminescence basically decreases with increasing the ambient temperature. In this work, we developed NaErF4 core–shell nanocrystals with compensation of the lifetime variation with temperature. Upconversion lifetime of various emissions remains substantially unchanged as increasing the ambient temperature, upon 980/1530 nm excitation. The concentrated dopants, leading to extremely strong interactions between them, are responsible for the unique temperature-independent lifetime. Besides, upconversion mechanisms of NaErF4 core-only and core–shell nanocrystals under 980 and 1530 nm excitations were comparatively investigated. On the basis of luminescent ratiometric method, we demonstrated the optical thermometry using non-thermally coupled 4F9/2 and 4I9/2 emissions upon 1530 nm excitation, favoring the temperature monitoring in vivo due to both excitation and emissions fall in the biological window. The formed NaErF4 core–shell nanocrystals with ultra-small particle size, highly efficient upconversion luminescence, unique temperature-independent lifetimes, and thermometry operated in a biological window, are versatile in applications such as anti-counterfeiting, time-domain manipulation, and biological thermal probes.},

ABSTRACT = {The nanocomposites were prepared by synthesizing (2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-yl)oxyl (TEMPO)-oxidized cellulose nanofibrils (TCNFs) or cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) with hydroxyapatite (HA) in varying composition ratios in situ. These nanocomposites were first obtained from eggshell-derived calcium and phosphate of ammonium dihydrogen orthophosphate as precursors at a stoichiometric Ca/P ratio of 1.67 with ultrasonication and compressed further by a uniaxial high-pressure technique. Different spectroscopic, microscopic, and thermogravimetric analyses were used to evaluate their structural, crystalline, and morphological properties, while their mechanical properties were assessed by an indentation method. The contents of TCNF and CNC were shown to render the formation of the HA crystallites and thus influenced strongly on the composite nanostructure and further on the mechanical properties. In this sense, the TCNF-based composites with relatively higher contents (30 and 40 wt %) of semicrystalline and flexible TCNFs resulted in smoother and more uniformly distributed HA particles with good interconnectivity, a hardness range of 550–640 MPa, a compression strength range of 110–180 MPa, an elastic modulus of ~5 GPa, and a fracture toughness value of ~6 MPa1/2 in the range of that of cortical bone. Furthermore, all the composites did not induce cytotoxicity to human bone-derived osteoblast cells but rather improved their viability, making them promising for bone tissue regeneration in load-bearing applications.},

ABSTRACT = {Exclusive and unprecedented interest was accorded in this paper to the synthesis of BiFeO3 nanopowders by the polyol process. The synthesis protocol was explored and adjusted to control the purity and the grain size of the final product. The optimum parameters were carefully established and an average crystallite size of about 40 nm was obtained. XRD and Mössbauer measurements proved the high purity of the synthesized nanostructurated powders and confirmed the persistence of the rhombohedral R3c symmetry. The first studies on the magnetic properties show a noticeable widening of the hysteresis loop despite the remaining cycloidal magnetic structure, promoting the enhancement of the ferromagnetic order and consequently the magnetoelectric coupling compared to micrometric size powders.},

ABSTRACT = {We theoretically proposed and numerically analyzed a polarization-independent, wide-angle, and ultra-broadband absorber based on a multi-layer metasurface. The numerical simulation results showed that the average absorption rates were more than 97.2% covering the broad wavelength of 400~6000 nm (from visible light to mid-infrared light) and an absorption peak was 99.99%, whatever the polarization angle was changed from 0° to 90°. Also, as the incidence angle was swept from 0° to 55°, the absorption performance had no apparent change over the wavelength ranges of 400 to 6000 nm. We proved that the proposed metasurface structure was obviously advantageous to achieve impedance matching between the absorber and the free space as compared with conventionally continuous planar-film structures. The broadband and high absorption resulted from the strong localized surface plasmon resonance and superposition of resonant frequencies. As expectable the proposed absorber structure will hold great potential in plasmonic light harvesting, photodetector applications, thermal emitters and infrared cloaking.},

ABSTRACT = {Tellurium-doped, mesoporous carbon nanomaterials with a relatively high doping level were prepared by a simple stabilization and carbonization method in the presence of a tellurium metalloid. A transparent counter electrode (CE) was prepared using tellurium-doped, mesoporous carbon (TeMC) materials, and was directly applied to bifacial, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). To improve the performance of the bifacial DSSC device, CEs should have outstanding electrocatalytic activity, electrical conductivity, and electrochemical stability, as well as high transparency. In this study, to make transparent electrodes with outstanding electrocatalytic activity and electrical conductivity, various TeMC materials with different carbonization temperatures were prepared by simple pyrolysis of the polyacrylonitrile-block-poly (n-butyl acrylate) (PAN-b-PBA) block copolymer in the presence of the tellurium metalloid. The electrocatalytic activity of the prepared TeMC materials were evaluated through a dummy cell test, and the material with the best catalytic ability was selected and optimized for application in bifacial DSSC devices by controlling the film thickness of the CE. As a result, the bifacial DSSC devices with the TeMC CE exhibited high power conversion efficiencies (PCE), i.e., 9.43% and 8.06% under front and rear side irradiation, respectively, which are the highest values reported for bifacial DSSCs to date. Based on these results, newly-developed transparent, carbon-based electrodes may lead to more stable and effective bifacial DSSC development without sacrificing the photovoltaic performance of the DSSC device.},

ABSTRACT = {Herein, to investigate the pore effect on toluene catalytic oxidation activity, novel supports for Pt nanoparticles—ZSM-5 foam (ZF) fabricated using polyurethane foam (PUF) templates and pore-modified ZSM-5 foam (ZF-D) treated by acid etching, comparing with conventional ZSM-5 and pore-modified ZSM-5 (ZSM-5-D), were successfully synthesized. Pt nanoparticles were loaded on series ZSM-5 supports by the impregnation method. The Pt loaded on ZF-D (Pt/ZF-D) showed the highest activity of toluene catalytic combustion (i.e., T90 = 158 °C), with extraordinary stability and an anti-coking ability. Based on various catalysts characterizations, the unique macropores of ZF facilitated the process of acid etching as compared to conventional ZSM-5. The mesopores volume of ZF-D significantly increased due to acid etching, which enlarged toluene adsorption capacity and led to a better Pt distribution since some Pt nanoparticles were immobilized into some mesopores. Specifically, the microporous distribution was centered in the range of 0.7–0.8 nm close to the molecular diameter of toluene (ca. 0.67 nm), which was key to the increasing toluene diffusion rate due to pore levitation effect of catalysts and accessibility of metal. Furthermore, the reducibility of Pt nanoparticles was improved on Pt/ZF-D, which enhanced the activity of toluene catalytic oxidation.},

ABSTRACT = {Sheaf-like CeO2 (CeO2-S) in microscale was prepared by the hydrothermal method, and then etched with KOH aiming to obtain an imperfect fluorite structure (CeO2-SK) with high content of oxygen vacancies and oxygen mobility. With CeO2-S and CeO2-SK as supports respectively, a modified colloidal deposition method was employed to obtain Pd/CeO2 catalysts for being used in lean methane combustion. According to the inductively coupled plasma (ICP), N2 physisorption and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) results, the Pd supported catalysts are very similar in their Pd loading, surface area and morphologies. SEM and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) results revealed various nanorods exposed CeO2 (110) and (100) facets on Pd/CeO2-SK surface after KOH etching. Raman spectra and H2-temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) results indicated that Pd/CeO2-SK catalyst has a much higher content of catalytic active PdO species than Pd/CeO2-S catalyst. It was also found that the catalytic performance of Pd/CeO2 in lean methane combustion depends greatly upon the exposing crystal planes and oxygen vacancies content of sheaf-like CeO2, and Pd/CeO2-SK exhibits higher activity than Pd/CeO2-S. The larger amount of CeO2 (110) and (100) planes on Pd/CeO2-SK surface can enhance the formation of oxygen vacancies, active Pd species and migration of lattice oxygen, which all evidently improve the redox ability and catalytic activity of the Pd/CeO2-SK catalysts in lean methane combustion.},

ABSTRACT = {Infrared (IR) shielding materials are commonly used for different applications, such as smart windows or optical filters. Infrared radiation is responsible for about 50% of the energy coming from the sun. During a hot summer or cold winter a lot of energy is needed to keep the optimal temperature inside buildings and means of transport. To reduce the heat transmission and save energy IR shielding materials can be used as coatings made of polymer composites. Graphene oxide (GO) and its reduced forms have interesting IR absorption properties and might be used as a filler in a polymer matrix for IR shielding applications. Graphene oxide can be reduced by different methods. Depending on the reduction method reduced graphene oxide (rGO) with a different content of oxygen can be obtained exhibiting different properties. In this work we propose new polymer nanocomposites with poly(vinyl alcohol) as the matrix and 0.1 wt.% addition of graphene materials with different oxygen content to be used for IR shielding applications. The results show that the properties of the graphene filler strongly influence the infrared shielding properties of the obtained nanocomposites. The best IR shielding properties were obtained for the composites where rGO with the lowest oxygen content was used.},

ABSTRACT = {It is significant to study the reason that semiconductor material has adjustable third-order optical nonlinearity through crystal form and dimensions are changed. αMnS nanoparticles with different crystal forms and sizes were successfully prepared by one-step hydrothermal synthesis method and their size-limited third-order nonlinear optical property was tested by Z-scan technique with 30 ps laser pulses at 532 nm wavelength. Nanoparticles of different crystal forms exhibited different NLO (nonlinear optical) responses. γMnS had stronger NLO response than αMnS because of higher fluorescence quantum yield. Two-photon absorption and the nonlinear refraction are enhanced as size of nanoparticlesreduced. The nanoparticles had maximum NLO susceptibility which was 3.09 × 10−12 esu. Susceptibility of αMnS increased about nine times than that of largest nanoparticles. However, it was reduced when size was further decreased. This trend was explained by the effects of light induced dipole moments. And defects in αMnS nanoparticles also had effect on this nonlinear process. MnS nanoparticles had potential application value in optical limiting and optical modulation.},

ABSTRACT = {Resveratrol (RES) is a stilbenoid polyphenol with interesting antitumor activity compromised by its poor solubility and bioavailability; thus, new approaches are necessary to improve its therapeutic effectiveness. In the present study, bovine serum albumin coated layered double hydroxide (LDH–BSA) was employed to encapsulate RES in order to overcome the above-mentioned usage limits. To evaluate the feasibility of neutral RES complexation with cationic LDH, we carried out molecular dynamics simulation in order to predict its structure and stability. In the supramolecular complex formed with LDH, RES disposes itself in the interlamellar region of LDH where it is stabilized by intermolecular interactions. The physico-chemical characteristics of the resulting nanocomplexes were studied by X-ray powder diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The encapsulation efficiency and drug release studies were also performed. The combined experimental and computational approach were highly effective in giving insight into the interaction mode of the neutral RES with the charged LDH. Finally, the nanohybrid’s anticancer ability was evaluated in human lung cancer cell line (A549) resulting in higher activity with respect to bare RES. Overall, the results showed that the nanocomposites are suitable for biomedical applications as delivery agents of RES.},

ABSTRACT = {In this study, the effects of three processing stages: filament extrusion, 3D printing (FDM), and hot-pressing are investigated on electrical conductivity and tensile mechanical properties of poly(lactic) acid (PLA) composites filled with 6 wt.% of multiwall carbon nanotubes(MWCNTs), graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs), and combined fillers. The filaments show several decades’ higher electrical conductivity and 50–150% higher values of tensile characteristics, compared to the 3D printed and the hot-pressed samples due to the preferential orientation of nanoparticles during filament extrusion. Similar tensile properties and slightly higher electrical conductivity are found for the hot-pressed compared to the 3D printed samples, due to the reduction of interparticle distances, and consequently, the reduced tunneling resistances in the percolated network by hot pressing. Three structural types are observed in nanocomposite filaments depending on the distribution and interactions of fillers, such as segregated network, homogeneous network, and aggregated structure. The type of structural organization of MWCNTs, GNPs, and combined fillers in the matrix polymer is found determinant for the electrical and tensile properties. The crystallinity of the 3D printed samples is higher compared to the filament and hot-pressed samples, but this structural feature has a slight effect on the electrical and tensile properties. The results help in understanding the influence of processing on the properties of the final products based on PLA composites.},

ABSTRACT = {Cellular association of nanoparticles (NPs) and their resultant cytotoxicity are heterogeneous in nature and can be influenced by the variances in NPs’ properties, cell types, and status. However, conventional in vitro assays typically consider the administered NP dose and the averaged cellular responses based on the assumption of a uniform distribution of monodisperse NPs in homogeneous cells, which might be insufficient to describe the complex nature of cell–NP interactions. Here, using flow cytometry, we report observations of the heterogeneity in the cellular association of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in A549 cells, which resulted in distinct dose-response relationships and cytotoxicity. Type I and Type II cells were moderately associated with AgNPs but as the cellular AgNP dose increased, Type I cells remained viable while Type II cells became less viable. Type III cells did not have high affinity with AgNPs but were, however, the least viable. Transmission electron microscopic images revealed that the biodistribution and the released Ag+ ions contributed to the distinct toxic effects of AgNPs in different populations. This single-cell dose-response analysis approach enabled the examination of how differently individual cells responded to different cellular NP doses and provided insights into nanotoxicity pathways at a single-cell level.},

ABSTRACT = {Iron powders and Fe/graphene oxide and Fe/boron nitride composites were synthesized by means of a polyol synthesis method. The effect of NaOH/Fe and ascorbic acid/Fe ratios on the characteristics of synthesized products were evaluated. The samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning and transmission electron microscopy, low-temperature nitrogen adsorption and Raman-spectroscopy. Ascorbic acid-assisted polyol synthesis resulted in the 10-fold decrease of the iron particles’ size and almost 2-fold increase of lead removal efficiency. The deposition of iron on the surface of graphene oxide lead to the formation of small 20–30 nm sized particles as well as bigger 200–300 nm sized particles, while the reduction in presence of boron nitride resulted in the 100–200 nm sized particles. The difference is attributed to the surface state of graphene oxide and boron nitride. Adsorption properties of the obtained materials were studied in the process of Pb2+ ion removal from wastewater.},

The results manifested that, at room temperature, AC phonon scattering dominated, while with the increase in temperature, the LO phonon scattering increased significantly and played a dominate role if temperature goes beyond 600 K. Due to the phonon scatterings, the resonant properties of the graphene metamaterial structure indicated an optimum value (about 0.5–0.8 eV) with the increase in Fermi level, which were different from the existing results. The results are very helpful to understand the tunable mechanisms of graphene functional devices, sensors, modulators, and antennas.},

ABSTRACT = {The various volume concentrations of ionic liquid-modified graphene nanosheets filled polytetrafluoroethylene nanocomposites (IL-GNs/PTFE) for flexible conductors were fabricated via a pre-stretch processing method after cold-press sintering. The results indicated that pre-stretching has no significant weakening in the electrical conductivity of the nanocomposites, while the Young’s modulus greatly reduced by 62.5%, which is more suitable for flexible conductors. This may be because the reduced conductivity by the destructive conductive pathway cancels out the enhanced conductivity by the increased interlamellar spacing of IL-GNs via a pre-stretch processing, and the nanocomposite exhibits a phase transition from two to three-phase (with the introduction of an air phase) during pre-stretching. It was also found that the tensile strength of the nanocomposites was enhanced by 42.9% and the elongation at break and thermal conductivity decreased slightly with the same filler content after pre-stretching. The electrical conductivity of the pre-stretched nanocomposites tended to stabilize at 5.5 × 10−2 s·m−1, when the volume content of the packings achieved a percolation threshold (1.49 vol%). Meanwhile, the electrical resistivity of the pre-stretched 3.0 vol% IL-GNs/PTFE nanocomposite was slightly reduced by 0.30%, 0.38%, and 0.87% respectively after 180° twisting, 180° bending, and 10% stretching strain for 1000 cycles.},

A 25 BL thin film (~500 nm thick), composed of a PEO/DWNT-PAA sequence, displays electrical conductivity of 19.6 S/cm and a Seebeck coefficient of 60 µV/K, which results in a power factor of 7.1 µW/m·K2. The resultant nanocomposite exhibits a crack-free surface up to 30% strain and retains its thermoelectric performance, decreasing only 10% relative to the unstretched one. Even after 1000 cycles of bending and twisting, the thermoelectric behavior of this nanocomposite is stable. The synergistic combination of the elastomeric mechanical properties (originated from PEO/PAA systems) and thermoelectric behaviors (resulting from a three-dimensional conjugated network of DWNT) opens up the possibility of achieving various applications such as wearable electronics and sensors that require high mechanical compliance.},

The results show that with the increase of temperature, the failure behavior of GNSs/FGH95 composite changes from the interface debonding of the GNSs/matrix to the failure of the FGH95 matrix. This work suggests that GNSs/FGH95 composite has great potential to be a structural material in aero-engine fields.},

ABSTRACT = {Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) based on thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters (TADF) in simple device structures fabricated by solution processing are strongly dependent on a suitable host molecular conformation and morphology. Herein, we report the fabrication of highly efficient yellow-red TADF-based OLEDs via solution processing in a simple, two-organic-layer device structure. The devices were fabricated at different weight concentrations of 5%, 8%, and 10% emitter in an n-/p-type mixed host matrix, and their characteristics were studied. The device performance was compared with different thickness parameters for both the emitting layer (EML) and the electron transport layer (ETL) in various solvents, including chlorobenzene, dichlorobenzene, and chloroform. By optimizing the mixed ratio of EML, yellow-red OLEDs of 2-[4 (diphenylamino)phenyl]-10,10-dioxide-9H-thioxanthen-9-one (TXO-TPA) emitter in an n-/p-type host matrix of poly(N-vinylcarbazole):1,3-Bis[2-(4-tert-butylphenyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazo-5-yl]benzene (PVK:OXD-7) as a blend for the active layer were fabricated. In the best results, the device exhibited a lower turn-on voltage at around 6 V, with an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 18.44%, current efficiency of 36.71 cd/A, and power efficiency of 14.74 Lm/W for the 8% emitter concentration. The importance of solvent for improving the electrical properties, together with organic layer thickness and host effect for the charge carrier’s transport and device characteristics are also discussed.},

ABSTRACT = {There is a growing interest in extending plasmonics applications into the ultraviolet region of the electromagnetic spectrum. Noble metals are commonly used in plasmonic, but their intrinsic optical properties limit their use above 350 nm. Aluminum is probably the most suitable material for UV plasmonics, and in this work we fabricated substrates of nanoporous aluminum starting from an alloy of Al2Mg3. The porous metal is obtained by means of a galvanic replacement reaction. Such nanoporous metal can be exploited to achieve a plasmonic material suitable for enhanced UV Raman spectroscopy and fluorescence. Thanks to the large surface to volume ratio, this material represents a powerful platform for promoting interaction between plasmonic substrates and molecules in the UV.},

ABSTRACT = {We present and discuss the capability of grain boundaries to induce order in block copolymer thin films between horizontally and vertically assembled block copolymer grains. The system we use as a proof of principle is a thermally annealed 23.4 nm full-pitch lamellar Polystyrene-block-polymethylmetacrylate (PS-b-PMMA) di-block copolymer. In this paper, grain-boundary-induced alignment is achieved by the mechanical removal of the neutral brush layer via atomic force microscopy (AFM). The concept is also confirmed by a mask-less e-beam direct writing process. An elongated grain of vertically aligned lamellae is trapped between two grains of horizontally aligned lamellae. This configuration leads to the formation of 90° twist grain boundaries. The features maintain their orientation on a characteristic length scale, which is described by the material’s correlation length ξ. As a result of an energy minimization process, the block copolymer domains in the vertically aligned grain orient perpendicularly to the grain boundary. The energy-minimizing feature is the grain boundary itself. The width of the manipulated area (e.g., the horizontally aligned grain) does not represent a critical process parameter.},

ABSTRACT = {2,2’-(Ethylenedioxy)bis(ethylamine)-functionalized graphene quantum dots (GQDs) were prepared under mild conditions from graphene oxide (GO) via oxidative fragmentation. The as-prepared GQDs have an average diameter of ca. 4 nm, possess good colloidal stability, and emit strong green-yellow light with a photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield of 22% upon excitation at 375 nm. We also demonstrated that the GQDs exhibit high photostability and the PL intensity is poorly affected while tuning the pH from 1 to 8. Finally, GQDs can be used to chelate Fe(II) and Cu(II) cations, scavenge radicals, and reduce Fe(III) into Fe(II). These chelating and reducing properties that associate to the low cytotoxicity of GQDs show that these nanoparticles are of high interest as antioxidants for health applications.},

The microstructure analysis was performed using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to investigate the morphology of GO. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) studies demonstrated the nanostructure and crystalline phases of GO. The antibacterial activity of the prepared GO NS was investigated against pure cultures of Pseudomonas pneumonia and Staphylococcus aureus.

We study the effects of the gate-voltage range and sweeping time on the channel current and on its hysteretic behavior. We observe that the conduction of the MoS2 channel is affected by trap states. Moreover, we report a gate-controlled field emission current from the edge part of the MoS2 flake, evidencing a field enhancement factor of approximately 200 and a turn-on field of approximately   40   V / μ m at a cathode–anode separation distance of 900   nm .},

ABSTRACT = {Nano-silver paste, as an important basic material for manufacturing thick film components, ultra-fine circuits, and transparent conductive films, has been widely used in various fields of electronics. Here, aiming at the shortcomings of the existing nano-silver paste in printing technology and the problem that the existing printing technology cannot achieve the printing of high viscosity, high solid content nano-silver paste, a nano-silver paste suitable for electric-field-driven (EFD) micro-scale 3D printing is developed. The result shows that there is no oxidation and settlement agglomeration of nano-silver paste with a storage time of over six months, which indicates that it has good dispersibility. We focus on the printing process parameters, sintering process, and electrical conductivity of nano-silver paste. The properties of the nano-silver paste were analyzed and the feasibility and practicability of the prepared nano-silver paste in EFD micro-scale 3D printing technology were verified. The experiment results indicate that the printed silver mesh which can act as transparent electrodes shows high conductivity (1.48 Ω/sq) and excellent transmittance (82.88%). The practical viability of the prepared nano-silver paste is successfully demonstrated with a deicing test. Additionally, the experimental results show that the prepared silver mesh has excellent heating properties, which can be used as transparent heaters.},

ABSTRACT = {An immobilization protocol of a model enzyme into silica nanoparticles was applied. This protocol exploited the use of the bifunctional molecule triethoxysilylpropylisocyanate (TEPI) for covalent binding through a linker of suitable length. The enzyme β-glucosidase (BG) was anchored onto wrinkled silica nanoparticles (WSNs). BG represents a bottleneck in the conversion of lignocellulosic biomass into biofuels through cellulose hydrolysis and fermentation. The key aspect of the procedure was the use of an organic solvent (anhydrous acetone) in which the enzyme was not soluble. This aimed to restrict its conformational changes and thus preserve its native structure. This approach led to a biocatalyst with improved thermal stability, characterized by high immobilization efficiency and yield. It was found that the apparent KM value was about half of that of the free enzyme. The Vmax was about the same than that of the free enzyme. The biocatalyst showed a high operational stability, losing only 30% of its activity after seven reuses.},

By investigating contamination induced by surface adatoms during a loading process, a direct physical image of the contamination process and the relationship between the capacitance change and the contamination from surface adatoms is examined theoretically and experimentally. From the relationship, the contamination by surface adatoms and the effect of in situ treatment process can be monitored by the capacitance between electrodes in real time. This study is foundational to further research on anomalous heating with practical applications in quantum information processing from surface ion traps.},

ABSTRACT = {The increased use of nanoparticles (NPs) requires efficient testing of their potential toxic effects. A promising approach is to use reporter cell lines to quickly assess the activation of cellular stress response pathways. This study aimed to use the ToxTracker reporter cell lines to investigate (geno)toxicity of various metal- or metal oxide NPs and draw general conclusions on NP-induced effects, in combination with our previous findings. The NPs tested in this study (n = 18) also included quantum dots (QDs) in different sizes. The results showed a large variation in cytotoxicity of the NPs tested. Furthermore, whereas many induced oxidative stress only few activated reporters related to DNA damage. NPs of manganese (Mn and Mn3O4) induced the most remarkable ToxTracker response with activation of reporters for oxidative stress, DNA damage, protein unfolding and p53-related stress. The QDs (CdTe) were highly toxic showing clearly size-dependent effects and calculations suggest surface area as the most relevant dose metric. Of all NPs investigated in this and previous studies the following induce the DNA damage reporter; CuO, Co, CoO, CdTe QDs, Mn, Mn3O4, V2O5, and welding NPs. We suggest that these NPs are of particular concern when considering genotoxicity induced by metal- and metal oxide NPs.},

ABSTRACT = {Recently, with the development of personal wearable electronic devices, the demand for portable power is miniaturization and flexibility. Electro-conductive hydrogels (ECHs) are considered to have great application prospects in portable energy-storage devices. However, the synergistic properties of self-healability, viscoelasticity, and ideal electrochemistry are key problems. Herein, a novel ECH was synthesized by combining polyvinyl alcohol-borax (PVA) hydrogel matrix and 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPO)-cellulose nanofibers (TOCNFs), carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and polyaniline (PANI). Among them, CNTs provided excellent electrical conductivity; TOCNFs acted as a dispersant to help CNTs form a stable suspension; PANI enhanced electrochemical performance by forming a “core-shell” structural composite. The freeze-standing composite hydrogel with a hierarchical 3D-network structure possessed the compression stress (~152 kPa) and storage modulus (~18.2 kPa). The composite hydrogel also possessed low density (~1.2 g cm−3), high water-content (~95%), excellent flexibility, self-healing capability, electrical conductivity (15.3 S m−1), and specific capacitance of 226.8 F g−1 at 0.4 A g−1. The fabricated solid-state all-in-one supercapacitor device remained capacitance retention (~90%) after 10 cutting/healing cycles and capacitance retention (~85%) after 1000 bending cycles. The novel ECH had potential applications in advanced personalized wearable electronic devices.},

ABSTRACT = {Magnetic immobilization as a novel technique was used to immobilize recombinant Pichia pastoris (GS115 Albumin) cells to produce human serum albumin (HSA). In this regard, magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) coated with amino propyl triethoxy silane (APTES) were synthesized. P. pastoris cells were decorated with MNPs via nonspecific interactions. Decorated cells were magneto-responsible and easily harvested by applying an external magnetic field. The efficiency of magnetic immobilization (Ei) for cell removal was in direct relation with the MNP concentration and time of exposure to the magnetic field. By increasing the nanoparticles concentration, cells were harvested in a shorter period. Complete cell removal (Ei ≈ 100) was achieved in ≥0.5 mg/mL of MNPs in just 30 s. HSA is produced in an extremely high cell density (OD ~20) and it is the first time that magnetic immobilization was successfully employed for harvesting such a thick cell suspension. After 5 days of induction the cells, which were immobilized with 0.25 to 1 mg/mL of nanoparticles, showed an increased potency for recombinant HSA production. The largest increase in HSA production (38.1%) was achieved in the cells that were immobilized with 0.5 mg/mL of nanoparticles. These results can be considered as a novel approach for further developments in the P. pastoris-based system.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper evaluated the effect of graphene oxide/graphene (GO/GR) hybrid on mechanical properties of cement mortar. The underlying mechanism was also investigated. In the GO/GR hybrid, GO was expected to act as a dispersant for GR while GR was used as reinforcement in mortar due to its excellent mechanical properties. For the mortar specimen, flexural and compressive strength were measured at varied GO to GR ratios of 1:0, 3:1, 1:1, 1:3, and 0:1 by keeping the total amount of GO and GR constant. The underlying mechanism was investigated through the dispersibility of GR, heat releasing characteristics during hydration, and porosity of mortar. The results showed that GO/GR hybrid significantly enhanced the flexural and compressive strength of cement mortars. The flexural strength reached maximum at GO:GR = 1:1, where the enhancement level was up to 23.04% (28 days) when compared to mortar prepared with only GO, and up to 15.63% (7 days) when compared to mortar prepared with only GR. In terms of compressive strength, the enhancement level for GO:GR = 3:1 was up to 21.10% (3 days) when compared with that of mortar incorporating GO only. The enhancement in compressive strength with mortar at GO:GR = 1:1 was up to 14.69% (7-day) when compared with mortar incorporating GR only. In addition to dispersibility, the compressive strength was also influenced by other factors, such as the degree of hydration, porosity, and pore size distribution of mortar, which made the mortars perform best at different ages.},

ABSTRACT = {Polydopamine (PDA)—a known adhesive coating material—was used herein to strongly immobilize a Pt-particle catalyst on an acrylonitrile–butadiene–styrene copolymer (ABS) substrate. Previous studies have shown that the poor adhesion between Pt particles and ABS surfaces is a considerable problem, leading to low catalytic durability for H2O2 decomposition during contact-lens cleaning. First, the ABS substrate was coated with PDA, and the PDA film was evaluated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Second, Pt particles were immobilized on the PDA-coated ABS substrate (ABS-PDA) using the electron-beam irradiation reduction method. The Pt particles immobilized on ABS-PDA (Pt/ABS-PDA) were observed using a scanning electron microscope. The Pt-loading weight was measured by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy. Third, the catalytic activity of the Pt/ABS-PDA was evaluated as the residual H2O2 concentration after immersing it in a 35,000-ppm H2O2 solution (the target value was less than 100 ppm). The catalytic durability was evaluated as the residual H2O2 concentration after repeated use. The PDA coating drastically improved both the catalytic activity and durability because of the high Pt-loading weight and strong adhesion among Pt particles, PDA, and the ABS substrate. Plasma treatment prior to PDA coating further improved the catalytic durability.},

ABSTRACT = {The development of visible-light active photocatalysts is a current challenge especially energy and environmental-related fields. Herein, methylammonium lead iodide perovskite (MAIPb) was chosen as the novel semiconductor material for its ability of absorbing visible-light. An easily reproducible and efficient method was employed to synthesize the as-mentioned material. The sample was characterized by various techniques and has been used as visible-light photocatalyst for degradation of two model pollutants: rhodamine B (RhB) and methylene-blue (MB). The photo-degradation of RhB was found to achieve about 65% after 180 min of treatment. Moreover, the efficiency was enhanced to 100% by assisting the process with a small amount of H2O2. The visible-light activity of the photocatalyst was attributed to its ability to absorb light as well as to enhance separation of photogenerated carriers. The main outcome of the present work is the investigation of a hybrid perovskite as photocatalyst for wastewater treatment.},

ABSTRACT = {In this study, silica-coated magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (MNPs@SiO2) were covalently conjugated onto graphene oxide (GO/MNP@SiO2) for protein isolation. First, MNPs were precisely coated with a silica layer on the surface by using the reverse microemulsion method, followed by incubation with 3-glycidyloxypropyltrimethoxysilane (GPTS) to produce the GPTS-functionalized MNPs@SiO2 (GPTS-coated MNPs@SiO2) that display epoxy groups on the surface. The silica shell on the MNPs was optimized at 300 µL of Igepal®CO-520, 5 mg of MNP, 100 µL of TEOS, 100 µL of NH4OH and 3% of 3-glycidyloxypropyltrimethoxysilane (GPTS). Simultaneously, polyethyleneimine (PEI) was covalently conjugated to GO to enhance the stability of GO in aqueous solutions and create the reaction sites with epoxy groups on the surface of GPTS-coated MNP@SiO2. The ratio of PEI grafted GO and GPTS-coated MNP@SiO2 (GO/MNP ratio) was investigated to produce GO/MNPs@SiO2 with highly saturated magnetization without aggregation. As a result, the GO/MNP ratio of 5 was the best condition to produce the GO/MNP@SiO2 with 9.53 emu/g of saturation superparamagnetization at a magnetic field of 2.0 (T). Finally, the GO/MNPs@SiO2 were used to separate bovine serum albumin (BSA) to investigate its protein isolation ability. The quantity of BSA adsorbed onto 1 mg of GO/MNP@SiO2 increased sharply over time to reach 628 ± 9.3 µg/mg after 15 min, which was 3.5-fold-higher than that of GPTS-coated MNP@SiO2. This result suggests that the GO/MNP@SiO2 nanostructure can be used for protein isolation.},

ABSTRACT = {The synthesis of promising nanocomposite materials can always be tricky and depends a lot on the method of synthesis itself. Developing such synthesis routes, which are not only simple but also can effectively catch up the synergy of the compositing material, is definitely a worthy contribution towards nanomaterial science. Carbon-based materials, such as graphene oxide, and conjugative polymers, such as conductive polyaniline, are considered materials of the 21st century. This study involves a simple one pot synthesis route for obtaining a nanocomposite of polyaniline and graphene oxide with synergistic effects. The study was carried out in a systematic way by gradually changing the composition of the ingredients in the reaction bath until the formation of nanocomposite took place at some particular reaction parameters. These nanocomposites were then utilized for the fabrication of electrodes for aqueous symmetric supercapacitor devices utilizing gold or copper as current collectors. The device manifested a good capacitance value of 264 F/g at 1 A/g, magnificent rate performance, and capacitance retention of 84.09% at a high current density (10 A/g) when gold sheet electrodes were used as the current collectors. It also showed a capacitance retention of 79.83% and columbic efficiency of 99.83% after 2000 cycles.},

ABSTRACT = {Nowadays, there is a large amount of research aimed at improving the multifunctional behavior of the biomaterials for bone contact, including the concomitant ability to induce apatite formation (bioactivity), fast and effective osteoblasts colonization, and antibacterial activity. The aim of this study is to develop antibacterial and bioactive surfaces (Ti6Al4V alloy and a silica-based bioactive glass) by chemical doping with strontium and/or silver ions. The surfaces were characterized by Scanning Electron Microscopy equipped with Energy Dispersive X ray Spectroscopy (SEM-EDS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). To better focus on the cells–bacteria competition for the implant surface, in addition to the standard assays for the evaluation of the bacteria adhesion (ISO22196) and for single-cell cultures or biofilm formation, an innovative set of co-cultures of cells and bacteria is here proposed to simulate a competitive surface colonization. The results suggest that all the bioactive tested materials were cytocompatible toward the bone progenitor cells representative for the self-healing process, and that the doped ones were effective in reducing the surface colonization from a pathogenic drug-resistant strain of Staphylococcus aureus. The co-cultures experiments demonstrated that the doped surfaces were able to protect the adhered osteoblasts from the bacteria colonization as well as prevent the infection prior to the surface colonization by the osteoblasts.},

ABSTRACT = {Nonlinear plasmonic effects in perspective 2D materials containing low-dimensional quantum emitters can be a basis of a novel technological platform for the fabrication of fast all-plasmonic triggers, transistors, and sensors. This article considers the conditions for achieving a strong coupling between the surface plasmon–polariton (SPP) and quantum emitter taking into account the modification of local density of optical states in graphene waveguide. In the condition of strong coupling, nonlinear interaction between two SPP modes propagating along the graphene waveguide integrated with a stub nanoresonator loaded with core–shell semiconductor nanowires (NWs) was investigated. Using the 2D full-wave electromagnetic simulation, we studied the different transmittance regimes of the stub with NW for both the strong pump SPP and weak signal SPP tuned to interband and intraband transition in NW, respectively. We solved the practical problem of parameters optimization of graphene waveguide and semiconductor nanostructures and found such a regime of NW–SPP interaction that corresponds to the destructive interference with the signal SPP transmittance through the stub less than 7 % in the case for pump SPP to be turned off. In contrast, the turning on the pump SPP leads to a transition to constructive interference in the stub and enhancement of signal SPP transmittance to 93 % . In our model, the effect of plasmonic switching occurs with a rate of 50 GHz at wavelength 8 µ m for signal SPP localized inside 20 nm graphene stub loaded with core–shell InAs/ZnS NW.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, an electrochemical method for the measurement of tryptophan (Trp) was developed based on a glassy carbon electrode modified with polyvinylpyrrolidonefunctionalized graphene (PVP-GR)/glassy carbon electrode (GCE). In 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution (PBS, pH = 2.2), compared with bare GCE, PVP/GCE, and GR/GCE, the oxidation peak current of Trp increased dramatically at PVP-GR/GCE. The oxidation mechanism of Trp on the PVP-GR/GCE was discussed and the experimental conditions were optimized. Under the best experimental conditions, the oxidation peak current of Trp was proportional to its concentration in the range of 0.06 µM–10.0 µM and 10.0–100.0 µM, and the limit of detection (LOD) was 0.01 µM (S/N = 3). The target modified electrode with excellent repeatability, stability and selectivity, was successfully applied to detectTrp in drugs and biological samples.},

ABSTRACT = {The mechanical and thermal properties of graphene kirigami are strongly dependent on the tailoring structures. Here, thermal conductivity of three typical graphene kirigami structures, including square kirigami graphene, reentrant hexagonal honeycomb structure, and quadrilateral star structure under uniaxial strain are explored using molecular dynamics simulations. We find that the structural deformation of graphene kirigami is sensitive to its tailoring geometry. It influences thermal conductivity of graphene by changing heat flux scattering, heat path, and cross-section area. It is found that the factor of cross-section area can lead to four times difference of thermal conductivity in the large deformation system. Our results are elucidated based on analysis of micro-heat flux, geometry deformation, and atomic lattice deformation. These insights enable us to design of more efficient thermal management devices with elaborated graphene kirigami materials.},

ABSTRACT = {In this study, a series of TiO2 nanotubes (NTs) were synthesized employing electrochemical anodization of titanium foil in an ionic liquid solution containing a mixture of glycerol and choline chloride, acting as electrolyte. The as-synthesized TiO2 NTs were calcined at 350, 450, or 550 °C for a 2 h duration to investigate the influence of calcination temperature on NTs formation, morphology, surface properties, crystallinity, and subsequent photocatalytic activity for visible light photodegradation of gaseous formaldehyde (HCHO). Results showed that the calcination temperature has a significant effect on the structure and coverage of TiO2 NTs on the surface. Freshly synthesized TiO2 NTs showed better-ordered structure compared to calcined samples. There was significant pore rupture with increasing calcination temperature. The transformation from anatase to rutile phase appeared after calcination at 450 °C and the weight fraction of the rutile phase increased from 19% to 36% upon increasing the calcination temperature to 550 °C. The band gaps of the TiO2 NTs were in the range from 2.80 to 2.74 eV, shifting the active region of the materials to visible light. The presence of mixed anatase–rutile TiO2 phases in the sample calcined at 450 °C showed enhanced photoactivity, which was confirmed by the 21.56 mg∙L−1∙g−1 removal of gaseous formaldehyde under 120 min of visible light irradiation and displayed enhanced quantum yield, ∅HCHO of 17%.},

The films were deposited by spin coating of sol-gel precursor solutions and thermally treated at 600 °C for 2 h, in air and slow cooled. The doping ions concentration was 1.0 mol%. The study’s aim was to obtain implantable metallic materials with improved biocompatibility and antibacterial qualities. The characteristics of the thin films were assessed from the point of view of microstructure, morphology, wetting properties, antibacterial activity and biological response in the presence of amniotic fluid stem cells (AFSC). The results proved that all deposited samples were nanostructured, suggesting a very good antibacterial effect and proving to be suitable supports for cellular adhesion and proliferation. All properties also depended on the doping ion nature.},

ABSTRACT = {The paper presents a statistical study of nanoindentation results obtained in seven European laboratories that have joined a round robin exercise to assess methods for the evaluation of indentation size effects. The study focuses on the characterization of ferritic/martensitic steels T91 and Eurofer97, envisaged as structural materials for nuclear fission and fusion applications, respectively. Depth-controlled single cycle measurements at various final indentation depths, force-controlled single cycle and force-controlled progressive multi-cycle measurements using Berkovich indenters at room temperature have been combined to calculate the indentation hardness and the elastic modulus as a function of depth applying the Oliver and Pharr method. Intra- and inter-laboratory variabilities have been evaluated. Elastic modulus corrections have been applied to the hardness data to compensate for materials related systematic errors, like pile-up behaviour, which is not accounted for by the Oliver and Pharr theory, and other sources of instrumental or methodological bias. The correction modifies the statistical hardness profiles and allows determining more reliable indentation size effects.},

ABSTRACT = {The development of adsorbents with high adsorption capacity and fast separation is of utmost importance for the environmental management of dye-bearing wastewaters. Within this scope, crosslinked hydrogels including poly(vinylphosphonic acid) (PVPA) and bis[2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl] phosphate (BMEP) were designed with varying mole ratios of BMEP (5–40%). The Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) results revealed that the fabrication of crosslinked PVPA-BMEP hydrogels enhanced: (i) functionalities of PA groups in the structure of hydrogels, (ii) thermal stabilities up to 250 °C, and (iii) interaction between methylene blue (MB) molecules and hydrogels. The pseudo second-order kinetic model best described the experimental adsorption data. The behaviors of the isotherms were more appropriate for Langmuir than Freundlich isotherm for the experimental data. PVPA-BMEP (40%) hydrogel indicated a fast and an outstanding MB adsorption capacity of 2841 mg g−1, which has not been reported yet for polymer hydrogels, to the best of our knowledge. The thermodynamic studies concluded that MB adsorption process was spontaneous and exothermic in nature. The overall results suggest that the designed and fabricated PVPA-BMEP hydrogels have great potential for the efficient removal of coloring materials from wastewaters.},

ABSTRACT = {Magneto-plasmonic nanoparticles constituted of gold and iron oxide were obtained in an aqueous environment by laser ablation of iron and gold targets in two successive steps. Gold nanoparticles are embedded in a mucilaginous matrix of iron oxide, which was identified as magnetite by both microscopic and spectroscopic analyses. The plasmonic properties of the obtained colloids, as well as their adsorption capability, were tested by surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectroscopy using 2,2′-bipyridine as a probe molecule. DFT calculations allowed for obtaining information on the adsorption of the ligand molecules that strongly interact with positively charged surface active sites of the gold nanoparticles, thus providing efficient SERS enhancement. The presence of iron oxide gives the bimetallic colloid new possibilities of adsorption in addition to those inherent to gold nanoparticles, especially regarding organic pollutants and heavy metals, allowing to remove them from the aqueous environment by applying a magnetic field. Moreover, these nanoparticles, thanks to their low toxicity, are potentially useful not only in the field of sensors, but also for biomedical applications.},

ABSTRACT = {Biomedical applications of nanoparticles (NPs) have reached an increasing development in recent years. Recently, we demonstrated that newly synthesized poly (ethyl 2-cyanoacrylate) nanoparticles (PECA-NPs) are possible antitumor agents due to their cytotoxicity for cancer cells. Indocyanine green (ICG), an amphiphilic tricarbocyanine fluorescent dye, is widely used for the detection of tumoral extension in different organs during clinical surgery. Moreover, this fluorescent agent is unstable and it has a rapid clearance in physiological conditions in vivo. In this study, ICG was charged in PECA-NPs to improve its aqueous stability and make easier its use for the identification of tumor cells. Microscopic and ultrastructural aspects concerning the related in vitro interactions between ICG-loaded NPs and tumor cell culture were investigated. Obtained results showed an effective stabilization of ICG; furthermore, color inclusions inside the cells treated with ICG-loaded NPs demonstrated the internalization of NPs with associated ICG. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis demonstrated the cytoplasmic presence of coated vesicles (Ø ≤ 100 nm), hypothesizing their involvement in the mechanism of endocytosis. Therefore, ICG-loaded NPs could be proposed as agents for tumor diagnosis, hypothesizing also in the future a specific therapeutic treatment.},

ABSTRACT = {Black phosphorus quantum dots (BPQDs) have recently obtained great attention due to their high mobility and tunable bandgap features, which are beneficial for their potential application in photoelectronic devices. However, a precise synthesis of high-quality BPQDs is still a great challenge owing to the formation of an impurity phase when employing traditional methods. Herein, we demonstrate the scalable fabrication of BPQDs from mineralization-derived bulk black phosphorus (BP) single crystals by means of a microwave (MW)-assisted liquid-phase exfoliation method in ethanol. The primary results demonstrate that ethanol plays a crucial role in determining the final properties of BPQDs, such as their excellent tolerance to oxygen, good crystallinity, and uniform size. Furthermore, the mechanism behind the formation of BPQDs is proposed, revealing that a layer-by-layer disintegration process of bulk BP crystals under microwave-energy stimuli is responsible. This work may provide a novel path for the further development of BPQDs and corresponding devices.},

ABSTRACT = {Block copolymer (BCP) self-assembly is a promising tool for next generation lithography as microphase separated polymer domains in thin films can act as templates for surface nanopatterning with sub-20 nm features. The replicated patterns can, however, only be as precise as their templates. Thus, the investigation of the morphology of polymer domains is of great importance. Commonly used analytical techniques (neutron scattering, scanning force microscopy) either lack spatial information or nanoscale resolution. Using advanced analytical (scanning) transmission electron microscopy ((S)TEM), we provide real space information on polymer domain morphology and interfaces between polystyrene (PS) and polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) in cylinder- and lamellae-forming BCPs at highest resolution. This allows us to correlate the internal structure of polymer domains with line edge roughnesses, interface widths and domain sizes. STEM is employed for high-resolution imaging, electron energy loss spectroscopy and energy filtered TEM (EFTEM) spectroscopic imaging for material identification and EFTEM thickness mapping for visualisation of material densities at defects. The volume fraction of non-phase separated polymer species can be analysed by EFTEM. These methods give new insights into the morphology of polymer domains the exact knowledge of which will allow to improve pattern quality for nanolithography.},

ABSTRACT = {Hitherto, most research has primarily focused on improving the UV sensor efficiency via surface treatments and by stimulating the ZnO nanorod (ZNR) surface Schottky barriers. However, to the best of our knowledge, no study has yet probed the intrinsic crystal defect generation and its effects on UV sensor efficiency. In this study, we undertake this task by fabricating an intrinsic defect-prone hydrothermally grown ZNRs (S1), Ga-doped ZNRs (S2), and defect-free microwave-assisted grown ZNRs (S3). The defect states were recognized by studying X-ray diffraction and photoluminescence characteristics. The large number of crystal defects in S1 and S2 had two pronged disadvantages. (1) Most of the UV light was absorbed by the defect traps and the e–h pair generation was compromised. (2) Mobility was directly affected by the carrier–carrier scattering and phonon scattering processes. Hence, the overall UV sensor efficiency was compromised based on the defect-induced mobility-response model. Considering the facts, defect-free S3 exhibited the best UV sensor performance with the highest on/off ratio, the least impulse response time, the highest recombination time, and highest gain-induced responsivity to 368 nm UV light, which was desired of an efficient passive metal oxide-based UV sensor. Our results were compared with the recently published results.},

ABSTRACT = {Carbon nanoparticles have consistently been of great interest in medicine. However, there are currently no clinical materials based on carbon nanoparticles, due to inconsistent biodistribution and excretion data. In this work, we have synthesized a novel C60 derivative with a metal chelating agent (1,4,7-Triazacyclononane-1,4,7-triacetic acid; NOTA) covalently bound to the C60 cage and radiolabeled with copper-64 (t1/2 = 12.7 h). Biodistribution of the material was assessed in vivo using positron emission tomography (PET). Bingel-Hirsch chemistry was employed to functionalize the fullerene cage with highly water-soluble serinolamide groups allowing this new C60 conjugate to clear quickly from mice almost exclusively through the kidneys. Comparing the present results to the larger context of reports of biocompatible fullerene derivatives, this work offers an important evaluation of the in vivo biodistribution, using experimental evidence to establish functionalization guidelines for future C60-based biomedical platforms.},

ABSTRACT = {1,1-diamino-2,2-dinitroethene (FOX-7) an insensitive high-energetic compound, has rarely been reported previously with respect to combustion performance. In order to quickly apply it to propellants, the thermal decomposition behaviors of FOX-7 should be optimized. Metal complexes of nano-graphene oxide have an obvious effect on the thermal decomposition of energy materials. In this paper, the metal (Cu2+ and Fe3+) complexes of nano-graphene oxide (nGO) have been synthesized using nGO as a ligand and metal ions as a coordination center. They were mixed with FOX-7 as additives to form energetic composites, and the chemical bond distributions and thermal decomposition processes of these composites have been investigated. The results show that Cu2+ and Fe3+ are uniformly distributed on the surface of the nGO. The thermal decomposition processes of nGO-metal-FOX-7 composites have been fully characterized by Differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) and Thermal gravimetric analyzer-Differential scanning calorimeter-Infrared spectroscopy-Mass spectrum (TG-DSC-IR-MS) coupling technology. The results show that the Fe3+ based complex affect the decomposition of FOX-7 than the Cu2+ based one with the initial decomposition temperature of 230 °C and the apparent heat release of 3535.6 J·g−1. Moreover, the addition of nGO-metal complexes could promote the formation of nitrogen during the decomposition of FOX-7, indicating a more complete decomposition.},

ABSTRACT = {Transition metal carbide nanoparticles are a class of technological interesting materials with a wide range of applications. Among metal carbides, tantalum carbides have good compatibility with the biological environment while molybdenum carbides are used as catalyst in electrochemical reactions. Laser ablation of bulk transition metal targets in some liquids is here reported and laser ablation in organic solvents is used as simple synthetic strategy for the production of carbide nanostructures. Herein, the nanoparticles produced by ultra-short laser ablation of tantalum and molybdenum in water, acetone, ethanol and toluene have been characterized by TEM, XRD and XPS analysis. The combined effect of metal and solvent chemical and physical properties on the composition of the nanomaterials obtained has been pointed out. In particular, the different reactivity of Ta and Mo with respect to oxidizing species determines the composition of particles obtained in water, on the other hand the organic solvents decomposition allows to obtain transition metal carbide (TMC) nanoparticles. The observed carbonaceous shell formed on TMC allows to protect the particle’s carbidic core and to improve and tailor the applications of these nanomaterials.},

ABSTRACT = {Laser-induced periodic surface structures (LIPSS) are often present when processing solid targets with linearly polarized ultrashort laser pulses. The different irradiation parameters to produce them on metals, semiconductors and dielectrics have been studied extensively, identifying suitable regimes to tailor its properties for applications in the fields of optics, medicine, fluidics and tribology, to name a few. One important parameter widely present when exposing the samples to the high intensities provided by these laser pulses in air environment, that generally is not considered, is the formation of a superficial laser-induced oxide layer. In this paper, we fabricate LIPSS on a layer of the oxidation prone hard-coating material chromium nitride in order to investigate the impact of the laser-induced oxide layer on its formation. A variety of complementary surface analytic techniques were employed, revealing morphological, chemical and structural characteristics of well-known high-spatial frequency LIPSS (HSFL) together with a new type of low-spatial frequency LIPSS (LSFL) with an anomalous orientation parallel to the laser polarization. Based on this input, we performed finite-difference time-domain calculations considering a layered system resembling the geometry of the HSFL along with the presence of a laser-induced oxide layer. The simulations support a scenario that the new type of LSFL is formed at the interface between the laser-induced oxide layer and the non-altered material underneath. These findings suggest that LSFL structures parallel to the polarization can be easily induced in materials that are prone to oxidation.},

ABSTRACT = {Uniform Nd3+-doped LuVO4 nanophosphors have been synthesized for the first time in literature by using a poliol-based method at 120 °C from Nd3+ and vanadate precursors. After optimizing the Nd doping level, these phosphors present intense luminescence in the near-infrared biological windows. The X-ray attenuation capacity of the optimum nanophosphor has been found to be higher than that of a commercial X-ray computed tomography contrast agent. After surface coating with polyacrylic acid, such nanoparticles present high colloidal stability in physiological pH medium and high cell viability. Because of these properties, the developed Nd3+-doped LuVO4 nanoparticles have potential applications as a bimodal probe for NIR luminescent bioimaging and X-ray computed tomography.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper we studied the combination of advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), i.e., TiO2-based photocatalysis and photo-Fenton process, on the degradation of aqueous solutions containing a low (90 ppm) concentration of formaldehyde. Heterogeneous nanostructured catalysts, supported on polymeric nanofibers, were used; for comparison, some homogeneous or partly heterogeneous systems were also analyzed. Furthermore, to make the process more sustainable (in terms of costs and safety) no hydrogen peroxide was added to the system. The results showed that the combination of AOPs gave a synergy since the presence of iron was beneficial in promoting the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 while TiO2 was beneficial in promoting the photo-Fenton reaction. Moreover, very good results were obtained using fully heterogeneous nanostructured catalysts (based on TiO2 and FeSO4), without the need to add H2O2.},

ABSTRACT = {The efficiency of Au/TiO2 based catalysts in 1-phenylethanol oxidation was investigated. The role of support modifiers (La2O3 or CeO2), influence of gold loading (0.5% or 4%) and redox pretreatment atmosphere, catalyst recyclability, effect of oxidant: tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) or O2, as well as the optimization of experimental parameters of the reaction conditions in the oxidation of this alcohol were studied and compared with previous studies on 1-octanol oxidation. Samples were characterized by temperature-programmed oxygen desorption (O2-TPD) method. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were carried out for used catalysts to find out the reason for deactivation in 1-phenylethanol oxidation. The best catalytic characteristics were shown by catalysts modified with La2O3, regardless of the alcohol and the type of oxidant. When O2 was used, the catalysts with 0.5% Au, after oxidative pretreatment, showed the highest activity in both reactions. The most active catalysts in 1-phenylethanol oxidation with TBHP were those with 4% Au and the H2 treatment, while under the same reaction conditions, 0.5% Au and O2 treatment were beneficial in 1-octanol oxidation. Despite the different chemical nature of the substrates, it seems likely that Au+(Auδ+) act as the active sites in both oxidative reactions. Density functional theory (DFT) simulations confirmed that the gold cationic sites play an essential role in 1-phenylethanol adsorption.},

ABSTRACT = {The production of single dimensional carbon structures has recently been made easier using carbon nanotubes. We consider here encapsulated coronene molecules, which are flat and circular-shaped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, inside carbon nanotubes. Depending on the radius of the nanotube, certain specific configurations of the coronene molecules can be achieved that give rise to the formation of stacked columns or aid in forming nanoribbons. Due to their symmetrical structure, a coronene molecule may be modelled by three inner circular rings of carbon atoms and one outer circular ring of hydrogen atoms, while the carbon nanotube is modelled as a circular tube. Using the continuous model and the Lennard-Jones potential, we are able to analytically formulate an expression for the potential energy for a coronene dimer and coronene inside a carbon nanotube. Subsequently, stacking of coronene molecules inside a nanotube is investigated. We find that the minimum energy tilt angle of coronenes in a stack differs from that of a single coronene within the same nanotube. More specifically, for both (18, 0) and (19, 0) zigzag carbon nanotube, we find that the minimum energy tilt angles of the single coronene case (≈42 ° and ≈20 ° respectively) do not occur in the stack model.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper aims to investigate the synthesis, structure, and optical properties of SiO2@YAG:Ce core–shell optical nanoparticles for solid state lighting applications. YAG:Ce phosphor is a key part in white light emitting diodes (LEDs), with its main functionality being the generation of yellow light. Generated yellow light from phosphor will be combined with blue light, emitted from chip, resulting in the generation of white light. Generated light in LEDs will often be scattered by SiO2 nanoparticles. SiO2 nanoparticles are often distributed within the optical window, aiming for a more homogeneous light output. The main idea in this research is to combine these functionalities in one core–shell particle, with its core being SiO2 and its shell being phosphor. In this study core–shell nanoparticles with different Ce3+ concentrations were synthesized by a sol–gel method. Synthesized nanoparticles were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) analysis, high resolution transmission electron macroscopy (HRTEM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), and photoluminescence spectroscopy. Luminescence characteristics of SiO2@YAG:Ce core–shell particles were compared with that of SiO2/YAG:Ce mixture composite, which is now used in commercial LEDs. Obtained results showed that core–shell nanoparticles have comparatively much better optical properties, compared to SiO2/YAG:Ce mixture composite and can therefore be potentially used in LEDs.},

ABSTRACT = {The minimization principle of the second moment of the mass distribution ( M 2 ) is responsible for the unique structure of three-dimensional clusters by using emulsion droplet evaporation. Herein we study the structure of two-dimensional clusters of colloidal particles bound at the interface of liquid droplets in the plane. We found that, differently from the three-dimensional system, the two-dimensional clusters have multiple degenerate configurations (isomers). An interesting feature of such two-dimensional clusters is that they have the same packings as those belonging to a class of geometric figures known as polyiamonds. In particular, except for the six-particle cluster, many higher order clusters of polyiamond have not been reported previously. Using a simple geometrical approach, based on the number of ways to generate a packing, we calculated the occupation probabilities of distinct isomeric clusters. The level of agreement with the results of metropolis Monte Carlo simulations was good for clusters containing up to nine particles, suggesting that our two-dimensional cluster structures are not a result of the minimization of the second moment. In addition, the structure of these clusters is somewhat insensitive to the range and depth of the interparticle potential, in good agreement with the results in the literature.},

ABSTRACT = {The charge carrier behavior and dielectric properties of BaF2:Tb3+ nanocrystals have been studied by alternating current (AC) impedance spectroscopy. The electron and ion coexist in the transport process. The F− ion’s contribution to the total conduction increases with the doping concentration up to 4% and then decreases. Tb doping leads to the increase of defect quantities and a variation of charge carrier transport paths, which causes the increase of the ion diffusion coefficient and the decreases of bulk and grain boundary resistance. When the Tb-doped concentration is higher than 4%, the effect of deformation potential scattering variation on the transport property is dominant, which results in the decrease of the ion diffusion coefficient and increases of bulk and grain boundary resistance. The conduction properties of our BaF2:Tb3+ nanocrystals are compared with previous results that were found for the single crystals of rare earth-doped BaF2. Tb doping causes increases of both the quantity and the probability of carrier hopping, and it finally leads to increases of BaF2 nanocrystals’ permittivity in the low frequency region.},

ABSTRACT = {Improving the adhesion properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) at the molecular scale can significantly enhance dispersion of CNT fibers in polymer matrix and unleash the dormant extraordinary mechanical properties of CNTs in CNT-polymer nanocomposites. Inspired by the outstanding adhesion, dispersion, mechanical, and surface functionalization properties of crystalline nanocellulose (CNC), this paper studies the mechanical and adhesion properties of CNT wrapped by aligned cellulose chains around CNT using molecular dynamic simulations. The strength, elastic modulus, and toughness of CNT-cellulose fiber for different cellulose contents are obtained from tensile and compression tests. Additionally, the effect of adding cellulose on the surface energy, interfacial shear modulus, and strength is evaluated. The result shows that even adding a single layer cellulose wrap (≈55% content) significantly decreases the mechanical properties, however, it also dramatically enhances the adhesion energy, interfacial shear strength, and modulus. Adding more cellulose layers, subsequently, deceases and increases mechanical properties and adhesion properties, respectively. In addition, analysis of nanopapers of pristine CNT, pristine CNC, and CNT-wrapped cellulose reveals that CNT-wrapped cellulose nanopapers are strong, stiff, and tough, while for CNT and CNC either strength or toughness is compromised. This research shows that cellulose wraps provide CNT fibers with tunable mechanical properties and adhesion energy that could yield strong and tough materials due to the excellent mechanical properties of CNT and active surface and hydrogen bonding of cellulose.},

ABSTRACT = {Composite polymer electrolytes provide an emerging solution for new battery development by replacing liquid electrolytes, which are commonly complexes of polyethylene oxide (PEO) with ceramic fillers. However, the agglomeration of fillers and weak interaction restrict their conductivities. By contrast with the prevailing methods of blending preformed ceramic fillers within the polymer matrix, here we proposed an in situ synthesis method of SiO2 nanoparticles in the PEO matrix. In this case, robust chemical interactions between SiO2 nanoparticles, lithium salt and PEO chains were induced by the in situ non-hydrolytic sol gel process. The in situ synthesized nanocomposite polymer electrolyte delivered an impressive ionic conductivity of ~1.1 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 30 °C, which is two orders of magnitude higher than that of the preformed synthesized composite polymer electrolyte. In addition, an extended electrochemical window of up to 5 V vs. Li/Li+ was achieved. The Li/nanocomposite polymer electrolyte/Li symmetric cell demonstrated a stable long-term cycling performance of over 700 h at 0.01–0.1 mA cm−2 without short circuiting. The all-solid-state battery consisting of the nanocomposite polymer electrolyte, Li metal and LiFePO4 provides a discharge capacity of 123.5 mAh g−1, a Coulombic efficiency above 99% and a good capacity retention of 70% after 100 cycles.},

ABSTRACT = {Radiosensitizing agents are capable of augmenting the damage of ionizing radiation preferentially on cancer cells, thereby increasing the potency and the specificity of radiotherapy. Metal-based nanoparticles have recently gathered ground in radio-enhancement applications, owing to their exceptional competence in amplifying the cell-killing effects of irradiation. Our aim was to examine the radiosensitizing performance of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and the chromatin-modifying histone deacetylase inhibitor suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) alone and in combination. We observed that the colony-forming capability of cancer cells decreased significantly and the DNA damage, detected by γH2AX immunostaining, was substantially greater after combinational treatments than upon individual drug exposures followed by irradiation. Synergistic radiosensitizing effects of AuNPs and SAHA were proven on various cell lines, including radioresistant A549 and DU-145 cancer cells. 3D cultures often manifest radio- and drug-resistance, nevertheless, AuNPs in combination with SAHA could effectively enhance the potency of irradiation as the number of viable cells decreased significantly when spheroids received AuNP + SAHA prior to radiotherapy. Our results imply that a relaxed chromatin structure induced by SAHA renders the DNA of cancerous cells more susceptible to the damaging effects of irradiation-triggered, AuNP-released reactive electrons. This feature of AuNPs should be exploited in multimodal treatment approaches.},

Our ab initio calculations demonstrate the possibility to tune magnetic properties of Fe nanowires formed on vicinal Cu surfaces. Both intrawire and interwire magnetic exchange parameters are extracted from density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This study suggests that the effective interwire magnetic exchange parameters exhibit Ruderman–Kittel–Kasuya–Yosida-like (RKKY) oscillations as a function of Fe interwire separation. The choice of the vicinal Cu surface offers possibilities for controlling the magnetic coupling. Furthermore, an anisotropic Heisenberg model was used in Monte Carlo simulations to examine the stability of these magnetic configurations at finite temperatures. The predicted critical temperatures of the Fe nanowires on Cu(422) and Cu(533) surfaces are well above room temperature.},

ABSTRACT = {Nb2O5/graphene nanocomposites without any surfactant are synthesized by an in situ microwave irradiation technique. Structural and morphological studies revealed that the prepared composites were composed of Nb2O5 nanoparticles intercalated into the graphene sheet. The thermal stability of graphene oxide, Nb2O5, and Nb2O5/graphene nanocomposite was studied by the TGA. The electrochemical properties are assessed by cyclic voltammetry, chronopotentiometry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analyses. The specific capacitance of Nb2O5/graphene nanocomposites is greater (633 Fg−1) than pure Nb2O5 nanoparticles (221 Fg−1) and graphene (290 Fg−1) at a current density of 1 Ag−1. The long-term cyclic measurement confirms higher cyclic stability of the nanocomposite with capacitance retention of 99.3% after 5000 cycles without performance degradation. The composites exhibit higher electrochemical conductivity and allow effective ions and charge transport over the entire electrode surface with aqueous electrolyte. The electrochemical study suggests that Nb2O5/graphene nanocomposites have the potential to be an effective electrode for superior performance supercapacitor applications.},

ABSTRACT = {In this study, we describe poly (lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA)-based nanoparticles that combine photothermal therapy (PTT) with epigenetic therapy for melanoma. Specifically, we co-encapsulated indocyanine green (ICG), a PTT agent, and Nexturastat A (NextA), an epigenetic drug within PLGA nanoparticles (ICG-NextA-PLGA; INAPs). We hypothesized that combining PTT with epigenetic therapy elicits favorable cytotoxic and immunomodulatory responses that result in improved survival in melanoma-bearing mice. We utilized a nanoemulsion synthesis scheme to co-encapsulate ICG and NextA within stable and monodispersed INAPs. The INAPs exhibited concentration-dependent and near-infrared (NIR) laser power-dependent photothermal heating characteristics, and functioned as effective single-use agents for PTT of melanoma cells in vitro. The INAPs functioned as effective epigenetic therapy agents by inhibiting the expression of pan-histone deacetylase (HDAC) and HDAC6-specific activity in melanoma cells in vitro. When used for both PTT and epigenetic therapy in vitro, the INAPs increased the expression of co-stimulatory molecules and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) Class I in melanoma cells relative to controls. These advantages persisted in vivo in a syngeneic murine model of melanoma, where the combination therapy slowed tumor progression and improved median survival. These findings demonstrate the potential of INAPs as agents of PTT and epigenetic therapy for melanoma.},

The results show that Ti3C2Tx MXene possesses nanosheet structure. Ti3C2Tx MXene nanosheets were homogeneously dispersed in epoxy resin. Electrical conductivity and mechanical properties measurements reveal that the epoxy/Ti3C2Tx MXene nanosheet composite exhibited both good electrical conductivity (4.52 × 10−4 S/m) and favorable mechanical properties (tensile strength of 66.2 MPa and impact strength of 24.2 kJ/m2) when the content of Ti3C2Tx MXene nanosheets is 1.2 wt %.

Additionally, the surface charge of the materials was investigated using zeta potential at pH ~7. The results show an influence of the surface charge on the chemical, interaction, and structure of the resulting hybrid materials as a function of the starting layered structures. An expansion of the basal spacing to 10.20 Å for zinc hydroxide nitrate (ZHN), and a shrinkage to 10.37 Å for zinc hydroxide acetate (ZHA). These results suggest that the CA lies with a tilt angle in the interlayer region of the inorganic host matrix. The immobilization of CA is favored in ZHN, with respect to ZHA, because a single-layered phase was identified. A higher thermal stability at 65 °C was observed for ZHN-CA than for ZHA-CA. The evaluation of the release behavior showed a higher percentage of CA released from ZHN than ZHA, and the release mechanism was described by the Elovich model. The hybrid materials show potential characteristics for use as bioactive delivery systems.},

ABSTRACT = {Graphene is a promising platform for surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS)-active substrates, primarily due to the possibility of quenching photoluminescence and fluorescence. Here we study ultrathin gold films near the percolation threshold fabricated by electron-beam deposition on monolayer CVD graphene. The advantages of such hybrid graphene/gold substrates for surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy are discussed in comparison with conventional substrates without the graphene layer. The percolation threshold is determined by independent measurements of the sheet resistance and effective dielectric constant by spectroscopic ellipsometry. The surface morphology of the ultrathin gold films is analyzed by the use of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM), and the thicknesses of the films in addition to the quartz-crystal mass-thickness sensor are also measured by AFM. We experimentally demonstrate that the maximum SERS signal is observed near and slightly below the percolation threshold. In this case, the region of maximum enhancement of the SERS signal can be determined using the figure of merit (FOM), which is the ratio of the real and imaginary parts of the effective dielectric permittivity of the films. SERS measurements on hybrid graphene/gold substrates with the dye Crystal Violet show an enhancement factor of ~105 and also demonstrate the ability of graphene to quench photoluminescence by an average of ~60%.},

ABSTRACT = {The development of new catalytic nanomaterials following sustainability criteria both in their composition and in their synthesis process is a topic of great current interest. The purpose of this work was to investigate the preparation of nanocatalysts derived from the zirconium metal–organic framework UiO-66 obtained under friendly conditions and supporting dispersed species of non-noble transition elements such as Cu, Co, and Fe, incorporated through a simple incipient wetness impregnation technique. The physicochemical properties of the synthesized solids were studied through several characterization techniques and then they were investigated in reactions of relevance for environmental pollution control, such as the oxidation of carbon monoxide in air and in hydrogen-rich streams (COProx). By controlling the atmospheres and pretreatment temperatures, it was possible to obtain active catalysts for the reactions under study, consisting of Cu-based UiO-66-, bimetallic CuCo–UiO-66-, and CuFe–UiO-6-derived materials. These solids represent new alternatives of nanostructured catalysts based on highly dispersed non-noble active metals.},

ABSTRACT = {Cobalt sulfide composites have exhibited great potential in terms of microwave absorption, owing to their low price, relatively high capacitance, and excellent electrocatalytic activity. Thus, a novel core-shell like structure comprising cobalt sulfide@polypyrrole (CoS@PPy) composite was synthesized by a facile solvothermal synthesis method and in situ polymerization. When coated by the heterostructure polypyrrole aerogel, CoS@PPy composite exhibited excellent microwave absorption properties with an optimal reflection loss (RL) of −41.8 dB at 6.96 GHz. Furthermore, the absorption bandwidth (RL < −10 dB) of 5.4 GHz could be reached at a coating thickness of 2.05 mm, probably attributing to the synergistic effect of good impedance matching, interfacial polarization, dipole polarization, and conductivity loss. Moreover, this work proposed a loss mechanism mode which probably occurred in the CoS@PPy composites. It was demonstrated that the CoS@PPy composite is a promising material in the field of electromagnetic wave absorption.},

ABSTRACT = {The enhancement of photoelectrochemical conversion efficiency of p-type dye-sensitized solar cells (p-DSSCs) is necessary to build up effective tandem devices in which both anode and cathode are photoactive. The efficiency of a p-type device (2.5%) is roughly one order of magnitude lower than the n-type counterparts (13.1%), thus limiting the overall efficiency of the tandem cell, especially in terms of powered current density. This is mainly due to the recombination reaction that occurs especially at the photocathode (or Indium-doped Tin Oxide (ITO))/electrolyte interface. To minimize this phenomenon, a widely employed strategy is to deposit a compact film of NiO (acting as a blocking electrode) beneath the porous electrode. Here, we propose electrodeposition as a cheap, easy scalable and environmental-friendly approach to deposit nanometric films directly on ITO glass. The results are compared to a blocking layer made by means of sol-gel technique. Cells embodying a blocking layer substantially outperformed the reference device. Among them, BL_1.10V shows the best photoconversion efficiency (0.166%) and one of the highest values of fill factor (approaching 46%) ever reported. This is mainly due to an optimized surface roughness of the blocking layer assuring a good deposition of the porous layer. The effectiveness of the implementation of the blocking layer is further proved by means of Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy.},

ABSTRACT = {Magnetite nanoparticles (Fe3O4) functionalized with graphene oxide (GO) have been synthesized through a silanization process of the magnetic nanoparticles with tetraethyl orthosilicate and (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane and further coupling of GO. The synthesized nanomaterials have been characterized by several techniques, such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and infrared and Raman spectroscopy, which enabled the evaluation of the different steps of the functionalization process. The hybrid nanomaterial has been employed for the extraction of five benzophenones (benzophenone-1, benzophenone-3, 4-hydroxybenzophenone, benzophenone-6 and benzophenone-8) in aqueous samples by dispersive micro-solid phase extraction, combining the magnetic properties of magnetite nanoparticles with the excellent sorption capacity of graphene oxide via hydrophobic interactions with the analytes. The subsequent separation and quantification of the analytes was performed by liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometric detection, achieving limits of detection (LODs) in the range 2.5 to 8.2 μg·L−1, with relative standard deviations ranging from 1.3–9.8% and relative recovering in the range 86 to 105%. Positive swimming pool water samples analysed following the developed method revealed the presence of benzophenones in from 14.3 to 39 μg·L−1.},

ABSTRACT = {New magnetic iron oxide (Fe3O4)/activated charcoal (AC)/β-cyclodextrin (CD)/sodium alginate (Alg) polymer nanocomposite materials were prepared by direct mixing of the polymer matrix with the nanofillers. The obtained materials were utilized as nano-adsorbents for the elimination of methylene blue (MB), a hazardous water-soluble cationic dye, from aqueous solutions, and showed excellent regeneration capacity. The formation of the nanocomposites was followed by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) equipped with energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDX), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and adsorption of N2 at −196 °C. The rate of adsorption was investigated varying several factors, namely contact time, pH, amount of adsorbent and MB concentration on the adsorption process. Studies dealing with equilibrium and kinetics were carried out in batch conditions. The obtained results indicated that the removal rate of MB was 99.53% in 90 min. Langmuir’s isotherm fitted better to the equilibrium data of MB. Fe3O4/AC/CD/Alg polymer beads shows amazing adsorption capacities in the elimination of cationic dyes (2.079 mg/g for polymer gel beads and 10.63 mg g−1 for dry powder beads), in comparison to other adsorbent materials. The obtained adsorbent is spherical with hydrophobic cross-linked surface properties that enable an easy recovery without any significant weight loss of in the adsorbent used.},

ABSTRACT = {Advances in nanoscale science and engineering are providing new opportunities to develop promising adsorbents for environmental remediation. Here, hybrid aerogels are assembled from cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) and carbon nanomaterials to remove cationic dye methylene blue (MB) and anionic dye Congo red (CR) in single and binary systems. Two classes of carbon nanomaterials, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene nanoplates (GnPs), are incorporated into CNFs with various amounts, respectively. The adsorption, mechanics and structure properties of the hybrid aerogels are investigated and compared among different combinations. The results demonstrate CNF–GnP 3:1 hybrid exhibits the best performance among all composites. Regarding a single dye system, both dye adsorptions follow a pseudo-second-order adsorption kinetic and monolayer Langmuir adsorption isotherm. The maximal adsorption capacities of CNF–GnP aerogels for MB and CR are 1178.5 mg g−1 and 585.3 mg g−1, respectively. CNF–GnP hybrid show a superior binary dye adsorption capacity than pristine CNF or GnP. Furthermore, nearly 80% of MB or CR can be desorbed from CNF–GNP using ethanol as the desorption agent, indicating the reusability of this hybrid material. Hence, the CNF–GnP aerogels show great promise as adsorption materials for wastewater treatment.},

ABSTRACT = {Inorganic-based nanoelements such as nanoparticles (nanodots), nanopillars and nanowires, which have at least one dimension of 100 nm or less, have been extensively developed for biomedical applications. Furthermore, their properties can be varied by controlling such parameters as element shape, size, surface functionalization, and mutual interactions. In this study, Ni-alumina nanocomposite material was synthesized by the dc-Ni electrodeposition into a porous anodic alumina template (PAAT). The structural, morphological, and corrosion properties were studied using x-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and electrochemical techniques (linear sweep voltammetry). Template technology was used to obtain Ni nanopillars (NiNPs) in the PAAT nanocomposite. Low corrosion current densities (order of 0.5 µA/cm2) were indicators of this nanocomposite adequate corrosion resistance in artificial physiological solution (0.9% NaCl). A porous anodic alumina template is barely exposed to corrosion and performs protective functions in the composite. The results may be useful for the development of new nanocomposite materials technologies for a variety of biomedical applications including catalysis and nanoelectrodes for sensing and fuel cells. They are also applicable for various therapeutic purposes including targeting, diagnosis, magnetic hyperthermia, and drug delivery. Therefore, it is an ambitious task to research the corrosion resistance of these magnetic nanostructures in simulated body fluid.},

ABSTRACT = {Separation of CO2/CH4/N2 is significantly important from the view of environmental protection and energy utilization. In this work, we reported nitrogen (N)-doped porous carbon spheres prepared from sustainable biomass glucose via hydrothermal carbonization, CO2 activation, and urea treatment. The optimal carbon sample exhibited a high CO2 and CH4 capacity, as well as a low N2 uptake, under ambient conditions. The excellent selectivities toward CO2/N2, CO2/CH4, and CH4/N2 binary mixtures were predicted by ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST) via correlating pure component adsorption isotherms with the Langmuir−Freundlich model. At 25 °C and 1 bar, the adsorption capacities for CO2 and CH4 were 3.03 and 1.3 mmol g−1, respectively, and the IAST predicated selectivities for CO2/N2 (15/85), CO2/CH4 (10/90), and CH4/N2 (30/70) reached 16.48, 7.49, and 3.76, respectively. These results should be attributed to the synergistic effect between suitable microporous structure and desirable N content. This report introduces a simple pathway to obtain N-doped porous carbon spheres to meet the flue gas and energy gas adsorptive separation requirements.},

ABSTRACT = {Nanopriming has been shown to significantly improve seed germination and seedling vigor in several agricultural crops. However, this approach has not been applied to native upland boreal forest species with complex seed dormancy to improve propagation. Herein, we demonstrate the effectiveness of carbon nanoparticles functionalized with carboxylic acids in resolving seed dormancy and improved the propagation of two native upland boreal forest species. Seed priming with carbon nanoparticles functionalized with carboxylic acids followed by stratification were observed to be the most effective in improving germination to 90% in green alder (Alnus viridis L.) compared to 60% in the control. Conversely, a combination of carbon nanoparticles (CNPs), especially multiwall carbon nanoparticles functionalized with carboxylic acid (MWCNT–COOH), cold stratification, mechanical scarification and hormonal priming (gibberellic acid) was effective for buffaloberry seeds (Shepherdia canadensis L.). Both concentrations (20 µg and 40 µg) of MWCNT–COOH had a higher percent germination (90%) compared to all other treatments. Furthermore, we observed the improvement in germination, seedling vigor and resolution of both embryo and seed coat dormancy in upland boreal forest species appears to be associated with the remodeling of C18:3 enriched fatty acids in the following seed membrane lipid molecular species: PC18:1/18:3, PG16:1/18:3, PE18:3/18:2, and digalactosyldiacylglycerol (DGDG18:3/18:3). These findings suggest that nanopriming may be a useful approach to resolve seed dormancy issues and improve the seed germination in non-resource upland boreal forest species ideally suited for forest reclamation following resource mining.},

ABSTRACT = {Due to the “shuttle effect”, the cycle performance of lithium sulfur (Li-S) battery is poor and the capacity decays rapidly. Replacing lithium-ion battery is the maximum problem to be overcome. In order to solve this problem, we use a cage like microporous MOF(CPM-5) as a carbon source, which is carbonized at high temperature to get a micro-mesoporous carbon composite material. In addition, indium oxide particles formed during carbonization are deposited on CPM-5 structure, forming a simple core-shell structure CPM-5-C-600. When it is used as the cathode of Li-S battery, the small molecule sulfide can be confined in the micropores, while the existence of large pore size mesopores can provide a channel for the transmission of lithium ions, so as to improve the conductivity of the material and the rate performance of the battery. After 100 cycles, the specific capacity of the battery can be still maintained at 650 mA h·g−1 and the Coulombic efficiency is close to 100%. When the rate goes up to 2 C, the first discharge capacity not only can reach 1400 mA h·g−1, but also still provides 500 mA h·g−1 after 200 cycles, showing excellent rate performance.},

ABSTRACT = {Herein, a coprecipitation method used to synthesize CuS nanostructures is reported. By varying the reaction time and temperature, the evolution of the CuS morphology between nanoparticles and nanoflakes was investigated. It was found that CuS easily crystallizes into sphere-/ellipsoid-like nanoparticles within a short reaction time (0.5 h) or at a high reaction temperature (120 °C), whereas CuS nanoflakes are readily formed at a low reaction temperature (20 °C) for a long time (12 h). Photodegradation experiments demonstrate that CuS nanoflakes exhibit a higher photodegradation performance than CuS nanoparticles for removing rhodamine B (RhB) from aqueous solution under simulated sunlight irradiation. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were further used to modify the photodegradation performance of a CuS photocatalyst. To achieve this aim, CNTs and CuS were integrated to form CNT/CuS hybrid composites via an in situ coprecipitation method. In the in situ constructed CNT/CuS composites, CuS is preferably formed as nanoparticles, but cannot be crystallized into nanoflakes. Compared to bare CuS, the CNT/CuS composites manifest an obviously enhanced photodegradation of RhB; notably, the 3% CNT/CuS composite with CNT content of 3% showed the highest photodegradation performance (η = 89.4% for 120 min reaction, kapp = 0.01782 min−1). To make a comparison, CuS nanoflakes and CNTs were mechanically mixed in absolute alcohol and then dried to obtain the 3% CNT/CuS-MD composite. It was observed that the 3% CNT/CuS-MD composite exhibited a slightly higher photodegradation performance (η = 92.4%, kapp = 0.0208 min−1) than the 3% CNT/CuS composite, which may be attributed to the fact that CuS maintains the morphology of nanoflakes in the 3% CNT/CuS-MD composite. The underlying enhanced photocatalytic mechanism of the CNT/CuS composites was systematically investigated and discussed.},

ABSTRACT = {Manual and mechanical suturing are currently the gold standard for bowel anastomosis. If tissue approximation fails, anastomotic leaks occur. Anastomotic leaks may have catastrophic consequences. The development of a fully absorbable, biocompatible sealant material based on a bio-ink silk fibroin can reduce the chance of anastomotic leaks. We have produced a Ca-modified plasticised regenerated silk (RS) with gold nanorods sealant. This sealant was applied to anastomosed porcine intestine. Water absorption from wet tissue substrate applied compressive strains on hybrid RS films. This compression results in a sealant effect on anastomosis. The increased toughness of the hybrid plasticised RS resulted in the designing of a bio-film with superior elongation at break (i.e., ≈200%) and bursting pressure. We have also reported structure-dependent piezoelectricity of the RS film that shows a piezoelectric effect out of the plane. We hope that in the future, bowel anastomosis can be simplified by providing a multifunctional bio-film that makes feasible the mechanical tissue joint without the need for specific tools and could be used in piezoelectric sealant heads.},

ABSTRACT = {Pharmaceutical residuals are increasingly detected in natural waters, which made great threat to the health of the public. This study evaluated the utility of the photo-Fenton ceramic membrane filtration toward the removal and degradation of sulfamethoxazole (SMX) as a model recalcitrant micropollutant. The photo-Fenton catalyst Goethite (α-FeOOH) was coated on planar ceramic membranes as we reported previously. The removal of SMX in both simulated and real toilet wastewater were assessed by filtering the feed solutions with/without H2O2 and UV irradiation. The SMX degradation rate reached 87% and 92% respectively in the presence of UV/H2O2 for the original toilet wastewater (0.8 ± 0.05 ppb) and toilet wastewater with a spiked SMX concentration of 100 ppb. The mineralization and degradation by-products were both assessed under different degradation conditions to achieve deeper insight into the degradation mechanisms during this photo-Fenton reactive membrane filtration. Results showed that a negligible removal rate (e.g., 3%) of SMX was obtained when only filtering the feed solution through uncoated or catalyst-coated membranes. However, the removal rates of SMX were significantly increased to 67% (no H2O2) and 90% (with H2O2) under UV irradiation, respectively, confirming that photo-Fenton reactions played the key role in the degradation/mineralization process. The highest apparent quantum yield (AQY) reached up to approximately 27% when the H2O2 was 10 mmol·L−1 and UV254 intensity was 100 μW·cm−2. This study lays the groundwork for reactive membrane filtration to tackle the issues from micropollution.},

ABSTRACT = {The recently introduced perovskite solar cell (PSC) technology is a promising candidate for providing low-cost energy for future demands. However, one major concern with the technology can be traced back to morphological defects in the electron selective layer (ESL), which deteriorates the solar cell performance. Pinholes in the ESL may lead to an increased surface recombination rate for holes, if the perovskite absorber layer is in contact with the fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate via the pinholes. In this work, we used sol-gel-derived mesoporous TiO2 thin films prepared by block co-polymer templating in combination with dip coating as a model system for investigating the effect of ESL pinholes on the photovoltaic performance of planar heterojunction PSCs. We studied TiO2 films with different porosities and film thicknesses, and observed that the induced pinholes only had a minor impact on the device performance. This suggests that having narrow pinholes with a diameter of about 10 nm in the ESL is in fact not detrimental for the device performance and can even, to some extent improve their performance. A probable reason for this is that the narrow pores in the ordered structure do not allow the perovskite crystals to form interconnected pathways to the underlying FTO substrate. However, for ultrathin (~20 nm) porous layers, an incomplete ESL surface coverage of the FTO layer will further deteriorate the device performance.},
