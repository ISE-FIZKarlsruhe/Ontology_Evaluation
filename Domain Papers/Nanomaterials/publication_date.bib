ABSTRACT = {Heavy metal poisoning has a life-threatening impact on the human body to aquatic ecosystems. This necessitates designing a convenient green methodology for the fabrication of an electrochemical sensor that can detect heavy metal ions efficiently. In this study, boron (B) and nitrogen (N) co-doped laser-induced porous graphene (LIGBN) nanostructured electrodes were fabricated using a direct laser writing technique. The fabricated electrodes were utilised for the individual and simultaneous electrochemical detection of lead (Pb2+) and cadmium (Cd2+) ions using a square wave voltammetry technique (SWV). The synergistic effect of B and N co-doping results in an improved sensing performance of the electrode with better sensitivity of 0.725 µA/µM for Pb2+ and 0.661 µA/µM for Cd2+ ions, respectively. Moreover, the sensing electrode shows a low limit of detection of 0.21 µM and 0.25 µM for Pb2+ and Cd2+ ions, with wide linear ranges from 8.0 to 80 µM for Pb2+ and Cd2+ ions and high linearity of R2 = 0.99 in case of simultaneous detection. This rapid and facile method of fabricating heteroatom-doped porous graphene opens a new avenue in electrochemical sensing studies to detect various hazardous metal ions.},

ABSTRACT = {Micro- and nanoplastics (MNPs) have become ubiquitous contaminants of water and foods, resulting in high levels of human ingestion exposure. MNPs have been found in human blood and multiple tissues, suggesting that they are readily absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) and widely distributed. Growing toxicological evidence suggests that ingested MNPs may pose a serious health threat. The potential genotoxicity of MNPs, however, remains largely unknown. In this study, genotoxicity of primary and environmentally relevant secondary MNPs was assessed in a triculture small intestinal epithelium (SIE) model using the CometChip assay. Aqueous suspensions of 25 and 1000 nm carboxylated polystyrene spheres (PS25C and PS1KC), and incinerated polyethylene (PEI PM0.1) were subjected to simulated GIT digestion to create physiologically relevant exposures (digestas), which were applied to the SIE model at final MNP concentrations of 1, 5, and 20 μg/mL for 24 or 48 h. PS25C and PS1KC induced DNA damage in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. To our knowledge, this is one of the first assessment of MNP genotoxicity in an integrated in vitro ingestion platform including simulated GIT digestion and a triculture SIE model. These findings suggest that ingestion of high concentrations of carboxylated PS MNPs could have serious genotoxic consequences in the SIE.},

ABSTRACT = {This research focuses on developing a 2D thin film comprising a monolayer of silica nanoparticles functionalized with polyethyleneimine (PEI), achieved through a novel integration of Langmuir–Blodgett (L-B) and Pickering emulsion techniques. The primary aim was to create a nanostructured film that exhibits dual functionality: iridescence and efficient metal ion adsorption, specifically Cu(II) ions. The methodology combined L-B and Pickering emulsion polymerization to assemble and stabilize a nanoparticle monolayer at an oil/water interface, which was then polymerized under UV radiation to form an asymmetrically structured film. The results demonstrate that the film possesses a high adsorption efficiency for Cu(II) ions, with the enhanced mechanical durability provided by a reinforcing layer of polyvinyl alcohol/glycerol. The advantage of combining L-B and Pickering emulsion technology is the ability to generate 2D films from functional nanoparticle monolayers that are sufficiently sturdy to be deployed in applications. The 2D film’s practical applications in environmental remediation were confirmed through its ability to adsorb and recover Cu(II) ions from aqueous solutions effectively. We thus demonstrate the film’s potential as a versatile tool in water treatment applications owing to its combined photonic and adsorptive properties. This work paves the way for future research on the use of nanoengineered films in environmental and possibly photonic applications focusing on enhancing the film’s structural robustness and exploring its broader applicability to other pollutants and metal ions.},

ABSTRACT = {With the rapid development of anion exchange membrane technology and the availability of high-performance non-noble metal cathode catalysts in alkaline media, the commercialization of anion exchange membrane fuel cells has become feasible. Currently, anode materials for alkaline anion-exchange membrane fuel cells still rely on platinum-based catalysts, posing a challenge to the development of efficient low-Pt or Pt-free catalysts. Low-cost ruthenium-based anodes are being considered as alternatives to platinum. However, they still suffer from stability issues and strong oxophilicity. Here, we employ a metal–organic framework compound as a template to construct three-dimensional porous ruthenium–tungsten–zinc nanocages via solvothermal and high-temperature pyrolysis methods. The experimental results demonstrate that this porous ruthenium–tungsten–zinc nanocage with an electrochemical surface area of 116 m2 g−1 exhibits excellent catalytic activity for hydrogen oxidation reaction in alkali, with a kinetic density 1.82 times and a mass activity 8.18 times higher than that of commercial Pt/C, and a good catalytic stability, showing no obvious degradation of the current density after continuous operation for 10,000 s. These findings suggest that the developed catalyst holds promise for use in alkaline anion-exchange membrane fuel cells.},

ABSTRACT = {A novel biomass-based magnetic nanoparticle (Fe3O4-P-CMC/PAMAM) was synthesized by crosslinking carboxymethyl chitosan (CMC) and poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM), followed by phosphorylation with the incorporation of magnetic ferric oxide nanoparticles. The characterization results verified the successful functionalization and structural integrity of the adsorbents with a surface area of ca. 43 m2/g. Batch adsorption experiments revealed that the adsorbent exhibited a maximum adsorption capacity of 1513.47 mg·g−1 for U(VI) at pH 5.5 and 298.15 K, with Fe3O4-P-CMC/G1.5-2 showing the highest affinity among the series. The adsorption kinetics adhered to a pseudo-second-order model (R2 = 0.99, qe,exp = 463.81 mg·g−1, k2 = 2.15×10−2 g·mg−1·min−1), indicating a chemically driven process. Thermodynamic analysis suggested that the adsorption was endothermic and spontaneous (ΔH° = 14.71 kJ·mol−1, ΔG° = −50.63 kJ·mol−1, 298. 15 K), with increasing adsorption capacity at higher temperatures. The adsorbent demonstrated significant selectivity for U(VI) in the presence of competing cations, with Fe3O4-P-CMC/G1.5-2 showing a high selectivity coefficient. The performed desorption and reusability tests indicated that the adsorbent could be effectively regenerated using 1M HCl, maintaining its adsorption capacity after five cycles. XPS analysis highlighted the role of phosphonate and amino groups in the complexation with uranyl ions, and validated the existence of bimodal U4f peaks at 380.1 eV and 390.1 eV belonging to U 4f7/2 and U 4f5/2. The results of this study underscore the promise of the developed adsorbent as an effective and selective material for the treatment of uranium-contaminated wastewater.},

ABSTRACT = {Herein, we investigate the effect of tilt mismatch on the quantum oscillations of spin transport properties in two-dimensional asymmetrically tilted Dirac cone systems. This study involves the examination of conductance oscillation in two distinct junction types: transverse- and longitudinal-tilted Dirac cones (TTDCs and LTDCs). Our findings reveal an unusual quantum oscillation of spin-polarized conductance within the TTDC system, characterized by two distinct anomaly patterns within a single period, labeled as the linear conductance phase and the oscillatory conductance phase. Interestingly, these phases emerge in association with tilt-induced orbital pseudo-magnetization and exchange interaction. Our study also demonstrates that the structure of the LTDC can modify the frequency of spin conductance oscillation, and the asymmetric effect within this structure results in a quantum beating pattern in oscillatory spin conductance. We note that an enhancement in the asymmetric longitudinal tilt velocity ratio within the structure correspondingly amplifies the beating frequency. Our research potentially contributes valuable insights for detecting the asymmetry of tilted Dirac fermions in type-I Dirac semimetal-based spintronics and quantum devices.},

ABSTRACT = {Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) gas sensors are pivotal in upholding environmental integrity and human health, necessitating heightened sensitivity and exceptional selectivity. Despite the prevalent use of metal oxide semiconductors (MOSs) for NO2 detection, extant solutions exhibit shortcomings in meeting practical application criteria, specifically in response, selectivity, and operational temperatures. Here, we successfully employed a facile microwave-solvothermal method to synthesize a mesoporous CeO2/CNCs nanocomposite. This methodology entails the rapid and comprehensive dispersion of CeO2 nanoparticles onto helical carbon nanocoils (CNCs), resulting in augmented electronic conductivity and an abundance of active sites within the composite. Consequently, the gas-sensing sensitivity of the nanocomposite at room temperature experienced a notable enhancement. Moreover, the presence of cerium oxide and the conversion of Ce3+ and Ce4+ ions facilitated the generation of oxygen vacancies in the composites, thereby further amplifying the sensing performance. Experimental outcomes demonstrate that the nanocomposite exhibited an approximate 9-fold increase in response to 50 ppm NO2 in comparison to pure CNCs at room temperature. Additionally, the CeO2/CNCs sensor displayed remarkable selectivity towards NO2 when exposed to gases such as NH3, CO, SO2, CO2, and C2H5OH. This straightforward microwave-solvothermal method presents an appealing strategy for the research and development of intelligent sensors based on CNCs nanomaterials.},

ABSTRACT = {Carbon dots (CDs) possess a considerable number of beneficial features for latent applications in biotargeted drugs, electronic transistors, and encrypted information. The synthesis of fluorescent carbon dots has become a trend in contemporary research, especially in the field of controllable multicolor fluorescent carbon dots. In this study, an elementary one-step hydrothermal method was employed to synthesize the multicolor fluorescent carbon dots by co-doping unique phenylenediamine isomers (o-PD, m-PD, and p-PD) with B and P elements, which under 365 nm UV light exhibited signs of lavender-color, grass-color, and tangerine-color fluorescence, respectively. Further investigations reveal the distinctness in the polymerization, surface-specific functional groups, and graphite N content of the multicolor CDs, which may be the chief factor regarding the different optical behaviors of the multicolor CDs. This new work offers a route for the exploration of multicolor CDs using B/P co-doping and suggests great potential in the field of optical materials, important information encryption, and commercial anticounterfeiting labels.},

ABSTRACT = {(AlCrTiZrMox)N coatings with varying Mo content were successfully prepared using a multi-target co-deposition magnetron sputtering system. The results reveal that the Mo content significantly affects the microstructure, hardness, fracture toughness, and tribological behavior of the coatings. As the Mo content in the coatings increases gradually, the preferred orientation changes from (200) to (111). The coatings consistently exhibit a distinct columnar structure. Additionally, the hardness of the coatings increases from 24.39 to 30.24 GPa, along with an increase in fracture toughness. The friction coefficient is reduced from 0.72 to 0.26, and the wear rate is reduced by 10 times. During the friction process, the inter-column regions of the coatings are initially damaged, causing the wear track to exhibit a wavy pattern. Greater frictional heat is generated at the crest of the wave, resulting in the formation of a MoO2 lubricating layer. The friction reaction helps to reduce the shear force during friction, demonstrating the lower friction coefficient of the (AlCrTiZrMox)N coatings. Both the hardness and fracture toughness work together to reduce the wear rate, and the (AlCrTiZrMox)N coatings show excellent wear resistance. Most notably, although the columnar structure plays a negative role in the hardness, it contributes greatly to the wear resistance.},

ABSTRACT = {In this study, the synergetic action of nanopulsed plasma bubbles (PBs) and photocatalysts for the degradation/mineralization of trimethoprim (TMP) in water was investigated. The effects of ZnO or TiO2 loading, plasma gas, and initial TMP concentration were evaluated. The physicochemical characterization of plasma-treated water, the quantification of plasma species, and the use of appropriate plasma species scavengers shed light on the plasma-catalytic mechanism. ZnO proved to be a superior catalyst compared to TiO2 when combined with plasma bubbles, mainly due to the increased production of ⋅OH and oxygen species resulting from the decomposition of O3. The air–PBs + ZnO system resulted in higher TMP degradation (i.e., 95% after 5 min of treatment) compared to the air–PBs + TiO2 system (i.e., 87%) and the PBs-alone process (83%). The plasma gas strongly influenced the process, with O2 resulting in the best performance and Ar being insufficient to drive the process. The synergy between air–PBs and ZnO was more profound (SF = 1.7), while ZnO also promoted the already high O2–plasma bubbles’ performance, resulting in a high TOC removal rate (i.e., 71%). The electrical energy per order in the PBs + ZnO system was very low, ranging from 0.23 to 0.46 kWh/m3, depending on the plasma gas and initial TMP concentration. The study provides valuable insights into the rapid and cost-effective degradation of emerging contaminants like TMP and the plasma-catalytic mechanism of antibiotics.},

ABSTRACT = {Climate neutrality for the year 2050 is the goal assumed at the level of the EU27+UK. As Romania is no exception, it has assumed the gradual mitigation of pollution generated by the energy sector, and by 2030, according to ‘Fit for 55’, the share of energy from renewable sources must reach 42.5% from total energy consumption. For the rest of the energy produced from traditional sources, natural gas and/or coal, modern technologies will be used to retain the gaseous noxes. Even if they are not greenhouse gases, NO and SO2, generated from fossil fuel combustion, cause negative effects on the environment and biodiversity. The adsorption capacity of different materials, three nanomaterials developed in-house and three commercial adsorbents, both for NO and SO2, was tackled through gas chromatography, elemental analysis, and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. Fe-BTC has proven to be an excellent material for separation efficiency and adsorption capacity under studied conditions, and is shown to be versatile both in the case of NO (80.00 cm3/g) and SO2 (63.07 cm3/g). All the developed nanomaterials generated superior results in comparison to the commercial adsorbents. The increase in pressure enhanced the performance of the absorption process, while temperature showed an opposite influence, by blocking the active centers on the surface.},

ABSTRACT = {Recent advancements in marine technology have highlighted the urgent need for enhanced underwater acoustic applications, from sonar detection to communication and noise cancellation, driving the pursuit of innovative transducer technologies. In this paper, a new underwater thermoacoustic (TA) transducer made from carbon nanotube (CNT) sponge is designed to achieve wide bandwidth, high energy conversion efficiency, simple structure, good transient response, and stable sound response, utilizing the TA effect through electro-thermal modulation. The transducer has potential application in underwater acoustic communication. An electro-thermal-acoustic coupled simulation for the open model, sandwich model, and encapsulated model is presented to analyze the transient behaviors of CNT sponge TA transducers in liquid environments. The effects of key design parameters on the acoustic performances of both systems are revealed. The results demonstrate that a short pulse excitation with a low duty cycle could greatly improve the heat dissipation of the encapsulated transducer, especially when the thermoacoustic response time becomes comparable to thermal relaxation time.},

ABSTRACT = {Although titanium dioxide (TiO2) has a wide range of potential applications, the photocatalytic performance of TiO2 is limited by both its limited photoresponse range and fast recombination of the photogenerated charge carriers. In this work, the preparation of nitrogen (N)-doped TiO2 accompanied by the introduction of oxygen vacancy (Vo) has been achieved via a facile annealing treatment with urea as the N source. During the annealing treatment, the presence of urea not only realizes the N-doping of TiO2 but also creates Vo in N-doped TiO2 (N-TiO2), which is also suitable for commercial TiO2 (P25). Unexpectedly, the annealing treatment-induced decrease in the specific surface area of N-TiO2 is inhibited by the N-doping and, thus, more active sites are maintained. Therefore, both the N-doping and formation of Vo as well as the increased active sites contribute to the excellent photocatalytic performance of N-TiO2 under visible light irradiation. Our work offers a facile strategy for the preparation of N-TiO2 with Vo via the annealing treatment with urea.},

We demonstrate that the photothermal performances of the nanoparticles are strongly related not only to their plasmonic properties but also to the size and shape of the nanoparticles. The contribution of the longitudinal and transversal modes in gold nanobipyramids is also analyzed in terms of heat generation. These results will guide us to design appropriate nanoparticles to act as efficient heat nanosources.},

ABSTRACT = {Due to the very efficient relaxation of elastic stress on strain-free sidewalls, III–V nanowires offer almost unlimited possibilities for bandgap engineering in nanowire heterostructures by using material combinations that are attainable in epilayers. However, axial nanowire heterostructures grown using the vapor–liquid–solid method often suffer from the reservoir effect in a catalyst droplet. Control over the interfacial abruptness in nanowire heterostructures based on the group V interchange is more difficult than for group-III-based materials, because the low concentrations of highly volatile group V atoms cannot be measured after or during growth. Here, we develop a self-consistent model for calculations of the coordinate-dependent compositional profiles in the solid and liquid phases during the vapor–liquid–solid growth of the axial nanowire heterostructure Ax0B1−x0C/Ax1B1−x1C with any stationary compositions x0 and x1. The only assumption of the model is that the growth rates of both binaries AC and BC are proportional to the concentrations of group V atoms A and B in a catalyst droplet, requiring high enough supersaturations in liquid phase. The model contains a minimum number of parameters and fits quite well the data on the interfacial abruptness across double heterostructures in GaP/GaAsxP1−x/GaP nanowires. It can be used for any axial III–V nanowire heterostructures obtained through the vapor–liquid–solid method. It forms a basis for further developments in modeling the complex growth process and suppression of the interfacial broadening caused by the reservoir effect.},

ABSTRACT = {Carbon nanotube (CNT) is an excellent field emission material. However, uniformity and stability are the key issues hampering its device application. In this work, a bimetallic W-Co alloy was adopted as the catalyst of CNT in chemical vapor deposition process. The high melting point and stable crystal structure of W-Co helps to increase the grown CNT diameter uniformity and homogeneous crystal structure. High-crystallinity CNTs were grown on the W-Co bimetallic catalyst. Its field emission characteristics demonstrated a low turn-on field, high current density, stable current stability, and uniform emission distribution. The Fowler–Nordheim (FN) and Seppen–Katamuki (SK) analyses revealed that the CNT grown on the W-Co catalyst has a relatively low work function and high field enhancement factor. The high crystallinity and homogeneous crystal structure of CNT also reduce the body resistance and increase the emission current stability and maximum current. The result provides a way to synthesis a high-quality CNT field emitter, which will accelerate the development of cold cathode vacuum electronic device application.},

The findings reveal that all crystals exhibit luminescence and active optical waveguiding, demonstrating the ability to adjust their luminescence within a broad spectral range of 550–700 nm depending on the donor group attached to the benzoselenadiazole core. Notably, a clear relationship exists between the HOMO-LUMO energy gaps of each compound and the color emission of the corresponding optical waveguides. These outcomes affirm the feasibility of modifying the color emission of organic waveguides through suitable chemical functionalization. Importantly, this study marks the first utilization of benzoseleniadiazole derivatives for such purposes, underscoring the originality of this research. In addition, the obtention of nanocrystals is a key tool for the implementation of miniaturized photonic devices.},

ABSTRACT = {The affinity between carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and organic compounds is of substantial importance since it strongly relates to the dispersibility of CNTs in those compounds. Several affinity evaluation methods have been developed so far, and the concept of the Hansen solubility parameter is a representative method widely used in the field of nanocarbon materials. Here, we demonstrate that CNT-loaded silica columns can effectively assess the affinity of organic compounds for CNT surface by exploiting the chromatographic retention time as a criterion. Obtained trends of the affinity of organic compounds for CNT were compared to those based on Hansen solubility parameter distance values. Most organic compounds showed similar trends, but one exceptional compound was observed. Simple CNT dispersion tests were conducted with these organic compounds to demonstrate the advantage of the chromatographic assessment. Further, we conducted comparison experiments using a pyrene-functionalized column and other CNT-loaded columns to elucidate the characteristics of each CNT column. The chromatographic approaches using CNT columns would be beneficial for realizing CNT suspensions with improved CNT dispersibility.},

ABSTRACT = {Binary transition metal oxide complexes (BTMOCs) in three-dimensional (3D) layered structures show great promise as electrodes for supercapacitors (SCs) due to their diverse oxidation states, which contribute to high specific capacitance. However, the synthesis of BTMOCs with 3D structures remains challenging yet crucial for their application. In this study, we present a novel approach utilizing a single-step hydrothermal technique to fabricate flower-shaped microspheres composed of a NiCo-based complex. Each microsphere consists of nanosheets with a mesoporous structure, enhancing the specific surface area to 23.66 m2 g−1 and facilitating efficient redox reactions. When employed as the working electrode for supercapacitors, the composite exhibits remarkable specific capacitance, achieving 888.8 F g−1 at 1 A g−1. Furthermore, it demonstrates notable electrochemical stability, retaining 52.08% capacitance after 10,000 cycles, and offers a high-power density of 225 W·kg−1, along with an energy density of 25 Wh·kg−1, showcasing its potential for energy storage applications. Additionally, an aqueous asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) was assembled using NiCo microspheres-based complex and activated carbon (AC). Remarkably, the NiCo microspheres complex/AC configuration delivers a high specific capacitance of 250 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, with a high energy density of 88 Wh kg−1, for a power density of 800 W kg−1. The ASC also exhibits excellent long-term cyclability with 69% retention over 10,000 charge–discharge cycles. Furthermore, a series of two ASC devices demonstrated the capability to power commercial blue LEDs for a duration of at least 40 s. The simplicity of the synthesis process and the exceptional performance exhibited by the developed electrode materials hold considerable promise for applications in energy storage.},

ABSTRACT = {Iron oxide nanoparticles (IONs) with good water dispersibility were prepared by the thermal decomposition of iron acetylacetonate (Fe(acac)3) in the high-boiling organic solvent polyethylene glycol (PEG) using polyethyleneimine (PEI) as a modifier. The nucleation and growth processes of the crystals were separated during the reaction process by batch additions of the reaction material, which could inhibit the nucleation but maintain the crystal growth, and products with larger particle sizes and high saturation magnetization were obtained. The method of batch addition of the reactant prepared IONs with the largest particle size and the highest saturation magnetization compared with IONs reported using PEG as the reaction solvent. The IONs prepared by this method also retained good water dispersibility. Therefore, these IONs are potentially suitable for the magnetic separation of cells, proteins, or nucleic acids when large magnetic responses are needed.},

ABSTRACT = {Spin–orbit coupling in nanoscale optical fields leads to the emergence of a nontrivial spin angular momentum component, transverse to the orbital momentum. In this study, we initially investigate how this spin–orbit coupling effect influences the dynamics in gold monomers. We observe that localized surface plasmon resonance induces self-generated transverse spin, affecting the trajectory of the nanoparticles as a function of the incident polarization. Furthermore, we investigate the spin–orbit coupling in gold dimers. The resonant spin momentum distribution is characterized by the unique formation of vortex and anti-vortex spin angular momentum pairs on opposite surfaces of the nanoparticles, also affecting the particle motion. These findings hold promise for various fields, particularly for the precision control in the development of plasmonic thrusters and the development of metasurfaces and other helicity-controlled system aspects. They offer a method for the development of novel systems and applications in the realm of spin optics.},

ABSTRACT = {Memristive structures are among the most promising options to be components of neuromorphic devices. However, the formation of HfO2-based devices in crossbar arrays requires considerable time since electroforming is a single stochastic operation. In this study, we investigate how Ar+ plasma immersion ion implantation (PI) affects the Pt/HfO2 (4 nm)/HfOXNY (3 nm)/TaN electroforming voltage. The advantage of PI is the simultaneous and uniform processing of the entire wafer. It is thought that Ar+ implantation causes defects to the oxide matrix, with the majority of the oxygen anions being shifted in the direction of the TaN electrode. We demonstrate that it is feasible to reduce the electroforming voltages from 7.1 V to values less than 3 V by carefully selecting the implantation energy. A considerable decrease in the electroforming voltage was achievable at an implantation energy that provided the dispersion of recoils over the whole thickness of the oxide without significantly affecting the HfOXNY/TaN interface. At the same time, Ar+ PI at higher and lower energies did not produce the same significant decrease in the electroforming voltage. It is also possible to obtain self-compliance of current in the structure during electroforming after PI with energy less than 2 keV.},

ABSTRACT = {Herein, a series of heterogeneous Fenton catalysts, Cu doped MnO2 (CDM), with different Cu/Mn molar ratios were prepared via a hydrothermal reaction. Meanwhile, detailed characterizations were used to study the structures of CDM, and it is amazing that the morphology of CDM changed from nanowires to nanoflowers with an increasing amount of Cu doped. Apart from this, both the specific surface area and oxygen vacancy increased obviously with the increasing Cu/Mn molar ratio. Then, the degradation of different dyes was utilized to evaluate the catalytic activity of different CDM with H2O2 used as the oxidizing agent, and the 50%-CDM with the highest content of Cu doped displayed the best catalytic activity. Herein, the degradation efficiency (D%) of Congo red (CR) solution with low concentration (60 mg/L) reached 100% in 3 min, while the D% of CR solution with a high concentration (300 mg/L) reached 99.4% after 5 min with a higher dosage of H2O2. Additionally, the 50%-CDM also displayed excellent reusability, for which the D% values were still higher than 90% after the 14th cycles. Based on the structure characteristics and mechanism analysis, the excellent catalytic capacity of 50%-CDM was due to the combined influence of large specific surface area and abundant oxygen vacancy. Thus, a promising heterogeneous Fenton catalyst was developed in this study, which proved the treatment efficiency of actual dye wastewater.},

ABSTRACT = {The value of two-dimensional (2D) materials in printed electronics has been gradually explored, and the rheological properties of 2D material dispersions are very different for various printing technologies. Understanding the rheological properties of 2D material dispersions plays a vital role in selecting the optimal manufacturing technology. Inkjet printing is suitable for small nanosheet sizes and low solution viscosity, and it has a significant advantage in developing nanosheet inks because of its masklessness, high efficiency, and high precision. In this work, we selected 2D Ti0.8Co0.2O2 nanosheets, which can be synthesized in large quantities by the liquid phase exfoliation technique; investigated the effects of nanosheet particle size, solution concentration on the rheological properties of the dispersion; and obtained the optimal printing processing method of the dispersion as inkjet printing. The ultrathin Ti0.8Co0.2O2 nanosheet films were prepared by inkjet printing, and their magnetic characteristics were compared with those of Ti0.8Co0.2O2 powder. The films prepared by inkjet printing exhibited long-range ordering, maintaining the nanosheet powders’ paramagnetic characteristics. Our work underscored the potential of inkjet printing as a promising method for fabricating precisely controlled thin films using 2D materials, with applications spanning electronics, sensors, and catalysis.},

ABSTRACT = {In order to prepare biomass-derived carbon materials with high specific capacitance at a low activation temperature (≤700 °C), nanoporous carbon materials were prepared from zanthoxylum bungeanum peels and seeds via the pyrolysis and KOH-activation processes. The results show that the optimal activation temperatures are 700 °C and 600 °C for peels and seeds. Benefiting from the hierarchical pore structure (micropores, mesopores, and macropores), the abundant heteroatoms (N, S, and O) containing functional groups, and plentiful electrochemical active sites, the PAC-700 and SAC-600 derive the large capacities of ~211.0 and ~219.7 F g−1 at 1.0 A g−1 in 6 M KOH within the three-electrode configuration. Furthermore, the symmetrical supercapacitors display a high energy density of 22.9 and 22.4 Wh kg−1 at 7500 W kg−1 assembled with PAC-700 and SAC-600, along with exceptional capacitance retention of 99.1% and 93.4% over 10,000 cycles at 1.0 A g−1. More significantly, the contribution here will stimulate the extensive development of low-temperature activation processes and nanoporous carbon materials for electrochemical energy storage and beyond.},

ABSTRACT = {Noble metal nanomaterials with a localized surface plasmon resonance effect exhibit outstanding advantages in areas such as photothermal therapy and photocatalysis. As a unique plasmonic metal nanostructure, gold nanobipyramids have been attracting much interest due to their strong specific local electric field intensity, large optical cross sections, and high refractive index sensitivity. In this study, we propose a novel three-component hetero-nanostructure composed of rough gold nanobipyramids (R-Au NBPs), Pt, and CdS. Initially, purified gold nanobipyramids are regrown to form R-Au NBPs that have a certain degree of roughness. These R-Au NBP substrates with a rough surface provide more hotspots and strengthen the intensity of localized electric fields. Subsequently, Pt and CdS nanoparticles are selectively deposited onto the surface of R-Au NBPs. Pt nanoparticles can provide more active sites. Each component of this hetero-nanostructure directly contacts others, creating multiple electron transfer channels. This novel design allows for tunable localized plasmon resonance wavelengths ranging from the visible to near-infrared regions. These factors contribute to the final superior photothermal conversion performance of the R-Au/Pt-CdS nanohybrids. Under the irradiation of near-infrared light (1064 nm), the photothermal conversion efficiency of R-Au/Pt-CdS reached 38.88%, which is 4.49, 1.5, and 1.22 times higher than that of Au NBPs, R-Au NBPs, and R-Au NBPs/Pt, respectively.},

ABSTRACT = {We report the temperature dependences of the dielectric function ε = ε1 + iε2 and critical point (CP) energies of the uniaxial crystal GaSe in the spectral energy region from 0.74 to 6.42 eV and at temperatures from 27 to 300 K using spectroscopic ellipsometry. The fundamental bandgap and strong exciton effect near 2.1 eV are detected only in the c-direction, which is perpendicular to the cleavage plane of the crystal. The temperature dependences of the CP energies were determined by fitting the data to the phenomenological expression that incorporates the Bose–Einstein statistical factor and the temperature coefficient to describe the electron–phonon interaction. To determine the origin of this anisotropy, we perform first-principles calculations using the mBJ method for bandgap correction. The results clearly demonstrate that the anisotropic dielectric characteristics can be directly attributed to the inherent anisotropy of p orbitals. More specifically, this prominent excitonic feature and fundamental bandgap are derived from the band-to-band transition between s and pz orbitals at the Γ-point.},

ABSTRACT = {This study investigates the encapsulation of Tenebrio molitor hydrolysate exhibiting DPP-IV inhibitory activity by spray-drying and electrospraying techniques. First, we optimized the feed formulation and processing conditions required to obtain nano-microcapsules by electrospraying when using Arabic gum as an encapsulating agent and pullulan and Tween 20 as additives. The optimum formulation was also dried by spray-drying, where the removal of the additives was also assayed. Morphology analysis reveals that electrosprayed capsules have a smaller size (1.2 ± 0.5 µm vs. 12.4 ± 8.7 µm) and greater uniformity compared to those obtained by spray-drying. Regarding the surface nitrogen content and DPP-IV inhibitory activity, our results show no significant difference between the electrosprayed capsules and spray-dried capsules containing additives (IC50 of ~1.5 mg protein/mL). Therefore, it was concluded that adding additives during spray-drying allows for a similar encapsulation efficiency and reduced degradation during processing, as achieved by electrospraying technique but providing higher productivity. On the other hand, spray-dried capsules without additives displayed a higher surface nitrogen content percentage, which was mainly due to the absence of Tween 20 in the feed formulation. Consequently, these capsules presented a higher IC50 value (IC50 of 1.99 ± 0.03 mg protein/mL) due to the potential degradation of surface-exposed peptides.},

ABSTRACT = {A rapid and accurate monitoring of hazardous formaldehyde (HCHO) gas is extremely essential for health protection. However, the high-power consumption and humidity interference still hinder the application of HCHO gas sensors. Hence, zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8)-loaded Pt-NiO/In2O3 hollow nanofibers (ZPNiIn HNFs) were designed via the electrospinning technique followed by hydrothermal treatment, aiming to enable a synergistic advantage of the surface modification and the construction of a p-n heterostructure to improve the sensing performance of the HCHO gas sensor. The ZPNiIn HNF sensor has a response value of 52.8 to 100 ppm HCHO, a nearly 4-fold enhancement over a pristine In2O3 sensor, at a moderately low temperature of 180 °C, along with rapid response/recovery speed (8/17 s) and excellent humidity tolerance. These enhanced sensing properties can be attributed to the Pt catalysts boosting the catalytic activity, the p-n heterojunctions facilitating the chemical reaction, and the appropriate ZIF-8 loading providing a hydrophobic surface. Our research presents an effective sensing material design strategy for inspiring the development of cost-effective sensors for the accurate detection of indoor HCHO hazardous gas.},

ABSTRACT = {Micro-arc oxidation (MAO) is a promising technology for enhancing the wear resistance of engine cylinders by growing a high hardness alumina ceramic film on the surface of light aluminum engine cylinders. However, the positive and negative pulse coordination, voltage characteristic signal, hardness distribution characteristics of the ceramic film, and their internal mechanism during the growth process are still unclear. This paper investigates the synergistic effect mechanism of cathodic and anodic current on the growth behaviour of alumina, dynamic voltage signal, and hardness distribution of micro-arc oxidation film. Ceramic film samples were fabricated under various conditions, including current densities of 10, 12, 14, and 16 A/dm2, and current density ratios of cathode and anode of 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3, respectively. Based on the observed characteristics of the process voltage curve and the spark signal changes, the growth of the ceramic film can be divided into five stages. The influence of positive and negative current density parameters on the segmented growth process of the ceramic film is mainly reflected in the transition time, voltage variation rate, and the voltage value of different growth stages. Enhancing the cathode pulse effect or increasing the current density level can effectively shorten the transition time and accelerate the voltage drop rate. The microhardness of the ceramic film cross-section presents a discontinuous soft-hard-soft regional distribution. Multiple thermal cycles lead to a gradient differentiation of the Al2O3 crystal phase transition ratio along the thickness direction of the layer. The layer grown on the outer surface of the initial substrate exhibits the highest hardness, with a small gradient change in hardness, forming a high hardness zone approximately 20–30 μm wide. This high hardness zone extends to both sides, with hardness decreasing rapidly.},

ABSTRACT = {The conversion of solar energy into hydrogen using photocatalysts is a pivotal solution to the ongoing energy and environmental challenges. In this study, inverse opal (IO) ZnIn2S4 (ZIS) with varying pore sizes is synthesized for the first time via a template method. The experimental results indicate that the constructed inverse opal ZnIn2S4 has a unique photonic bandgap, and its slow photon effect can enhance the interaction between light and matter, thereby improving the efficiency of light utilization. ZnIn2S4 with voids of 200 nm (ZIS–200) achieved the highest hydrogen production rate of 14.32 μ mol h−1. The normalized rate with a specific surface area is five times higher than that of the broken structures (B–ZIS), as the red edge of ZIS–200 is coupled with the intrinsic absorption edge of the ZIS. This study not only developed an approach for constructing inverse opal multi–metallic sulfides, but also provides a new strategy for enriching efficient ZnIn2S4–based photocatalysts for hydrogen evolution from water.},

ABSTRACT = {The supercritical hydrothermal synthesis of nanomaterials has gained significant attention due to its straightforward operation and the excellent performance of the resulting products. In this study, the supercritical hydrothermal method was used with Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O as the precursor and deionized water and ethanol as the solvent. Nano-ZnO was synthesized under different reaction temperatures (300~500 °C), reaction times (5~15 min), reaction pressures (22~30 MPa), precursor concentrations (0.1~0.5 mol/L), and ratios of precursor to organic solvent (C2H5OH) (2:1~1:4). The effects of synthesis conditions on the morphology and size of ZnO were studied. It was found that properly increasing hydrothermal temperature and pressure and extending the hydrothermal time are conducive to the more regular morphology and smaller size of ZnO particles, which is mainly achieved through the change of reaction conditions affecting the hydrothermal reaction rate. Moreover, the addition of ethanol makes the morphology of nano-zno more regular and significantly inhibits the agglomeration phenomenon. In addition to the change in physical properties of the solvent, this may also be related to the chemical bond established between ethanol and ZnO. The results show that the optimum synthesis conditions of ZnO are 450 °C, 26 MPa, 0.3 mol/L, 10 min, and the molar ratio of precursor to ethanol is 1:3.},

In this work, a supercritical CO2-assisted process was performed at 100 bar and 40 °C to produce niosomes at different Span 80/Tween 80 weight ratios. The formulation of cholesterol and 80:20 Span 80/Tween 80 was selected to encapsulate vancomycin, used as a model active compound, to perform a drug release rate comparison between PEGylated and non-PEGylated niosomes. In both cases, nanometric vesicles were obtained, i.e., 214 ± 59 nm and 254 ± 73 nm for non-PEGylated and PEGylated niosomes, respectively, that were characterized by a high drug encapsulation efficiency (95% for non-PEGylated and 98% for PEGylated niosomes). However, only PEGylated niosomes were able to prolong the vancomycin release time up to 20-fold with respect to untreated drug powder, resulting in a powerful strategy to control the drug release rate.},

ABSTRACT = {As one of the emerging nanomaterials, boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) provide promising opportunities for diverse applications due to their unique properties, such as high thermal conductivity, immense inertness, and high-temperature durability, while the instability of BNNTs due to their high surface induces agglomerates susceptible to the loss of their advantages. Therefore, the proper functionalization of BNNTs is crucial to highlight their fundamental characteristics. Herein, a simplistic low-cost approach of BNNT surface modification through catechol-polyamine (CAPA) interfacial polymerization is postulated to improve its dispersibility on the polymeric matrix. The modified BNNT was assimilated as a filler additive with AlN/Al2O3 filling materials in a PDMS polymeric matrix to prepare a thermal interface material (TIM). The resulting composite exhibits a heightened isotropic thermal conductivity of 8.10 W/mK, which is a ~47.27% increase compared to pristine composite 5.50 W/mK, and this can be ascribed to the improved BNNT dispersion forming interconnected phonon pathways and the thermal interface resistance reduction due to its augmented compatibility with the polymeric matrix. Moreover, the fabricated composite manifests a fire resistance improvement of ~10% in LOI relative to the neat composite sample, which can be correlated to the thermal stability shift in the TGA and DTA data. An enhancement in thermal permanence is stipulated due to a melting point (Tm) shift of ∼38.5 °C upon the integration of BNNT-CAPA. This improvement can be associated with the good distribution and adhesion of BNNT-CAPA in the polymeric matrix, integrated with its inherent thermal stability, good charring capability, and free radical scavenging effect due to the presence of CAPA on its surface. This study offers new insights into BNNT utilization and its corresponding incorporation into the polymeric matrix, which provides a prospective direction in the preparation of multifunctional materials for electric devices.},

ABSTRACT = {A novel Cr-doped BaTiO3 aerogel was successfully synthesized using a co-gelation technique that involves two metallic alkoxides and a supercritical drying method. This freshly prepared aerogel has a high specific surface area of over 100 m2/g and exhibits improved responsiveness to the simulated sunlight spectrum. Methyl orange (MO) was chosen as the simulated pollutant, and the results reveal that the Cr-doped BaTiO3 aerogel, when modified with the noble metal silver (Ag), achieves a pollutant removal rate approximately 3.2 times higher than that of the commercially available P25, reaching up to 92% within 60 min. The excellent photocatalytic performance of the Ag-modified Cr-doped BaTiO3 aerogel can be primarily attributed to its extensive specific surface area and three-dimensional porous architecture. Furthermore, the incorporation of Ag nanoparticles effectively suppresses the recombination of photo-generated electrons and holes. Stability and reusability tests have confirmed the reliability of the Ag-modified Cr-doped BaTiO3 aerogel. Therefore, this material emerges as a highly promising candidate for the treatment of textile wastewater.},

ABSTRACT = {In this study, Fe3O4/Ag magnetite-silver (MSx) nanocomposites were investigated as catalysts for advanced oxidation processes by coupling the plasmonic effect of silver nanoparticles and the ferromagnetism of iron oxide species. A surfactant-free co-precipitation synthesis method yielded pure Fe3O4 magnetite and four types of MSx nanocomposites. Their characterisation included structural, compositional, morphological and optical analyses, revealing Fe3O4 magnetite and Ag silver phases with particle sizes ranging from 15 to 40 nm, increasing with the silver content. The heterostructures with silver reduced magnetite particle aggregation, as confirmed by dynamic light scattering. The UV–Vis spectra showed that the Fe:Ag ratio strongly influenced the absorbance, with a strong absorption band around 400 nm due to the silver phase. The oxidation kinetics of organic pollutants, monitored by in situ luminescence measurements using rhodamine B as a model system, demonstrated the higher performance of the developed catalysts with increasing Ag content. The specific surface area measurements highlighted the importance of active sites in the synergistic catalytic activity of Fe3O4/Ag nanocomposites in the photo-Fenton reaction. Finally, the straightforward fabrication of diverse Fe3O4/Ag heterostructures combining magnetism and plasmonic effects opens up promising possibilities for heterogeneous catalysis and environmental remediation.},

ABSTRACT = {Rapid urbanization in many cities has produced massive amounts of problematic excavation soil. The direct disposal of untreated excavation soil often leads to significant land use and severe environmental concerns. A sustainable solution is to transform the soil waste into high-quality nano-calcined excavation soil (NCES) for application as a substitute for cement in construction. However, research in this area is very limited. This study presents a systematic investigation of the nano-sized calcined soil materials from preparation to application in cementitious material. The influence of milling parameters, including the rotational speed, milling duration, ball diameter, and milling strategy, was investigated to produce NCES with various specific surface areas. The effect of NCES substitution (15 wt% of Portland cement) in cementitious materials was then examined for mechanical performance, hydration dynamics, hydration products, and microstructure. A cement mix with very fine NCES (specific surface area of 108.76 m2/g) showed a 29.7% enhancement in mechanical strength and refined pore structure while a cement mix with un-grounded calcined soil showed a mechanical loss in comparison to the Control specimen. Delayed and reduced heat release at an early age was observed in a cement paste mixed with NCES. The underlying mechanism was investigated. The results of this work will contribute to the high-quality application of excavation soil waste.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, we designed and investigated a reduction-based method to synthesize controllably monodisperse superparamagnetic nano Fe3O4 colloidal clusters for magnetically responsive photonic crystals. It was shown that the addition of ascorbic acid (VC) to the system could synthesize monodisperse superparamagnetic nano Fe3O4 and avoided the generation of γ-Fe2O3 impurities, while the particle size and saturation magnetization intensity of nano Fe3O4 gradually decreased with the increase of VC dosage. Nano Fe3O4 could be rapidly assembled into photonic crystal dot matrix structures under a magnetic field, demonstrating tunability to various diffraction wavelengths. The nano Fe3O4 modified by polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and silicon coated could be stably dispersed in a variety of organic solvents and thus diffracted different wavelengths under a magnetic field. This is expected to be applied in various scenarios in the field of optical color development.},

ABSTRACT = {The application of electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) for renewable energy conversion contributes to the ultimate goal of a zero-carbon emission society. Metal phosphides have been considered as promising HER catalysts in the alkaline environment, which, unfortunately, is still limited owing to the weak adsorption of H* and easy dissolution during operation. Herein, a bimetallic NiCoP-2/NF phosphide is constructed on nickel foam (NF), requiring rather low overpotentials of 150 mV and 169 mV to meet the current densities of 500 and 1000 mA cm−2, respectively, and able to operate stably for 100 h without detectable activity decay. The excellent HER performance is obtained thanks to the synergetic catalytic effect between Ni and Co, among which Ni is introduced to enhance the intrinsic activity and Co increases the electrochemically active area. Meanwhile, the protection of the externally generated amorphous phosphorus oxide layer improves the stability of NiCoP/NF. An electrolyser using NiCoP-2/NF as both cathode and anode catalysts in an alkaline solution can produce hydrogen with low electric consumption (overpotential of 270 mV at 500 mA cm−2).},

ABSTRACT = {The presented study is concerned with a new multi-step method to synthesize PtCo/C materials based on composite CoxOy/C that combines the advantages of different liquid-phase synthesis methods. Based on the results of studying the materials at each stage of synthesis with the TG, XRD, TEM, SEI, TXRF, CV and LSV methods, a detailed overview of the sequential changes in catalyst composition and structure at each stage of the synthesis is presented. The PtCo/C catalyst synthesized with the multi-step method is characterized by a uniform distribution of bimetallic nanoparticles of about 3 nm in size over the surface of the support, which result in its high ESA and ORR activity. The activity study for the synthesized PtCo/C catalyst in an MEA showed better current–voltage characteristics and a higher maximum specific power compared with an MEA based on a commercial Pt/C catalyst. Therefore, the results of the presented study demonstrate high prospects for the developed approach to the multi-step synthesis of PtM/C catalysts, which may enhance the characteristics of proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs).},

The presence of aminophenylsulfonic derivatives is essential for the reduction procedure and in parallel leads to the enrichment of the graphene surface with aminophenylsulfonic groups that provide a high hydrophilicity to the final materials/pigments.},

ABSTRACT = {Contamination by pharmaceuticals adversely affects the quality of natural water, causing environmental and health concerns. In this study, target drugs (oxazepam, OZ, 17-α-ethinylestradiol, EE2, and drospirenone, DRO), which have been extensively detected in the effluents of WWTPs over the past decades, were selected. We report here a new photoactive system, operating under visible light, capable of degrading EE2, OZ and DRO in water. The photocatalytic system comprised glass spheres coated with nanostructured, solvothermally treated WO3 that improves the ease of handling of the photocatalyst and allows for the implementation of a continuous flow process. The photocatalytic system based on solvothermal WO3 shows much better results in terms of photocurrent generation and photocatalyst stability with respect to state-of-the-art WO3 nanoparticles. Results herein obtained demonstrate that the proposed flow system is a promising prototype for enhanced contaminant degradation exploiting advanced oxidation processes.},

ABSTRACT = {Batch and transport experiments were used to investigate the remediation of loamy sand soil contaminated with Cr(VI) using zero-valent iron nanoparticles (nZVI) stabilized by carboxymethylcellulose (CMC-nZVI). The effect of pH, ionic strength (IS), and flow rate on the removal efficiency of Cr(VI) were investigated under equilibrium (uniform transport) and non-equilibrium (two-site sorption) transport using the Hydrus-1D model. The overall removal efficiency ranged from 70 to over 90% based on the chemical characteristics of the CMC-nZVI suspension and the transport conditions. The concentration and pH of the CMC-nZVI suspension had the most significant effect on the removal efficiency and transport of Cr(VI) in the soil. The average removal efficiency of Cr(VI) was increased from 24.1 to 75.5% when the concentration of CMC-nZVI nanoparticles was increased from 10 to 250 mg L−1, mainly because of the increased total surface area at a larger particle concentration. Batch experiments showed that the removal efficiency of Cr(VI) was much larger under acidic conditions. The average removal efficiency of Cr(VI) reached 90.1 and 60.5% at pH 5 and 7, respectively. The two-site sorption model described (r2 = 0.96–0.98) the transport of Cr(VI) in soil quite well as compared to the uniform transport model (r2 = 0.81–0.98). The average retardation of Cr(VI) was 3.51 and 1.61 at pH 5 and 7, respectively, indicating earlier arrival for the breakthrough curves and a shorter time to reach maximum relative concentration at lower pH. The methodology presented in this study, combining column experiment and modeling transport using the Hydrus-1D model, successfully assessed the removal of Cr(VI) from polluted soils, offering innovative, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly remediation methodologies.},

ABSTRACT = {ZnO nanostructures show great potential in hydrogen sensing at atmospheric conditions for good gas adsorption abilities. However, there is less research on low-pressure hydrogen sensing performance due to its low concentration and in-homogeneous distributions under low-pressure environments. Here, we report the low-pressure hydrogen sensing by the construction of Al–N-co-doped ZnO nanorods based on the adsorption-induced field emission enhancement effect in the pressure range of 10−7 to 10−3 Pa. The investigation indicates that the Al–N-co-doped ZnO sample is the most sensitive to low-pressure hydrogen sensing among all ZnO samples, with the highest sensing current increase of 140% for 5 min emission. In addition, the increased amplitude of sensing current for the Al–N-co-doped ZnO sample could reach 75% at the pressure 7 × 10−3 Pa for 1 min emission. This work not only expands the hydrogen sensing applications to the co-doped ZnO nanomaterials, but also provides a promising approach to develop field emission cathodes with strong low-pressure hydrogen sensing effect.},

ABSTRACT = {Chemotherapy is one of the most commonly used methods for treating cancer, but its side effects severely limit its application and impair treatment effectiveness. Removing off-target chemotherapy drugs from the serum promptly through adsorption is the most direct approach to minimize their side effects. In this study, we synthesized a series of adsorption materials to remove the chemotherapy drug doxorubicin by modifying MOF nanosheets with sulfonated azocalix[4]arenes. The strong affinity of sulfonated azocalix[4]arenes for doxorubicin results in high adsorption strength (Langmuir adsorption constant = 2.45–5.73 L mg−1) and more complete removal of the drug. The extensive external surface area of the 2D nanosheets facilitates the exposure of a large number of accessible adsorption sites, which capture DOX molecules without internal diffusion, leading to a high adsorption rate (pseudo-second-order rate constant = 0.0058–0.0065 g mg−1 min−1). These adsorbents perform effectively in physiological environments and exhibit low cytotoxicity and good hemocompatibility. These features make them suitable for removing doxorubicin from serum during “drug capture” procedures. The optimal adsorbent can remove 91% of the clinical concentration of doxorubicin within 5 min.},

ABSTRACT = {In the evolving landscape of portable electronics, there is a critical demand for components that meld stretchability with optical transparency, especially in supercapacitors. Traditional materials fall short in harmonizing conductivity, stretchability, transparency, and capacity. Although poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) stands out as an exemplary candidate, further performance enhancements are necessary to meet the demands of practical applications. This study presents an innovative and effective method for enhancing electrochemical properties by homogeneously incorporating Ru(III) into PEDOT:PSS. These Ru(III) PEDOT:PSS complexes are readily synthesized by dipping PEDOT:PSS films in RuCl3 solution for no longer than one minute, leveraging the high specific capacitance of Ru(III) while minimizing interference with transmittance. The supercapacitor made with this Ru(III) PEDOT:PSS complex demonstrated an areal capacitance of 1.62 mF cm−2 at a transmittance of 73.5%, which was 155% higher than that of the supercapacitor made with PEDOT:PSS under comparable transparency. Notably, the supercapacitor retained 87.8% of its initial capacitance even under 20% tensile strain across 20,000 cycles. This work presents a blueprint for developing stretchable and transparent supercapacitors, marking a significant stride toward next-generation wearable electronics.},

ABSTRACT = {Gastric perforation refers to the complete rupture of the gastric wall, leading to the extravasation of gastric contents into the thoracic cavity or peritoneum. Without timely intervention, the expulsion of gastric contents may culminate in profound discomfort, exacerbating the inflammatory process and potentially triggering perilous sepsis. In clinical practice, surgical suturing or endoscopic closure procedures are commonly employed. Magnetic-driven microswarms have also been employed for sealing gastrointestinal perforation. However, surgical intervention entails significant risk of bleeding, while endoscopic closure poses risks of inadequate closure and the need for subsequent removal of closure clips. Moreover, the efficacy of microswarms is limited as they merely adhere to the perforated area, and their sealing effect diminishes upon removal of the magnetic field. Herein, we present a Fe&Mg@Lard-Paraffin micromotor (LPM) constructed from a mixture of lard and paraffin coated with magnesium (Mg) microspheres and iron (Fe) nanospheres for sutureless sealing gastric perforations. Under the control of a rotating magnetic field, this micromotor demonstrates precise control over its movement on gastric mucosal folds and accurately targets the gastric perforation area. The phase transition induced by the high-frequency magnetothermal effect causes the micromotor composed of a mixed oil phase of lard and paraffin to change from a solid to a liquid phase. The coated Mg microspheres are subsequently exposed to the acidic gastric acid environment to produce a magnesium protonation reaction, which in turn generates hydrogen (H2) bubble recoil. Through a Mg-based micropower traction, part of the oil phase could be pushed into the gastric perforation, and it would then solidify to seal the gastric perforation area. Experimental results show that this can achieve long-term (>2 h) gastric perforation sealing. This innovative approach holds potential for improving outcomes in gastric perforation management.},

ABSTRACT = {Two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals layered materials have been explored in depth.

Here, we report a selective two-step growth method for high-quality single crystalline CrTe/WSe2 and CrTe/MoS2 heterostructures by adopting a universal CVD strategy with the assistance of molten salt and mass control. Quasi-2D metallic CrTe was grown on pre-deposited 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDC) under relatively low temperatures. A 2D CrTe/TMDC heterostructure was established to explore the interface’s structure using scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), and also demonstrate ferromagnetism in a metal–semiconductor CrTe/TMDC heterostructure.},

ABSTRACT = {Nanocrystalline carbonyl iron (CI) particles are promising microwave absorbents at elevated temperature, whereas their excessive grain boundary energy leads to the growth of nanograins and a deterioration in permeability. In this work, we report a strategy to enhance the thermal stability of the grains and microwave absorption of CI particles by doping a SiBaFe alloy. Grain growth was effectively inhibited by the pinning effect of SiBaFe alloy nanoparticles at the grain boundaries. After heat treatment at 600 °C, the grain size of CI particles increased from ~10 nm to 85.1 nm, while that of CI/SiBaFe particles was only 32.0 nm; with the temperature rising to 700 °C, the grain size of CI particles sharply increased to 158.1 nm, while that of CI/SiBaFe particles was only 40.8 nm. Excellent stability in saturation magnetization and microwave absorption was also achieved in CI/SiBaFe particles. After heat treatment at 600 °C, the flaky CI/SiBaFe particles exhibited reflection loss below −10 dB over 7.01~10.11 GHz and a minimum of −14.92 dB when the thickness of their paraffin-based composite was 1.5 mm. We provided a low-cost and efficient kinetic strategy to stabilize the grain size in nanoscale and microwave absorption for nanocrystalline magnetic absorbents working at elevated temperature.},

ABSTRACT = {A novel and promising way for creating nanomaterials based on gallium oxide is the ion synthesis of Ga2O3 nanocrystals in a SiO2/Si dielectric matrix. The properties of nanocrystals are determined by the conditions of ion synthesis—the parameters of ion irradiation and post-implantation heat treatment. In this work, the light-emitting properties of Ga2O3 nanocrystals were studied depending on the temperature and annealing atmosphere. It was found that annealing at a temperature of 900 °C leads to the appearance of intense luminescence with a maximum at ~480 nm caused by the recombination of donor–acceptor pairs. An increase in luminescence intensity upon annealing in an oxidizing atmosphere is shown. Based on data from photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, a hypothesis about the possibility of the participation of a quantum-size effect during radiative recombination is proposed. A mechanism for the formation of Ga2O3 nanocrystals during ion synthesis is suggested, which makes it possible to describe the change in the luminescent properties of the synthesized samples with varying conditions of post-implantation heat treatment.},

ABSTRACT = {In this study, we investigate micrometer-sized NaYF4 crystals double-doped with Yb3+/Er3+ lanthanide ions, designed for temperature-sensing applications. In contrast to previous studies, which focused predominantly on the high-temperature regime, our investigation spans a comprehensive range of both high and ultralow temperatures. We explore the relationship between temperature and the upconversion luminescence (UCL) spectra in both frequency and time domains. Our findings highlight the strong dependence of these spectral characteristics of lanthanide-doped NaYF4 crystals on temperature. Furthermore, we introduce a dual-mode luminescence temperature measurement technique, leveraging the upconversion emission intensity ratio for both green and red emissions. This study also examines the correlation between temperature sensing, energy level disparities, and thermal coupling in Er3+ ions across various temperature scales. Our research contributes to advancing the understanding and application of lanthanide-doped materials, setting a foundation for future innovations in temperature sensing across diverse fields.},

ABSTRACT = {In our pursuit of high-power terahertz (THz) wave generation, we propose innovative edge-terminated single-drift region (SDR) multi-quantum well (MQW) impact avalanche transit time (IMPATT) structures based on the AlxGa1−xN/GaN/AlxGa1−xN material system, with a fixed aluminum mole fraction of x = 0.3. Two distinct MQW diode configurations, namely p+-n junction-based and Schottky barrier diode structures, were investigated for their THz potential. To enhance reverse breakdown characteristics, we propose employing mesa etching and nitrogen ion implantation for edge termination, mitigating issues related to premature and soft breakdown. The THz performance is comprehensively evaluated through steady-state and high-frequency characterizations using a self-consistent quantum drift-diffusion (SCQDD) model. Our proposed Al0.3Ga0.7N/GaN/Al0.3Ga0.7N MQW diodes, as well as GaN-based single-drift region (SDR) and 3C-SiC/Si/3C-SiC MQW-based double-drift region (DDR) IMPATT diodes, are simulated. The Schottky barrier in the proposed diodes significantly reduces device series resistance, enhancing peak continuous wave power output to approximately 300 mW and DC to THz conversion efficiency to nearly 13% at 1.0 THz. Noise performance analysis reveals that MQW structures within the avalanche zone mitigate noise and improve overall performance. Benchmarking against state-of-the-art THz sources establishes the superiority of our proposed THz sources, highlighting their potential for advancing THz technology and its applications.},

ABSTRACT = {Seeing the atomic configuration of single organic nanoparticles at a sub-Å spatial resolution by transmission electron microscopy has been so far prevented by the high sensitivity of soft matter to radiation damage. This difficulty is related to the need to irradiate the particle with a total dose of a few electrons/Å2, not compatible with the electron beam density necessary to search the low-contrast nanoparticle, to control its drift, finely adjust the electron-optical conditions and particle orientation, and finally acquire an effective atomic-resolution image. On the other hand, the capability to study individual pristine nanoparticles, such as proteins, active pharmaceutical ingredients, and polymers, with peculiar sensitivity to the variation in the local structure, defects, and strain, would provide advancements in many fields, including materials science, medicine, biology, and pharmacology. Here, we report the direct sub-ångström-resolution imaging at room temperature of pristine unstained crystalline polymer-based nanoparticles. This result is obtained by combining low-dose in-line electron holography and phase-contrast imaging on state-of-the-art equipment, providing an effective tool for the quantitative sub-ångström imaging of soft matter.},

ABSTRACT = {Atomic force microscopy (AFM) is a technique that relies on detecting forces at the nanonewton scale. It involves using a cantilever with a tiny tip at one end. This tip interacts with the short- and long-range forces of material surfaces. These cantilevers are typically manufactured with Si or Si3N4 and synthesized using a lithography technique, which implies a high cost. On the other hand, through simple chemical methods, it is possible to synthesize a magneto-dielectric composite made up of artificial SiO2 opals infiltrated with superparamagnetic nanoparticles of Fe3O4. From these materials, it is possible to obtain tipless cantilevers that can be used in AFM analysis. Tipless cantilevers are an alternative tool in nanoscale exploration, offering a versatile approach to surface analysis. Unlike traditional AFM probes, tipless versions eliminate the challenges associated with tip wear, ensuring prolonged stability during measurements. This makes tipless AFM particularly valuable for imaging delicate or soft samples, as it prevents sample damage and provides precise measurements of topography and mechanical and electromechanical properties. This study presents the results of the characterization of known surfaces using magneto-dielectric cantilevers and commercial cantilevers based on Si. The characterization will be carried out through contact and non-contact topography measurements.},

ABSTRACT = {Raman spectroscopy plays a pivotal role in spectroscopic investigations. The small Raman scattering cross-section of numerous analytes, however, requires enhancement of the signal through specific structuring of the electromagnetic and morphological properties of the underlying surface. This enhancement technique is known as surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). Despite the existence of various proposed alternatives, the approach involving Fabry–Pérot cavities, which constitutes a straightforward method to enhance the electromagnetic field around the analyte, has not been extensively utilized. This is because, for the analyte to experience the maximum electric field, it needs to be embedded within the cavity. Consequently, the top mirror of the cavity will eventually shield it from the external laser source. Recently, an open-cavity configuration has been demonstrated to exhibit properties similar to the classic Fabry–Pérot configuration, with the added advantage of maintaining direct accessibility for the laser source. This paper showcases how such a simple yet innovative configuration can be effectively utilized to achieve remarkable Raman enhancement. The simple structure, coupled with its inexpensive nature and versatility in material selection and scalability, makes it an ideal choice for various analytes and integration into diverse Raman apparatus setups.},

ABSTRACT = {Bioaccessibility of metals from substances and alloys is increasingly used as part of the assessment to predict potential toxicity. However, data are sparse on the metal bioaccessibility from nanoparticle (NP) size metal substances. This study examines nickel ion release from metallic nickel and nickel oxide micron particles (MPs) and NPs in simulated biological fluids at various timepoints including those relevant for specific routes of exposure. The results suggest that MPs of both metallic nickel and nickel oxide generally released more nickel ions in acidic simulated biological fluids (gastric and lysosomal) than NPs of the same substance, with the largest differences being for nickel oxide. In more neutral pH fluids (interstitial and perspiration), nickel metal NPs released more nickel ions than MPs, with nickel oxide results showing a higher release for MPs in interstitial fluid yet a lower release in perspiration fluid. Various experimental factors related to the particle, fluid, and extraction duration were identified that can have an impact on the particle dissolution and release of nickel ions. Overall, the results suggest that based on nickel release alone, nickel NPs are not inherently more hazardous than nickel MPs. Moreover, analyses should be performed on a case-by-case basis with consideration of various experimental factors and correlation with in vivo data.},

ABSTRACT = {Porous metallic nanomaterials exhibit interesting physical and chemical properties, and are widely used in various fields. Traditional fabrication techniques are limited to metallurgy, sintering, electrodeposition, etc., which limit the control of pore size and distribution, and make it difficult to achieve materials with high surface areas. On the other hand, the chemical preparation of metallic nanoparticles is usually carried out with strong reducing agents or at high temperature, resulting in the formation of dispersed particles which cannot evolve into porous metal. In this study, we reported the simple fabrication of coral-like mesoporous Pd nanomaterial (Pd NC) with a ligament size of 4.1 nm. The fabrication was carried out by simple solvothermal reduction at a mild temperature of 135 °C, without using any templates. The control experiments suggested that tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBAB) played a critical role in the Pd(II) reduction into Pd nanoclusters and their subsequent aggregation to form Pd NC, and another key point for the formation of Pd NC is not to use a strong reducing agent. In alkaline water electrolysis, the Pd NC outperforms the monodisperse Pd NPs and the state-of-the-art Pt (under large potentials) for H2 evolution reaction, probably due to its mesoporous structure and large surface area. This work reports a simple and novel method for producing porous metallic nanomaterials with a high utilization efficiency of metal atoms, and it is expected to contribute to the practical preparation of porous metallic nanomaterials by solvothermal reductions.},

ABSTRACT = {Diffraction gratings have always been used to effectively couple optical radiation within integrated waveguides. This is also valid for plasmonic structures that support Surface Plasmon Polariton (SPP) waves. Traditional gratings usually excite SPP waves at the interface where they are located or, for thin metal nanostrips, at both interfaces. But reducing the thickness of the metal layer in the presence of a grating has the handicap of increasing the tunnelling of light towards the substrate, which means higher losses and reduced coupling efficiency. In this paper, we design and optimize novel gratings buried within the metallic thin films for selective coupling of SPP waves onto individual interfaces. Compared with traditional superficial gratings, the novel buried ones demonstrate higher efficiency and much lower residual tunnelling of light through the coupling structures.},

ABSTRACT = {In the field of wearable thermoelectric generators, graphene-based materials have attracted attention as suitable candidates due to their low material costs and tunable electronic properties. However, their high thermal conductivity poses significant challenges. Low thermal conductivity due to porous structure of the laser-induced graphene, combined with its affordability and scalability, positions it as a promising candidate for thermoelectric applications. In this study, thermoelectric properties of the laser-induced graphene (LIG) on polyimide and their dependence on structural modifications of LIG were investigated. Furthermore, it was shown that increasing the laser scribing power on polyimide results in larger graphene flakes and a higher degree of graphitization. Electrical conductivity measurements indicated an increase with increasing laser power, due to a higher degree of graphitization, which enhances charge carrier mobility. Our findings reveal that LIG exhibits p-type semiconducting behavior, characterized by a positive Seebeck coefficient. It was shown that increasing laser power increased the Seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity simultaneously, which is attributed to a charge carrier energy filtering effect arising from structures occurred on the graphene flakes. Moreover, the porous structure of LIG contributes to its relatively low thermal conductivity, ranging between 0.6 W/m·K and 0.85 W/m·K, which enhances the thermoelectric performance of LIG. It has been observed that with increasing laser power, the figure of merit for laser-induced graphene can be enhanced by nearly 10 times, which holds promising applications for laser-induced graphene due to the tunability of its thermoelectric performance by changing laser parameters.},

ABSTRACT = {This study involved direct doping of In2O3 into silicon carbide (SiC) powder, resulting in 8.0 at% In-doped SiC powder. Subsequently, heating at 500 °C was performed to form a target, followed by the utilization of electron beam (e-beam) technology to deposit the In-doped SiC thin films with the thickness of approximately 189.8 nm. The first breakthrough of this research was the successful deposition of using e-beam technology. The second breakthrough involved utilizing various tools to analyze the physical and electrical properties of In-doped SiC thin films. Hall effect measurement was used to measure the resistivity, mobility, and carrier concentration and confirm its n-type semiconductor nature. The uniform dispersion of In ions in SiC was as confirmed by electron microscopy energy-dispersive spectroscopy and secondary ion mass spectrometry analyses. The Tauc Plot method was employed to determine the Eg values of pure SiC and In-doped SiC thin films. Semiconductor parameter analyzer was used to measure the conductivity and the I-V characteristics of devices in In-doped SiC thin films. Furthermore, the third finding demonstrated that In2O3-doped SiC thin films exhibited remarkable current density. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Gaussian-resolved spectra further confirmed a significant relationship between conductivity and oxygen vacancy concentration. Lastly, depositing these In-doped SiC thin films onto p-type silicon substrates etched with buffered oxide etchant resulted in the formation of heterojunction p-n junction. This junction exhibited the rectifying characteristics of a diode, with sample current values in the vicinity of 102 mA, breakdown voltage at approximately −5.23 V, and open-circuit voltage around 1.56 V. This underscores the potential of In-doped SiC thin films for various semiconductor devices.},

ABSTRACT = {Glass ceramics (GCs) containing PbS quantum dots (QDs) are prepared for temperature sensing. Broadband emissions are detected in the GCs when PbS QDs are precipitated from the glasses, and emissions centers are modulated from 1250 nm to 1960 nm via heat treatments. The emission centers of GCs exhibit blue-shifts when environment temperatures increase from room temperature to 210 °C. Importantly, the shift values of emission centers increase linearly with the test temperature, which is beneficial for applications in temperature sensing. A temperature sensor based on PbS QDs GC is heat-treated at 500 °C for 10 h, possesses the highest sensitivity of 0.378 nm/°C, and exhibits excellent stability and repeatability at high temperatures (up to 210 °C). Moreover, GC fibers are fabricated by using the GCs as the fiber core. The sensitivity of the temperature-sensing sensor of the GC fibers is also demonstrated and the sensitivity is as high as 0.558 nm/°C. The designed PbS QDs GCs provide a significant materials base for the manufacturing of fluorescent temperature sensors and the GC fibers offer significant opportunities for temperature detection in complex, integrated and compact devices.},

ABSTRACT = {The development of fluorescent materials that can act as sensors for the determination of metal ions in biological fluids is important since they show, among others, high sensitivity and specificity. However, most of the molecules that are used for these purposes possess a very low solubility in aqueous media, and, thus, it is necessary to adopt some derivation strategies. Clay minerals, for example, hectorite, as natural materials, are biocompatible and available in large amounts at a very low cost that have been extensively used as carrier systems for the delivery of different hydrophobic species. In the present work, we report the synthesis and characterization of a hectorite/phenanthroline nanomaterial as a potential fluorescent sensor for Zn ion detection in water. The interaction of phenanthroline with the Ht interlaminar space was thoroughly investigated, via both theoretical and experimental studies (i.e., thermogravimetry, FT-IR, UV-vis and fluorescence spectroscopies and XRD measurements), while its morphology was imaged by scanning electron microscopy. Afterwards, the possibility to use it as sensor for the detection of Zn2+ ions, in comparison to other metal ions, was investigated through fluorescent measurements, and the stability of the solid Ht/Phe/Zn complex was assessed by different experimental and theoretical measurements.},

ABSTRACT = {Prohibited additives in infant formula severely affect the health of infants. Terahertz (THz) spectroscopy has enormous application potential in analyte detection due to its rich fingerprint information content. However, there is limited research on the mixtures of multiple analytes. In this study, we propose a split ring metasurface that supports magnetic dipole bound states in the continuum (BIC). By breaking the symmetry, quasi-BIC with a high quality (Q) factor can be generated. Utilizing an angle-scanning strategy, the frequency of the resonance dip can be shifted, resulting in the plotting of an envelope curve which can reflect the molecular fingerprint of the analytes. Two prohibited additives found in infant formula, melamine and vanillin, can be identified in different proportions. Furthermore, a metric similar to the resolution in chromatographic analysis is introduced and calculated to be 0.61, indicating that these two additives can be detected simultaneously. Our research provides a new solution for detecting additives in infant formula.},

ABSTRACT = {The combination of higher-order topological insulators and valley photonic crystals has recently aroused extensive attentions due to the great potential in flexible and efficient optical field manipulations. Here, we computationally propose a photonic device for the 1550 nm communication band, in which the topologically protected electromagnetic modes with high quality can be selectively triggered and modulated on demand. Through introducing two valley photonic crystal units without any structural alteration, we successfully achieve multi-dimensional coupled topological states thanks to the diverse electromagnetic characteristics of two valley edge states. According to the simulations, the constructed topological photonic devices can realize Fano lines on the spectrum and show high-quality localized modes by tuning the coupling strength between the zero-dimensional valley corner states and the one-dimensional valley edge states. Furthermore, we extend the valley-locked properties of edge states to higher-order valley topological insulators, where the selected corner states can be directionally excited by chiral source. More interestingly, we find that the modulation of multi-dimensional coupled photonic topological states with pseudospin dependence become more efficient compared with those uncoupled modes. This work presents a valuable approach for multi-dimensional optical field manipulation, which may support potential applications in on-chip integrated nanophotonic devices.},

ABSTRACT = {Two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (2D-TMDs) possess appropriate bandgaps and interact via van der Waals (vdW) forces between layers, effectively overcoming lattice compatibility challenges inherent in traditional heterojunctions. This property facilitates the creation of heterojunctions with customizable bandgap alignments. However, the prevailing method for creating heterojunctions with 2D-TMDs relies on the low-efficiency technique of mechanical exfoliation. Sb2Te3, recognized as a notable p-type semiconductor, emerges as a versatile component for constructing diverse vertical p–n heterostructures with 2D-TMDs. This study presents the successful large-scale deposition of 2D Sb2Te3 onto inert mica substrates, providing valuable insights into the integration of Sb2Te3 with 2D-TMDs to form heterostructures. Building upon this initial advancement, a precise epitaxial growth method for Sb2Te3 on pre-existing WS2 surfaces on SiO2/Si substrates is achieved through a two-step chemical vapor deposition process, resulting in the formation of Sb2Te3/WS2 heterojunctions. Finally, the development of 2D Sb2Te3/WS2 optoelectronic devices is accomplished, showing rapid response times, with a rise/decay time of 305 μs/503 μs, respectively.},

ABSTRACT = {Ti3C2Tx MXene, as a common two-dimensional material, has a wide range of applications in electrochemical energy storage. However, the surface forces of few-layer or monolayer Ti3C2Tx MXene lead to easy agglomeration, which hinders the demonstration of its performance due to the characteristics of layered materials. Herein, we report a facile method for preparing monolayer Ti3C2Tx MXene on nickel foam to achieve a self-supporting structure for supercapacitor electrodes under high electrostatic fields. Moreover, the specific capacitance varies with the deposition of different-concentration monolayer Ti3C2Tx MXene on nickel foam. As a result, Ti3C2Tx/NF has a high specific capacitance of 319 mF cm−2 at 2 mA cm−2 and an excellent long-term cycling stability of 94.4% after 7000 cycles. It was observed that the areal specific capacitance increases, whereas the mass specific capacitance decreases with the increasing loading mass. Attributable to the effect of the high electrostatic field, the self-supporting structure of the Ti3C2Tx/NF becomes denser as the concentration of the monolayer Ti3C2Tx MXene ink increases, ultimately affecting its electrochemical performance. This work provides a simple way to overcome the agglomeration problem of few-layer or monolayer MXene, then form a self-supporting electrode exhibiting excellent electrochemical performance.},

ABSTRACT = {The exploration of catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with high activity and acceptable price is essential for water splitting to hydrogen generation. High-entropy materials (HEMs) have aroused increasing interest in the field of electrocatalysis due to their unusual physicochemical properties. In this work, we reported a novel FeCoNiMoZn-OH high entropy hydroxide (HEH)/nickel foam (NF) synthesized by a facile pulsed electrochemical deposition method at room temperature. The FeCoNiMoZn-OH HEH displays a 3D porous nanosheet morphology and polycrystalline structure, which exhibits extraordinary OER activity in alkaline media, including much lower overpotential (248 mV at 10 mA cm−2) and Tafel slope (30 mV dec−1). Furthermore, FeCoNiMoZn-OH HEH demonstrates excellent OER catalytic stability. The enhanced catalytic performance of the FeCoNiMoZn-OH HEH primarily contributed to the porous morphology and the positive synergistic effect between Mo and Zn. This work provides a novel insight into the design of HEMs in catalytic application.},

ABSTRACT = {In the production of cement, raw materials can be partially substituted by regenerable waste provided from glasses, construction and demolition waste in order to reduce the environmental problem and burden of landfills. In this study, limestone–silicate composites were synthesized using starting materials such as glass waste and lime, brick, autoclaved aerated concrete (ACC), mortar or plaster waste. The structure and mechanical properties of the nano-composite materials have been studied. The mean CaCO3 crystallite sizes are higher for composites containing ACC and brick than for doping with lime, mortar and plaster. Cement-based materials are formed by replacing 2.5% of the Portland cement with limestone–silicate composites. The results indicate new possibilities for introducing 2.5%of composites in cement paste because they promote the formation of the C-S-H network, which provides strength and long stability for the cement paste. The influence of varied types of mix composites in the expired cement on the initial cracking strain and stress, tensile strength and compressive strength were investigated. The compressive strength values of composite-expired cement specimens are situated between 11.8 and 15.7 MPa, respectively, which reflect an increase from 22.9 up to 63.54% over the compressive strength of expired cement matrix.},

ABSTRACT = {A narrow energy distribution is a prominent characteristic of field-emission cold cathodes. When applied in a vacuum electronic device, the cold cathode is fabricated over a large area and works under a high current and current density. It is interesting to see the energy distribution of the field emitter under such a working situation. In this work, the energy distribution spectra of a single carbon nanotube (CNT) and a CNT film were investigated across a range of currents, spanning from low to high. A consistent result indicated that, at low current emission, the CNT film (area: 0.585 mm2) exhibited a narrow electron energy distribution as small as 0.5 eV, similar to that of a single CNT, while the energy distribution broadened with increased current and voltage, accompanied by a peak position shift. The influencing factors related to the electric field, Joule heating, Coulomb interaction, and emission site over a large area were discussed to elucidate the underlying mechanism. The results provide guidance for the electron source application of nano-materials in cold cathode devices.},

ABSTRACT = {This study aimed to evaluate the influence of denture cleansers on the color, stability, and surface roughness of three-dimensional (3D)-printed denture base resins modified with zirconium dioxide nanoparticles (nano-ZrO2). A total of 440 specimens were fabricated using one heat-polymerized resin, and two 3D-printed resins (NextDent and ASIGA). According to the nano-ZrO2 content, the specimens for each resin were divided into five groups (0%, 0.5%wt, 1%wt, 3%wt, and 5%wt). Each concentration was divided into four subgroups (n = 10) based on the immersion solution (distilled water, sodium hypochlorite, Corega, and Fittydent) and immersion duration (360 and 720 days). The color changes (∆E00) and surface roughness (Ra, µm) of each specimen were measured at different time intervals (base line, 360 days, 720 days) using a spectrophotometer and a non-contact profilometer, respectively. The results were statistically analyzed using ANOVA and a post hoc Tukey’s test (α = 0.05). Sodium hypochlorite showed the highest significant color change of all the denture base resins (p < 0.001). The average value of ΔE00 for sodium hypochlorite was significantly higher than the values for the other solutions (Fittydent, Corega, and water) (p < 0.001). Color stability was significantly affected by immersion time for all types of solutions except Corega (p < 0.001). All of the tested immersion solutions (distilled water, sodium hypochlorite, Corega, and Fittydent) showed a significant increase in the surface roughness of all the denture base resins (p < 0.05). Surface roughness was substantially increased by immersion time for all types of solution except Fittydent (p < 0.001). Denture cleansers can result in substantial color change and affect the surface roughness of unmodified and nanoparticle-modified denture base resins. Therefore, the selection of denture cleanser and appropriate types of material is critical for denture longevity.},

ABSTRACT = {Inflammation and oxidative stress are implicated in the pathogenesis of Crohn’s disease. Cerium oxide nanoparticle (CNP) conjugated to microRNA 146a (miR146a) (CNP-miR146a) is a novel compound with anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties. We hypothesized that local administration of CNP-miR146a would improve colitis in a 2,4,6-Trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) mouse model for Crohn’s disease by decreasing colonic inflammation. Balb/c mice were instilled with TNBS enemas to induce colitis. Two days later, the mice received cellulose gel enema, cellulose gel with CNP-miR146a enema, or no treatment. Control mice received initial enemas of 50% ethanol and PBS enemas on day two. The mice were monitored daily for weight loss and clinical disease activity. The mice were euthanized on days two or five to evaluate their miR146a expression, inflammation on histology, and colonic IL-6 and TNF gene expressions and protein concentrations. CNP-miR146a enema successfully increased colonic miR146a expression at 12 h following delivery. At the end of five days from TNBS instillation, the mice treated with CNP-miR146a demonstrated reduced weight loss, improved inflammation scores on histology, and reduced gene expressions and protein concentrations of IL-6 and TNF. The local delivery of CNP-miR146a in a TNBS mouse model of acute Crohn’s colitis dramatically decreased inflammatory signaling, resulting in improved clinical disease.},

ABSTRACT = {Metal nanoparticle phytosynthesis has become, in recent decades, one of the most promising alternatives for the development of nanomaterials using “green chemistry” methods. The present work describes, for the first time in the literature, the phytosynthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) using extracts obtained by two methods using the aerial parts of Marrubium vulgare L. The extracts (obtained by classical temperature extraction and microwave-assisted extraction) were characterized in terms of total phenolics content and by HPLC analysis, while the phytosynthesis process was confirmed using X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy, the results suggesting that the classical method led to the obtaining of smaller-dimension AgNPs (average diameter under 15 nm by TEM). In terms of biological properties, the study confirmed that AgNPs as well as the M. vulgare crude extracts reduced the viability of human gingival fibroblasts in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, with microwave-assisted extracts having the more pronounced effects. Additionally, the study unveiled that AgNPs transiently increased nitric oxide levels which then decreased over time, thus offering valuable insights into their potential therapeutic use and safety profile.},

The characterization of the TM-CN and the C-TM-CN was conducted via X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR) to ascertain the successful modification. The organic dye degradation experiments demonstrated that introducing an appropriate amount of Ti3C2 MXene resulted in the complete degradation of RhB within 60 min, three times the photocatalytic efficiency of a pure g-C3N4. The C-TM-CN exhibited the stable and outstanding photocatalytic degradation of the RhB solution over a wide range of pH values, indicating the characteristics of the photodegradation of organic pollutants in a wide range of aqueous environments. Furthermore, the results of the cyclic degradation experiments demonstrated that the C-TM-CN composite film maintained a degradation efficiency of over 85% after five cycles, thereby confirming a notable improvement in its cyclic stability. Consequently, the C-TM-CN composite film exhibits excellent photocatalytic performance and is readily recyclable, making it an auspicious eco-friendly material in water environment remediation.},

Herein, we have successfully synthesized platinum nanoparticles incorporated in a Co3O4 nanostructure (denoted as Pt-Co3O4) that show superior HER activity and stability in alkaline solutions (the overpotentials of 37 mV to reach 10 mA cm−2). The outstanding electrocatalytic activity originates from synergistic effects between Pt and Co3O4 and increased electron conduction. Theoretical calculations show a significant decrease in the ΔGH* of Co active sites and a remarkable increase in electron transport. Our work puts forward a special and simple synthesized way of adjusting the H* adsorption energy of an inert site for application in HER.},

ABSTRACT = {The chemical stability of azithromycin (AZM) may be compromised depending on the imposed thermo-oxidative conditions. This report addresses evidence of this process under varying conditions of temperature (20–80 °C), exposure time to UV radiation (1–3 h irradiation at 257 nm), and air saturation (1–3 h saturation with atmospheric air at 1.2 L min−1 and 15 kPa) through electrochemical measurements performed with a thermoactivated cerium molybdate (Ce2(MoO4)3)/multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT)-based composite electrode. Thermal treatment at 120 °C led to coordinated water elimination in Ce2(MoO4)3, improving its electrocatalytic effect on antibiotic oxidation, while MWCNT were essential to reduce the charge-transfer resistance and promote signal amplification. Theoretical–experimental data revealed remarkable reactivity for the irreversible oxidation of AZM on the working sensor using phosphate buffer (pH = 8) prepared in CH3OH/H2O (10:90%, v/v). Highly sensitive (230 nM detection limit) and precise (RSD < 4.0%) measurements were recorded under these conditions. The results also showed that AZM reduces its half-life as the temperature, exposure time to UV radiation, and air saturation increase. This fact reinforces the need for continuous quality control of AZM-based pharmaceuticals, using conditions closer to those observed during their transport and storage, reducing impacts on consumers’ health.},

ABSTRACT = {In recent years, conductive polymer nanocomposites have gained significant attention due to their promising thermoresistive and Joule heating properties across a range of versatile applications, such as heating elements, smart materials, and thermistors. This paper presents an investigation of semi-crystalline polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) nanocomposites with 6 wt.% carbon-based nanofillers, namely graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs), multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), and a combination of GNPs and MWCNTs (hybrid). The influence of the mono- and hybrid fillers on the crystalline structure was analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). It was found that the nanocomposites had increased amorphous fraction compared to the neat PVDF. Furthermore, nanocomposites enhanced the β phase of the PVDF by up to 12% mainly due to the presence of MWCNTs. The resistive properties of the nanocompositions were weakly affected by the temperature in the analyzed temperature range of 25–100 °C; nevertheless, the hybrid filler composites were proven to be more sensitive than the monofiller ones. The Joule heating effect was observed when 8 and 10 V were applied, and the compositions reached a self-regulating effect at around 100–150 s. In general, the inclusion in PVDF of nanofillers such as GNPs and MWCNTs, and especially their hybrid combinations, may be successfully used for tuning the self-regulated Joule heating properties of the nanocomposites.},

Synthesis optimization was also performed, employing the variation in the reagents ratio to highlight the concentration domains in which magnetite is mainly produced, the formation of nanoparticles with different diameters and low polydispersity, and the stability of colloidal dispersions in water. The obtained materials were further characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering (DLS), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), with the experimental results confirming the production of salicylic acid-functionalized iron oxide (Fe3O4-SA) nanoparticles adapted for different further applications.},

ABSTRACT = {Currently, one of the most important problems of environmental protection is the deep and complex processing of mineral raw materials. This problem is especially relevant when processing substandard ores and production waste, one of which is phosphogypsum. This study examines the process of CaSO4/CaS composite material formation during the reduction of phosphogypsum with citric acid. The composite structure formation mechanism is proposed. The resulting materials are characterized using various methods, including X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy, the Scherrer method, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and FT-IR spectroscopy. The reduced sample emits orange radiation in the range of 500–750 nm with a quantum yield of 0.17. Experimental results showed that the sample decomposition process in the solid state consisted of two components with a predominant contribution from the long-lived component (~46 ns). The optimal conditions for producing luminescent materials by reducing phosphogypsum with citric acid were determined: a heat treatment temperature of 1073 K, a holding time of 60 min, and a reducing agent mole fraction of 37%. It was found that an increase in temperature with a simultaneous decrease in heat treatment time, as well as a decrease in temperature with a simultaneous increase in heat treatment time, led to a decrease in the luminescent properties of the synthesized material compared to optimal values. The results can be used to develop technology for recycling large-tonnage waste from the chemical industry into luminescent materials.},

The obtained IONP@Coum-C11-PPhOx27-PMOx59 nano-objects are perfectly dispersible in water and able to provide macroscopic heating remotely triggered by an alternating current magnetic field (AMF) with a specific absorption rate (SAR) value of 240 W.g−1 or laser irradiation with a photothermal conversion efficiency of η = 68%. On the other hand, they exhibit temperature-dependent emission of coumarin offering the function of luminescent thermometer, which operates in the visible region between 20 °C and 60 °C in water displaying a maximal relative thermal sensitivity (Sr) of 1.53%·°C−1 at 60 °C.},

ABSTRACT = {To revolutionize the photochemical efficiency of quantum dots sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs) devices, herein, a passivation of the cells with multilayer material has been developed for heterojunctions TiO2/NiS/MnS/HI-30/Pt devices. In this study, NiS and MnS were deposited on a photoanode for the first time as passivated photon absorbers at room temperature. The adoption of NiS as a passisvative layer could tailor the active surface area and improve the photochemical properties of the newly modified cells. The vibrational shifts obtained from the Raman spectra imply that the energy change is influenced by the surface effect, giving rise to better electronic conductivity. The electrochemical stability and durability test for the N/M-3 device slows down and remains at 8.88% of its initial current after 3500 s, as compared to the N/M-1 device at 7.20%. The disparity in charge recombination implies that both the outer and inner parts of the nanoporous material are involved in the photogeneration reaction. The hybridized N/M-3 cell device reveals the highest current density with a low potential onset, indicating that power conversion occurs more easily because photons tend to be adsorbed easily on the surface of the MnS. The Nyquist plot for N/M-1 and N/M-3 promotes the faster transport of electrolytic ions across the TiO2/NiS/MnS, providing a good interaction for the electrolyte. The I-J Value of 9.94% shows that the passivation with the NiS layer promotes electron transport and enhances the performance of the modified cells. The passivation of the TiO2 layer with NiS attains a better power conversion efficiency among the scant studies so far on the surface passivation of QDSCs.},

ABSTRACT = {Defect manipulation in metal oxide is of great importance in boosting catalytic performance for propane oxidation. Herein, a selective atom removal strategy was developed to construct a defective manganese oxide catalyst, which involved the partial etching of a Mg dopant in MnOx. The resulting MgMnOx-H catalysts exhibited superior low-temperature catalytic activity (T50 = 185 °C, T90 = 226 °C) with a propane conversion rate of 0.29 μmol·gcat.−1·h−1 for the propane oxidation reaction, which is 4.8 times that of pristine MnOx. Meanwhile, a robust hydrothermal stability was guaranteed at 250 °C for 30 h of reaction time. The comprehensive experimental characterizations revealed that the catalytic performance improvement was closely related to the defective structures including the abundant (metal and oxygen) vacancies, distorted crystals, valence imbalance, etc., which prominently weakened the Mn-O bond and stimulated the mobility of surface lattice oxygen, leading to the elevation in the intrinsic oxidation activity. This work exemplifies the significance of defect engineering for the promotion of the oxidation ability of metal oxide, which will be valuable for the further development of efficient non-noble metal catalysts for propane oxidation.},

ABSTRACT = { In this study, a KrF excimer laser with a high-absorption coefficient in metal oxide films and a wavelength of 248 nm was selected for the post-processing of a film and metal oxide thin film transistor (MOTFT). Due to the poor negative bias illumination stress (NBIS) stability of indium gallium zinc oxide thin film transistor (IGZO-TFT) devices, terbium-doped Tb:In2O3 material was selected as the target of this study. The XPS test revealed the presence of both Tb3+ and Tb4+ ions in the Tb:In2O3 film. It was hypothesized that the peak of the laser thermal effect was reduced and the action time was prolonged by the f-f jump of Tb3+ ions and the C-T jump of Tb4+ ions during the laser treatment. Studies related to the treatment of Tb:In2O3 films with different laser energy densities have been carried out. It is shown that as the laser energy density increases, the film density increases, the thickness decreases, the carrier concentration increases, and the optical band gap widens. Terbium has a low electronegativity (1.1 eV) and a high Tb-O dissociation energy (707 kJ/mol), which brings about a large lattice distortion. The Tb:In2O3 films did not show significant crystallization even under laser energy density treatment of up to 250 mJ/cm2. Compared with pure In2O3-TFT, the doping of Tb ions effectively reduces the off-state current (1.16 × 10−11 A vs. 1.66 × 10−12 A), improves the switching current ratio (1.63 × 106 vs. 1.34 × 107) and improves the NBIS stability (ΔVON = −10.4 V vs. 6.4 V) and positive bias illumination stress (PBIS) stability (ΔVON = 8 V vs. 1.6 V).},

ABSTRACT = {The growth of high-composition GeSn films in the future will likely be guided by algorithms. In this study, we show how a logarithmic-based algorithm can be used to obtain high-quality GeSn compositions up to 16% on GaAs (001) substrates via molecular beam epitaxy. Herein, we use composition targeting and logarithmic Sn cell temperature control to achieve linearly graded pseudomorph Ge1−xSnx compositions up to 10% before partial relaxation of the structure and a continued gradient up to 16% GeSn. In this report, we use X-ray diffraction, simulation, secondary ion mass spectrometry, and atomic force microscopy to analyze and demonstrate some of the possible growths that can be produced with the enclosed algorithm. This methodology of growth is a major step forward in the field of GeSn development and the first ever demonstration of algorithmically driven, linearly graded GeSn films.},

ABSTRACT = {The ceramic tile industry, with significant energy and material demands in its manufacturing processes, has employed technological innovations in energy efficiency, advanced equipment and tile thickness reduction to address these challenges. This study aimed to assess the impact of Ag2O, CuFe2O4, Fe3O4, and SiO2 nanoparticles (0%, 1%, and 5% by weight) on the mechanical strength, water absorption, and apparent thermal conductivity of ceramic tiles, as well as their capacity to reduce energy and raw material consumption. This reduction translates into a decrease in environmental impacts, which have been evaluated through life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology applied to the manufacturing processes. Nanoparticles (Ag2O, CuFe2O4, Fe3O4, and SiO2) were initially screened on TF clay (0%, 1%, 5% w/w), and the most effective were applied to CR1 and CR2 clays (0%, 1%, 5% w/w). Findings indicated a 32% increase in temperature gradient and a 16% improvement in flexural strength with the addition of Fe3O4 nanoparticle at 1% (w/w) in TF clay. Furthermore, there was a potential 48% reduction in energy consumption, and up to 16% decrease in tile weight or thickness without affecting the flexural strength property of the test tiles. LCA results demonstrated that the addition of Fe3O4 nanoparticle has potential reductions of up to 20% in environmental impacts. This study suggests that nanoparticle addition offers a viable alternative for reducing energy and material consumption in the ceramic tile industry. Future research should focus on assessing the economic impact of transitioning to a sustainable business model in the ceramic tile industry with nanoparticles addition.},

ABSTRACT = {With the intensification of global climate problems, electric heating has recently attracted much attention as a clean and low-carbon heating method. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are an ideal medium for electric heating applications due to their excellent mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties. The preparation of electrothermal films based on an aqueous CNT dispersion as a raw material is environmentally friendly. However, in the traditional one-step filtration method, the residual excess dispersant and the small aspect ratio of the CNTs in the preparation process limit the performance of electrothermal CNT films. In this paper, we report a two-step filtration method that removes the free dispersant and small CNTs in the first filtration step and obtains denser CNT films by controlling the pores of the filter membrane in the second filtration step. The results suggest that, compared to the CNT1 film obtained from one-step filtration, the CNT1-0.22 film, obtained from two-step filtration using 1 and 0.22 μm membranes, has a smoother and flatter surface, and the surface resistance is 80.0 Ω sq−1, which is 29.4% lower. The convective radiation conversion efficiency of the CNT1-0.22 film is 3.36 mW/°C, which is 36.1% lower. We anticipate that such CNT films could be widely applied in building thermal insulation and underfloor heating.},

ABSTRACT = {Silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) have been produced by low-dose (1–20 kGy) gamma irradiation of silver nitrate in the presence of graphene-based material (graphene oxide or electrochemically exfoliated graphene). The large surface area of those graphene-based materials combined with the presence of oxygen-containing functional groups on the surface provided successful nucleation and growth of Ag nanoparticles, which resulted in a uniformly covered graphene surface. The obtained Ag nanoparticles were spherical with a predominant size distribution of 10–50 nm for graphene oxide and 10–100 nm for electrochemically exfoliated graphene. The photothermal efficiency measurement showed a temperature increase upon exposure to a 532 nm laser for all samples and the highest photothermal efficiency was measured for the graphene oxide/Ag NP sample prepared at 5 kGy. Electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding efficiency measurements showed poor shielding for the composites prepared with graphene oxide. On the other hand, all composites prepared with electrochemically exfoliated graphene showed EMI shielding to some extent, and the best performance was measured for the samples prepared at 5 and 20 kGy doses.},

ABSTRACT = {With the rapid development of terahertz radar technology, the electromagnetic device for terahertz radar cross-section (RCS) reduction is worth investigating. However, the existing research concentrates on the RCS reduction metasurface with fixed performance working in the microwave band. This paper proposes a terahertz dynamic coding metasurface integrated with vanadium dioxide (VO2) for dual-polarized, dual-band, and wide-angle RCS reduction. The simulation result indicates that by switching the state of the VO2 between insulator and metal, the metasurface can realize the effective RCS reduction at 0.18 THz to 0.24 THz and 0.21 THz to 0.39 THz under the left-handed and right-handed circularly polarized incident waves. When the polar and azimuth angles of the incident wave vary from 0° to 40° and 0° to 360° respectively, this metasurface can maintain a 10 dB RCS reduction. This work has potential value in the terahertz stealth field.},

ABSTRACT = {Previous research using the model soil nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has revealed that silver nanoparticles (AgNP) and their transformed counterpart, sulfidized AgNP (sAgNP), reduce their reproduction and survival. To expand our understanding of the environmental consequences of released NP, we examined the synergistic/antagonistic effects of AgNP and sAgNP along with AgNO3 (ionic control) on C. elegans infected with the pathogen Klebsiella pneumoniae. Individual exposures to each stressor significantly decreased nematode reproduction compared to controls. Combined exposures to equitoxic EC30 concentrations of two stressors, Ag in nanoparticulate (AgNP or sAgNP) or ionic form and the pathogen K. pneumoniae, showed a decline in the reproduction that was not significantly different compared to individual exposures of each of the stressors. The lack of enhanced toxicity after simultaneous combined exposure is partially due to Ag decreasing K. pneumoniae pathogenicity by inhibiting biofilm production outside the nematode and significantly reducing viable pathogens inside the host. Taken together, our results indicate that by hindering the ability of K. pneumoniae to colonize the nematode’s intestine, Ag reduces K. pneumoniae pathogenicity regardless of Ag form. These results differ from our previous research where simultaneous exposure to zinc oxide (ZnO) NP and K. pneumoniae led to a reproduction level that was not significantly different from the controls.},

ABSTRACT = {Silicon qubits based on specific SOI FinFETs and nanowire (NW) transistors have demonstrated promising quantum properties and the potential application of advanced Si CMOS devices for future quantum computing. In this paper, for the first time, the quantum transport characteristics for the next-generation transistor structure of a stack nanosheet (NS) FET and the innovative structure of a fishbone FET are explored. Clear structures are observed by TEM, and their low-temperature characteristics are also measured down to 6 K. Consistent with theoretical predictions, greatly enhanced switching behavior characterized by the reduction of off-state leakage current by one order of magnitude at 6 K and a linear decrease in the threshold voltage with decreasing temperature is observed. A quantum ballistic transport, particularly notable at shorter gate lengths and lower temperatures, is also observed, as well as an additional bias of about 1.3 mV at zero bias due to the asymmetric barrier. Additionally, fishbone FETs, produced by the incomplete nanosheet release in NSFETs, exhibit similar electrical characteristics but with degraded quantum transport due to additional SiGe channels. These can be improved by adjusting the ratio of the channel cross-sectional areas to match the dielectric constants.},

ABSTRACT = {Fentanyl (FTN) and synthetic analogs of FTN continue to ravage populations across the globe, including in the United States where opioids are increasingly being used and abused and are causing a staggering and growing number of overdose deaths each year. This growing pandemic is worsened by the ease with which FTN can be derivatized into numerous derivatives. Understanding the chemical properties/behaviors of the FTN class of compounds is critical for developing effective chemical detection schemes using nanoparticles (NPs) to optimize important chemical interactions. Halogen bonding (XB) is an intermolecular interaction between a polarized halogen atom on a molecule and e−-rich sites on another molecule, the latter of which is present at two or more sites on most fentanyl-type structures. Density functional theory (DFT) is used to identify these XB acceptor sites on different FTN derivatives. The high toxicity of these compounds necessitated a “fragmentation” strategy where smaller, non-toxic molecules resembling parts of the opioids acted as mimics of XB acceptor sites present on intact FTN and its derivatives. DFT of the fragments’ interactions informed solution measurements of XB using 19F NMR titrations as well as electrochemical measurements of XB at self-assembled monolayer (SAM)-modified electrodes featuring XB donor ligands. Gold NPs, known as monolayer-protected clusters (MPCs), were also functionalized with strong XB donor ligands and assembled into films, and their interactions with FTN “fragments” were studied using voltammetry. Ultimately, spectroscopy and TEM analysis were combined to study whole-molecule FTN interactions with the functionalized MPCs in solution. The results suggested that the strongest XB interaction site on FTN, while common to most of the drug’s derivatives, is not strong enough to induce NP-aggregation detection but may be better exploited in sensing schemes involving films.},

ABSTRACT = {We propose a controllable topological add-drop filter based on magnetic–optical photonic crystals. This add-drop filter is composed of two straight waveguides and a hexagonal photonic crystal ring resonator. The waveguide and ring resonator are constructed by three different honeycomb magnetic–optical photonic crystals. The expanded lattice is applied with an external magnetic field so that it breaks time-reversal symmetry and the analogous quantum spin Hall effect simultaneously. While the standard one and the compressed one are not magnetized and trivial, the straight waveguide supports pseudospin-down (or pseudospin-up) one-way states when the expanded lattice is applied with an external magnetic field of +H (or −H). The ring resonator possesses multiple resonant modes which can be divided into travelling modes and standing modes. By using the travelling modes, we have demonstrated the function of the add-drop filter and realized the output port control by changing the direction of the magnetic field. Moreover, a large tunable power ratio from near 0 to 52.6 is achieved by adjusting the strength of the external magnetic field. The structure has strong robustness against defects due to the topological protection property. These results have potential in wavelength division multiplexing systems and integrated topological optical devices.},

ABSTRACT = {A sequence of dye-sensitized solar cells is proposed, utilizing TiO2@Zn/Al-layered double hydroxide (LDH) as their starting materials, in which Ruthenizer N719 was used as a photon absorber. The anticipated system was turned into sheet-like TiO2@mixed metal oxide (MMO) via post-processing treatment. The crystal quality indicated a relation to power conversion efficiency (PCE); this was combined with a comparable morphology profile. In detail, the optimum DSSC device exhibited average sheet-like thickness and a dye loading amount of 43.11 nm and 4.28 ×10−3 mM/cm−2, respectively. Concurrently, a considerable PCE enhancement of the optimum DSSC device (TiO2@MMO-550°) was attained compared to pristine MMO (0.91%), which could be due to boosted electron transfer efficiency. Of the fabricated devices, DSSC fabricated at 550° exhibited the highest PCE (1.91%), with a 35.6% enhancement compared to that obtained at 450°, as a result of its increased open-circuit voltage (3.29 mA/cm2) and short-circuit current (0.81 V). The proposed work delivers an enhanced efficiency as compared to similar geometries.},

ABSTRACT = {Metal–support interaction plays a critical role in determining the eventual catalytic activity of metals loaded on supporting substrates. This interaction can sometimes cause a significant drop in the metallic property of the loaded metal and, hence, a drop in catalytic activity in the reactions, especially in those for which low charge carrier transfer resistance is a necessary parameter. Therefore, there should be a case-by-case experimental or theoretical (or both) in-depth investigation to understand the role of support on each metal. Here, onto a layered porous carbon nitride (g-CN), we grew single crystalline Pt nanodisks (Pt@g-CN) with a lateral average size of 21 nm, followed by various characterisations such as electron microscopy techniques, and the measurement of electrocatalytic activity in the O2 reduction reaction (ORR). We found that intercalating Pt nanodisks in the g-CN interlayers causes an increase in electrocatalytic activity. We investigated the bonding mechanism between carbon support and platinum using density functional theory and applied the d-band theory to understand the catalytic performance. Analysis of Pt’s density of states and electronic population across layers sheds light on the catalytic behaviour of Pt nanoparticles, particularly in relation to their thickness and proximity to the g-CN support interface. Our simulation reveals an optimum thickness of ~11 Å, under which the catalytic performance deteriorates.},

ABSTRACT = {Ensuring the stable operation of proton exchange membrane fuel cells is conducive to their real-world application. A promising direction for stabilizing electrodes is the stabilization of the ionomer via the formation of surface compounds with graphene. A comprehensive study of the (electrochemical, chemical, and thermal) stability of composites for fuel cell electrodes containing a modifying additive of few-layer graphene was carried out. Electrochemical stability was studied by cycling the potential on a disk electrode for 5000 cycles. Chemical stability was assessed via the resistance of the composites to H2O2 treatment using ion-selective potentiometry. Thermal stability was studied using differential thermal analysis. Composites were characterized by UV-Vis spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, EDX, and SEM. It was shown that graphene inhibits Nafion degradation when exposed to heat. Contrariwise, Nafion is corrosive to graphene. During electrochemical and chemical exposure, the determining change for carbon-rich composites is the carbon loss (oxidation) of the carbon material. In the case of carbon-poor composites, the removal of fluorine and sulfur from the Nafion polymer with their partial replacement by oxygen prevails. In all cases, the F/S ratio is stable. The dispersity of Nafion in a sample affects its chemical stability more than the G/Nafion ratio does.},

ABSTRACT = {Creating oxygen vacancy in tungsten trioxide (WO3) has been considered as an effective strategy to improve the photocatalytic performance for degrading organic pollutants. In this study, oxygen vacancies were introduced into WO3 by thermal treatment under Ar atmosphere and their proportion was changed by setting different treatment times. WO3−x samples show better photoelectric properties and photocatalytic degradation performance for carbamazepine (CBZ) than an oxygen-vacancy-free sample, and WO3−x with the optimal proportion of oxygen vacancies is obtained by thermal treatment for 3 h in 550 °C. Furthermore, it discovers that the surface oxygen vacancies on WO3−x would be recovered when it is exposed to air, resulting in a bulk oxygen vacancy dominating WO3−x (bulk-WO3−x). The bulk-WO3−x exhibited much higher degradation efficiency for CBZ than WO3−x with both surface and bulk oxygen vacancies. The mechanism study shows bulk-WO3−x mainly degrades the CBZ by producing OH radicals and superoxide radicals, while oxygen-vacancy-free sample mainly oxidizes the CBZ by the photoexcited hole, which requires the CBZ to be adsorbed on the surface for degradation. The radical generated by bulk-WO3−x exhibits stronger oxidizing capacity by migrating to the solution for CBZ degradation. In summary, the influence of oxygen vacancy on photocatalytic degradation performance depends on both the proportion and location distribution and could lie in the optimization of the photodegradation mechanism. The results of this study could potentially broaden our understanding of the role of oxygen vacancies and provide optimal directions and methods for oxygen vacancy regulation for photocatalysts.},

ABSTRACT = {Polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) have attracted much attention as highly efficient, eco-friendly energy conversion devices. However, carbon-supported Pt (Pt/C) catalysts for PEMFCs still have several problems, such as low long-term stability, to be widely commercialized in fuel cell applications. To address the stability issues of Pt/C such as the dissolution, detachment, and agglomeration of Pt nanoparticles under harsh operating conditions, we design an interesting fabrication process to produce a highly active and durable Pt catalyst by introducing a robust carbon shell on the Pt surface. Furthermore, this approach provides insights into how to regulate the carbon shell layer for fuel cell applications. Through the application of an appropriate amount of H2 gas during heat treatment, the carbon shell pores, which are integral to the structure, can be systematically modulated to facilitate oxygen adsorption for the oxygen reduction reaction. Simultaneously, the carbon shell functions as a protective barrier, preventing catalyst degradation. In this regard, we investigate an in-depth analysis of the effects of critical parameters including H2 content and the flow rate of H2/N2 mixed gas during heat treatment to prepare better catalysts.},

ABSTRACT = {High-throughput methods are extremely important in today’s materials science, especially in the case of thin film characterization. The micro-combinatorial method enables the deposition and characterization of entire multicomponent thin film systems within a single sample. In this paper, we report the application of this method for the comprehensive TEM characterization of the Y-Ti-O layer system. Variable composition samples (YxTi1−xOy) were prepared by dual DC magnetron sputtering, covering the entire (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) concentration range. The structure and morphology of phases formed in both as-deposited and annealed samples at 600, 700, and 800 °C were revealed as a function of Y-Ti composition (x). A comprehensive map showing the appropriate amorphous and crystalline phases, and their occurrence regions of the whole Y-Ti-O layer system, was revealed. Thanks to the applied method, it was shown with ease that at the given experimental conditions, the Y2Ti2O7 phase with a pyrochlore structure forms already at 700 °C without the TiO2 and Y2O3 by-phases, which is remarkably lower than the required temperature for most physical preparation methods, demonstrating the importance and benefits of creating phase maps in materials science and technology.},

In this paper, an efficient and reusable catalytic system is developed based on coating magnetic Fe3O4 by depositing Fe2+ on the surface of ZnO. The Fe3O4/ZnO nanocomposite exhibits enhanced performance for organic pollutant degradation. The Fe3O4/ZnO system demonstrates a high photocatalytic activity of 100% degradation efficiency in Rhodamine B (RhB) degradation under UV light irradiation for 50 min. The excellent photocatalytic activity is primarily due to the separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs being facilitated by the strong interaction between Fe3O4 and ZnO. The induction of the magnetic Fe3O4 endows the Fe3O4/ZnO composite with superior magnetic separation capability from water. Experiments with different radical scavengers revealed that the hydroxyl radical (·OH) is the key reactive radical for the effective degradation of RhB. This work innovatively affords a common interfacial dopant deposition strategy for catalytic application in the degradation of organic dye pollutants and catalyst separation from wastewater efficiently.},

ABSTRACT = {Recently, nanoparticles have been widely used in agricultural pest control as a secure substitute for pesticides. However, the effect of nanoparticles on controlling the subterranean termite Odontotermes formosanus (O. formosanus) has not been studied yet. Consequently, this study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of some nanomaterials in controlling O. formosanus. The results showed that zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnONPs), titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2NPs), and chitosan nanoparticles (CsNPs) biosynthesized using the culture filtrate of Scedosporium apiospermum (S. apiospermum) had an effective role in controlling O. formosanus. Moreover, the mortality rate of O. formosanus after 48 h of treatment with ZnONPs, TiO2NPs, and CsNPs at a 1000 µg/mL concentration was 100%, 100%, and 97.67%, respectively. Furthermore, using ZnONPs, TiO2NPs, and CsNPs on O. formosanus resulted in morpho-histological variations in the normal structure, leading to its death. X-ray diffraction, UV-vis spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, dynamic light scattering, energy dispersive spectroscopy, and the Zeta potential were used to characterize the biosynthesis of ZnONPs, TiO2NPs, and CsNPs with strong activity against O. formosanus termites. Overall, the results of this investigation suggest that biosynthesized ZnONPs, TiO2NPs, and CsNPs have enormous potential for use as innovative, ecologically safe pesticides for O. formosanus control.},
