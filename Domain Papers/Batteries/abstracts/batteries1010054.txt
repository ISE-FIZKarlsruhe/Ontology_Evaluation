KOH-based electrolytes with different salt additives were investigated to reduce their corrosive nature toward Mg/Ni metal hydride alloys used as negative electrodes in nickel metal hydride (Ni/MH) batteries. Alkaline metal halide salts and oxyacid salts were studied as additives to the traditional KOH electrolyte with concentrations varying from 0.005 M to 1.77 M. Effects of the cations and anions of the additives on charge/discharge performance are discussed. The reduction potential of alkaline cations and radii of halogen anions were correlated with initial capacity and degradation of the metal hydride alloy. A synergistic effect between KOH and some oxyacid salt additives was observed and greatly influenced by the nature of the salt additives. It was suggested that both the formation of a solid film over the metal hydride surface and the promotion of proton transfer in the additives containing electrolytes led to a decreased degradation of the electrodes and an increased discharge capacity. 12 salt additives, NaC2H3O2, KC2H3O2, K2CO3, Rb2CO3, Cs2CO3, K3PO4, Na2WO4, Rb2SO4, Cs2SO4, NaF, KF, and KBr, were found to increase the corrosion resistance of the MgNi-based metal hydride alloy.
