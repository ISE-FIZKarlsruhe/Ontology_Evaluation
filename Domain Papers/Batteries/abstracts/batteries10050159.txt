Blended electrodes are becoming increasingly more popular in lithium-ion batteries, yet most modeling approaches are still lacking the ability to separate the blend components. This is problematic because the different components are unlikely to degrade at the same pace. This work investigated a new approach towards the simulation of blended electrodes by replicating the complex current distributions within the electrodes using a paralleling model rather than the traditional constant-current method. In addition, a blending model was used to generate three publicly available datasets with more than 260,000 unique degradations for three exemplary blended cells. These datasets allowed us to showcase the necessity of considering all active components of the blend separately for diagnosis and prognosis.
