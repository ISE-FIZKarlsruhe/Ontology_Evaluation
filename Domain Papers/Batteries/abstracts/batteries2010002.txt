The goal of the Robust Affordable Next Generation Energy Storage System (RANGE)-BASF program is to provide an alternative solution for the energy storage media that powers electric vehicles other than the existing Li-ion battery. With the use of a rare-earth-free metal hydride (MH) as the active negative electrode material, together with a core-shell type alpha-beta nickel hydroxide as the active positive electrode and a sealed pouch design, an energy density of 145 Wh·kg−1 and cost model of $120 kWh−1 are shown to be feasible. Combined with the proven safety record and cycle stability, we have demonstrated the feasibility of using a Ni-MH battery in EV applications.
