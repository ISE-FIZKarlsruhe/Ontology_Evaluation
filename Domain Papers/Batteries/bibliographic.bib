ABSTRACT = {An automatic fast charger station with a power level of 120 kW is developed for city Bus Line 60 in Gothenburg, Sweden. There are some power quality issues towards the utility grid during the charger operation. The aim of this paper is to explain the project and to present the measurement results with respect to power quality issues. The main specifications of the battery, charger, charging infrastructure and bus route are explained. The measurement results show that the harmonic emission is within the prescribed limit despite the high amount of low-frequency harmonics because of a passive diode rectification. It is suggested to replace the passive diode rectifier with an active front-end converter to eliminate low order current harmonics and to obtain a unity power factor operation. The main contribution of this work is to demonstrate a practical example of an electric charging system for an electric public transport system in Gothenburg.},

ABSTRACT = {Structural, gaseous phase hydrogen storage, and electrochemical properties of a series of annealed (900 °C for 12 h) Laves phase-related body-centered-cubic (BCC) solid solution metal hydride (MH) alloys with vanadium/nickel (V/Ni) contents ranging from 44/18.5 to 28/34.5 were studied. As the average Ni-content increases, C14 phase evolves into the C15 phase and a new σ-VNi phase emerges; lattice constants in BCC, C14, and TiNi phase all decrease; the main plateau pressure increases; both gaseous phase and electrochemical hydrogen storage capacities decrease; the pressure-concentration-temperature (PCT) absorption/desorption hysteresis decreases; both high-rate dischargeability (HRD) and bulk hydrogen diffusivity increase and then decrease; and the surface reaction current decreases. There is a capacity-rate tradeoff with the change in V/Ni content. Alloys with relatively lower Ni-content show higher capacities but inferior high-rate performance compared to commercially available AB5 MH alloy. Increasing the Ni-content in this BCC-based multi-phase alloy can improve the high-rate capability over AB5 alloy but with lower discharge capacities. The inferior surface reaction current in these alloys, compared to AB5, may be due to the smaller surface area, not the total volume, of the Ni clusters embedded in the surface oxide layer of the activated alloys.},

ABSTRACT = {KOH-based electrolytes with different salt additives were investigated to reduce their corrosive nature toward Mg/Ni metal hydride alloys used as negative electrodes in nickel metal hydride (Ni/MH) batteries. Alkaline metal halide salts and oxyacid salts were studied as additives to the traditional KOH electrolyte with concentrations varying from 0.005 M to 1.77 M. Effects of the cations and anions of the additives on charge/discharge performance are discussed. The reduction potential of alkaline cations and radii of halogen anions were correlated with initial capacity and degradation of the metal hydride alloy. A synergistic effect between KOH and some oxyacid salt additives was observed and greatly influenced by the nature of the salt additives. It was suggested that both the formation of a solid film over the metal hydride surface and the promotion of proton transfer in the additives containing electrolytes led to a decreased degradation of the electrodes and an increased discharge capacity. 12 salt additives, NaC2H3O2, KC2H3O2, K2CO3, Rb2CO3, Cs2CO3, K3PO4, Na2WO4, Rb2SO4, Cs2SO4, NaF, KF, and KBr, were found to increase the corrosion resistance of the MgNi-based metal hydride alloy.},

ABSTRACT = {Structure, gaseous phase hydrogen storage, and electrochemical properties of a series of TiVCrMn-based body-centered-cubic (BCC) alloys with different partial substitutions for Mn with covalent elements (B and Si), transition metals (Ni, Zr, Nb, and Mo), and rare earth element (La) were investigated. Although the influences from substitutions on structure and gaseous phase storage properties were minor, influences on electrochemical discharge capacity were significant. The first cycle capacity ranged from 16 mAh·g−1 (Si-substituted) to 247 mAh·g−1 (Mo-substituted). Severe alloy passivation in 30% KOH electrolyte was observed, and an original capacity close to 500 mAh·g−1 could possibly be achieved by Mo-substituted alloy if a non-corrosive electrolyte was employed. Surface coating of Nafion to the Mo-substituted alloy was able to increase the first cycle capacity to 408 mAh·g−1, but the degradation rate in mAh·g−1·cycle−1 was still similar to that of standard testing. Electrochemical capacity was found to be closely related to BCC phase unit cell volume and width of the an extra small pressure plateau at around 0.3 MPa on the 30 °C pressure-concentration-temperature (PCT) desorption isotherm. Judging from its high electrochemical discharge capacity, Mo was the most beneficial substitution in BCC alloys for Ni/metal hydride (MH) battery application.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper describes an approach to determine a fast-charging profile for a lithium-ion battery by utilising a simplified single-particle electrochemical model and direct collocation methods for optimal control. An optimal control problem formulation and a direct solution approach were adopted to address the problem effectively. The results shows that, in some cases, the optimal current profile resembles the current profile in the Constant Current–Constant Voltage charging protocol. Several challenges and knowledge gaps were addressed in this work, including a reformulation of the optimal control problem that utilises direct methods as an alternative to overcome the limitations of indirect methods employed in similar studies. The proposed formulation considers the minimum-time optimal control case, trade-offs between the total charging time, the maximisation of the lithium bulk concentration, and energy efficiency, along with inequality constraints and other factors not previously considered in the literature, which can be helpful in practical applications.},

ABSTRACT = {Lithium-ion batteries are widely used in mobile applications because they offer a suitable package of characteristics in terms of specific energy, cost, and life span. Nevertheless, they have the potential to experience thermal runaway (TR), the prevention and containment of which require safety measures and intensive thermal management. This study introduces a novel combined thermal management and safety application designed for large aspect-ratio battery cells such as pouches and thin prismatics. It comprises polymer-based mini-channel cold plates that can indirectly thermally condition the batteries’ faces with liquid. They are lightweight and space-saving, making them suitable for mobile systems. Furthermore, this study experimentally clarifies to which extent the application of polymer mini-channel cold plates between battery cells is suitable to delay TR by heat dissipation and to prevent thermal runaway propagation (TRP) to adjacent cells by simultaneously acting as a thermal barrier. NMC pouch cells of 12.5 Ah capacity were overcharged at 1 C to induce TR. Without cold plates, TR and TRP occurred within one hour. Utilizing the polymer mini-channel cold plates for face cooling, the overcharge did not produce a condition leading to cell fire in the same time frame. When the fluid inlet temperature was varied between 5 and 40 °C, the overcharged cell’s surface temperature peaked between 50 and 60 °C. Indications were found that thermal conditioning with the polymer cold plates significantly slowed down parts of the process chain before cell firing. Their peak performance was measured to be just under 2.2 kW/m2. In addition, thermal management system malfunction was tested, and evidence was found that the polymer cold plates prevented TRP to adjacent cells. In conclusion, a combined thermal management and safety system made of polymer mini-channel cold plates provides necessary TR-related safety aspects in lithium battery systems and should be further investigated.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper provides a comprehensive exploration of float current analysis in lithium-ion batteries, a promising new testing method to assess calendar aging. Float currents are defined as the steady-state trickle charge current after a transient part. In the literature, a correlation to capacity loss was reported. Assuming the float current compensates for the voltage decay over time and is linked to calendar aging, effects from voltage slippery must be considered. The dU/dQ analysis suggests solely a loss of active lithium. Therefore, we investigate the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) growth as the general aging mechanism to explain the origin of float currents. Our results show that the voltage slippery theory holds true within the low to middle test voltage ranges. However, the theory’s explanatory power begins to diminish at higher voltage ranges, suggesting the existence of additional, yet unidentified, factors influencing the float current. A shuttle reaction or lithiation of the cathode by electrolyte decomposition are the most promising alternative aging mechanisms at high voltages. The paper proposes a unique voltage slippery model to check for correlations between aging mechanisms, the float current test and the check-up test. For a better understanding, test strategies are proposed to verify/falsify the aging mechanisms beyond SEI.},

ABSTRACT = {As an important element of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), the separator plays a critical role in the safety and comprehensive performance of the battery. Electrospun nanofiber separators have a high porosity and good electrolyte affinity, which are favorable to the transference of lithium ions. In this paper, the batch preparation of polyacrylonitrile (PAN)-based nanofiber separators are obtained via spherical section free surface electrospinning (SSFSE). Introducing an appropriate amount of polyester polyurethane (PU) can effectively enhance the mechanical property of PAN nanofiber separators and help the separators resist the external force extrusion. The results show that when PAN:PU = 8:2, the porosity and electrolyte uptake rate of the composite nanofiber separator (PAN-2) are 62.9% and 643.3%, respectively, exhibiting a high ionic conductivity (1.90 mS/cm). Additionally, the coin battery assembled with PAN-2 as a separator (LiFePO4/PAN-2/lithium metal) shows good cycling performance and good rate performance, with a capacity retention rate of 93.9% after 100 cycles at 0.5 C, indicating that the battery with PAN-2 has a good application potential in advanced energy storage.},

ABSTRACT = {Supercapacitors are extensively used in urban rail transit, electric vehicles, renewable energy storage, electronic products, and the military industry due to its long cycle life and high power density. Porous carbon materials are regarded as promising anode materials for supercapacitors due to their high specific surface areas and well-developed pore structures. However, the over-developed pore structure often results in poor conductivity and reduced cycle stability due to the destruction of a carbon skeleton. Herein, we introduce an advanced strategy for preparing porous carbon with high specific surface areas (3333 m2 g−1), high electrical conductivity (68.6 S m−1), and fast ion transport channels through secondary high-temperature carbonization treatment. As a result, the fabricated porous carbon anode delivers a high specific capacitance (199.2 F g−1 at 1 A g−1) and outstanding rate performance (136.3 F g−1 at 20 A g−1) in organic electrolyte. Furthermore, the assembled symmetrical supercapacitor achieves an energy density of 43.2 Wh kg−1 at 625.0 W kg−1, highlighting the potential of a secondary high-temperature carbonization strategy in practical applications.},

ABSTRACT = {The increasing global warming problem has pushed the community to implement emission reduction measures in almost every segment of human life. Since the major source of anthropogenic Greenhouse Gases (GHGs) is fossil fuel combustion, in the shipping sector, these measures are oriented toward a reduction in tailpipe emissions, where the replacement of traditional internal combustion marine engines with zero-carbon technologies offers the ultimate emission reduction results. According to the International Maritime Organization (IMO) GHG strategy, vessels involved in international shipping must achieve a minimum 50% reduction in their GHG emissions by 2050. However, this requirement does not extend to fishing vessels, which are significant consumers of fossil fuels. This paper deals with the full electrification of two types of fishing vessels (purse seiners and trawlers), wherein different Lithium-ion Batteries (LiBs) are considered. To investigate their environmental footprint and profitability, Life-Cycle Assessments (LCAs) and Life-Cycle Cost Assessments (LCCAs) are performed. The comparison of all-electric fishing vessels with existing diesel-powered ships highlighted the Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP) battery as the most suitable alternative powering option regarding environmental and economic criteria.},

ABSTRACT = {Vanadium redox-flow batteries (VRFBs) have played a significant role in hybrid energy storage systems (HESSs) over the last few decades owing to their unique characteristics and advantages. Hence, the accurate estimation of the VRFB model holds significant importance in large-scale storage applications, as they are indispensable for incorporating the distinctive features of energy storage systems and control algorithms within embedded energy architectures. In this work, we propose a novel approach that combines model-based and data-driven techniques to predict battery state variables, i.e., the state of charge (SoC), voltage, and current. Our proposal leverages enhanced deep reinforcement learning techniques, specifically deep q-learning (DQN), by combining q-learning with neural networks to optimize the VRFB-specific parameters, ensuring a robust fit between the real and simulated data. Our proposed method outperforms the existing approach in voltage prediction. Subsequently, we enhance the proposed approach by incorporating a second deep RL algorithm—dueling DQN—which is an improvement of DQN, resulting in a 10% improvement in the results, especially in terms of voltage prediction. The proposed approach results in an accurate VFRB model that can be generalized to several types of redox-flow batteries.},

ABSTRACT = {Lithium-ion batteries are key elements in the development of electrical energy storage solutions. However, due to cycling, environmental, and operating conditions, battery capacity tends to degrade over time. Capacity fade is a common indicator of battery state of health (SOH) because it is an indication of how the capacity has been degraded. However, battery capacity cannot be measured directly, and thus, there is an urgent need to develop methods for estimating battery capacity in real time. By analyzing the historical data of a battery in detail, it is possible to predict the future state of a battery and forecast its remaining useful life. This study developed a real-time, simple, and fast method to estimate the cycle capacity of a battery during the charge cycle using only data from a short period of each charge cycle. This proposal is attractive because it does not require data from the entire charge period since batteries are rarely charged from zero to full. The proposed method allows for simultaneous and accurate real-time prediction of the health and remaining useful life of the battery over its lifetime. The accuracy of the proposed method was tested using experimental data from several lithium-ion batteries with different cathode chemistries under various test conditions.},

ABSTRACT = {Non-aqueous redox flow batteries (NARFBs) have been attracting much attention because they can significantly increase power and energy density compared to conventional RFBs. In this study, novel pore-filled anion-exchange membranes (PFAEMs) for application to a NAPFB employing metal polypyridyl complexes (i.e., Fe(bpy)32+/Fe(bpy)33+ and Co(bpy)32+/Co(bpy)33+) as the redox species are successfully developed. A porous polyethylene support with excellent solvent resistance and mechanical strength is used for membrane fabrication. The PFAEMs are prepared by filling an ionic liquid monomer containing an imidazolium group and a crosslinking agent into the pores of the support film and then performing in situ photopolymerization. As a result, the prepared membranes exhibit excellent mechanical strength and stability in a non-aqueous medium as well as high ion conductivity. In addition, a low crossover rate for redox ion species is observed for the prepared membranes because they have relatively low swelling characteristics in non-aqueous electrolyte solutions and low affinity for the metal-complex redox species compared to a commercial membrane. Consequently, the PFAEM is revealed to possess superior battery performance than a commercial membrane in the NARFB tests, showing high energy efficiency of about 85% and stable operation for 100 cycles.},

ABSTRACT = {Li-ion batteries (LIBs) represent the most sophisticated electrochemical energy storage technology. Nevertheless, they still suffer from safety issues and practical drawbacks related to the use of toxic and flammable liquid electrolytes. Thus, polymer-based solid electrolytes may be a suitable option to fulfill the safety and energy density requirements, even though the lack of high ionic conductivity at 25 °C (10−8–10−7 S cm−1) hinders their performance. To overcome these drawbacks, herein, we present an all-solid-state Li-metal full cell based on a three-component solid poly(ethylene oxide)/lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide/titanium dioxide composite electrolyte that outclasses the conventional poly(ethylene oxide)-based solid electrolytes. Moreover, the cell features are enhanced by the combination of the solid electrolyte with a self-standing LiFePO4 catholyte fabricated through an innovative, simple and easily scalable approach. The structural, morphological and compositional properties of this system are characterized, and the results show that the electrochemical performance of the solid composite electrolyte can be considerably improved by tuning the concentration and morphology of TiO2. Additionally, tests performed with the self-standing LiFePO4 catholyte underline a good cyclability of the system, thus confirming the beneficial effects provided by the novel manufacturing path used for the preparation of self-standing electrodes.},

ABSTRACT = {By virtue of the high theoretical energy density and low cost, Lithium–sulfur (Li-S) batteries have drawn widespread attention. However, their electrochemical performances are seriously plagued by the shuttling of intermediate polysulfides and the slow reaction kinetics during practical implementation. Herein, we designed a freestanding flexible membrane composed of nitrogen-doped porous carbon nanofibers anchoring iron and zinc single atoms (FeZn-PCNF), to serve as the polysulfide barrier and the reaction promotor. The flexible porous networks formed by the interwoven carbon nanofibers not only offer fast channels for the transport of electrons/ions, but also guarantee the structural stability of the all-in-one multifunctional interlayer during cycling. Highly dispersed Fe and Zn atoms in the carbon scaffold synergistically immobilize sulfur species and expedite their reversible conversion. Therefore, employing FeZn-PCNF as the freestanding interlayer between the cathode and separator, the Li-S battery delivers a superior initial reversible discharge capacity of 1140 mA h g−1 at a current density of 0.5 C and retains a high capacity of 618 mA h g−1 after 600 cycles at a high current density of 1 C.},

This study demonstrates a two-step synthesis technique and highlights the enhanced energy storage efficiency of ZnS-NiS2 composite materials for asymmetric supercapacitors. The composite materials of ZnS nanosheets and NiS2 nanocrystals are characterized by a rough surface and spherical shape. The sample with the optimal ratio (ZnS-NiS2-1:7) exhibits a maximum specific capacitance of 1467.9 F g−1 (550.5 C g−1) at 1 A g−1. The specific capacitance of the ZnS-NiS2-1:7 sample is 26.1% higher compared to the pure NiS2 sample. Furthermore, the assembled ZnS-NiS2-1:7//AC device shows a high specific capacitance of 127.8 F g−1 (217.3 C g−1) at 1 A g−1 and an energy density of 51.3 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 820.8 W kg−1. The ZnS-NiS2-1:7 sample has exceptional energy storage capability on its own, but it can also be composited with graphene to further increase the specific capacitance (1681.0 F g−1 at 1 A g−1), suggesting promising prospects for the ZnS-NiS2-based composite material in the future.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper presents operation and control systems for a new modular on-board charger (OBC) based on a SEPIC converter (MSOBC) for electric vehicle (EV) applications. The MSOBC aims to modularise the battery units in the energy storage system of the EV to provide better safety and improved operation. This is mainly achieved by reducing the voltage of the battery packs without sacrificing the performance required by the HV system. The proposed MSOBC is an integrated OBC which can operate the EV during traction and braking, as well as charge the battery units. The MSOBC is composed of several submodules consisting of a full-bridge voltage source converter connected on the ac side and SEPIC converter installed on the battery side. The SEPIC converter controls the battery segments with a continuous current because it has an input inductor which can smooth the battery’s currents without the need for large electrolytic capacitors. The isolated version of the SEPIC converter is employed to enhance the system’s safety by providing galvanic isolation between the batteries and the ac output side. This paper presents the necessary control loops to ensure the optimal operation of the EV with the MSOBC in terms of charge and temperature balance without disturbing the required modes of operation. The mathematical analyses in this paper are validated using a full-scale EV controlled by TMS320F28335 DSP.},

ABSTRACT = {The integration of renewable resources in isolated systems can produce instability in the electrical grid due to its intermintency. In today’s microgrids, which lack synchronous generation, physical inertia is substituted for inertia emulation. To date, the most effective approach remains the frequency derivative control technique. Nevertheless, within this method, the ability to provide virtual drooping is often disregarded in its design, potentially leading to inadequate development in systems featuring high renewable penetration and low damping. To address this issue, this paper introduces an innovative design and analysis of virtual inertia control to simultaneously mimic droop and inertia characteristics in microgrids. The dynamic frequency response without and with renewable energy sources penetration is comparatively analyzed by simulation. The proposed virtual inertia control employs a derivative technique to measure the rate of change of frequency slope during inertia emulation. Sensitivity mapping is conducted to scrutinize its impact on dynamic frequency response. Finally, the physical battery storage system of the University of Cuenca microgrid is used as a case study under operating conditions.},

ABSTRACT = {Predicting the core temperature of a Li-ion battery is crucial for precise state estimation, but it is difficult to directly measure. Existing quick temperature-predicting approaches can hardly consider the thermal mass of complex structure that may cause time delays, particularly under high C-rate dynamic conditions. In this paper, we developed a quick temperature prediction algorithm based on a thermal convolution method (TCM) to calculate the core temperature of a flat heat pipe-based battery thermal management system (FHP-BTMS) under dynamic conditions. The model could predict the core temperature rapidly through convolution of the thermal response map which contains full physical information. Firstly, in order to obtain a high fidelity spatio-temporal temperature distribution, the thermal capacitance-resistance network (TCRN) of the FHP-BTMS is established and validated by constant and dynamic discharging experiments. Then, the response map of the core temperature motivated by various impulse heat sources and heat sinks is obtained. Specifically, the dynamic thermal characteristics of an FHP are discussed to correct the boundary conditions of the TCM. Afterwards, the temperature prediction performances of the TCM and a lumped model under different step operating conditions are compared. The TCM results show a 70–80% accuracy improvement and better dynamic adaptivity than the lumped model. Lastly, a vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) profile is employed. The temperature prediction accuracy results show that the TCM can maintain a relative error below 5% throughout the entire prediction period.},

ABSTRACT = {Macro-scale mechanical testing and finite element analysis of lithium metal in compression have been shown to suggest methods and parameters for producing thin lithium anodes. Consideration of engineering and geometrically corrected stress experiments shows that the increasing contact area dominates the stress increase observed during the compression, not strain hardening, of lithium. Under static loading, the lithium metal stress relaxes, which means there is a speed of deformation (engineering strainrate limit of 6.4×10−5 s−1) where there is no increase in stress during compression. Constant displacement tests show that stress relaxation depends on the initial applied stress and the amount of athermal plastic work within the material. The finite element analysis shows that barrelling during compression and the requirement for high applied stresses to compress lithium with a small height-to-width ratio are friction and geometric effects, respectively. The outcomes of this work are discussed in relation to the diminishing returns of stack pressure, the difficulty in closing voids, and potential methods for designing and producing sub-micron lithium anodes.},

ABSTRACT = {Over the past years, lithium-ion solid-state batteries have demonstrated significant advancements regarding such properties as safety, long-term endurance, and energy density. Solid-state electrolytes based on lithium halides offer new opportunities due to their unique features such as a broad electrochemical stability window, high lithium-ion conductivity, and elasticity at close to melting point temperatures that could enhance lithium-ion transport at interfaces. A comparative study of lithium indium halide (Li3InCl6) electrolytes synthesized through a mechano-thermal method with varying optimization parameters revealed a significant effect of temperature and pressure on lithium-ion transport. An analysis of Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) data within the temperature range of 25–100 °C revealed that the optimized Li3InCl6 electrolyte reveals high ionic conductivity, reaching 1.0 mS cm−1 at room temperature. Herein, we present the utilization of in situ/operando X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) and in situ X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) to investigate the temperature-dependent behavior of the Li3InCl6 electrolyte. Confirmed by these methods, significant changes in the Li3InCl6 ionic conductivity at 70 °C were observed due to phase transformation. The observed behavior provides critical information for practical applications of the Li3InCl6 solid-state electrolyte in a broad temperature range, contributing to the enhancement of lithium-ion solid-state batteries through their improved morphology, chemical interactions, and structural integrity.},

ABSTRACT = {This article explores the novel application of a trained artificial neural network (ANN) in the prediction of vanadium redox flow battery behaviour and compares its performance with that of a two-dimensional numerical model. The aim is to evaluate the capability of two ANNs, one for predicting the cell potential and one for the overpotential under various operating conditions. The two-dimensional model, previously validated with experimental data, was used to generate data to train and test the ANNs. The results show that the first ANN precisely predicts the cell voltage under different states of charge and current density conditions in both the charge and discharge modes. The second ANN, which is responsible for the overpotential calculation, can accurately predict the overpotential across the cell domains, with the lowest confidence near high-gradient areas such as the electrode membrane and domain boundaries. Furthermore, the computational time is substantially reduced, making ANNs a suitable option for the fast understanding and optimisation of VRFBs.},

ABSTRACT = {Recently, potassium-ion batteries (KIBs) have attracted significant interest due to a number of factors, including the growing demand for energy and limited lithium resources. However, their practical use is hampered by poor cycling stability due to the large size of K+. Therefore, it is critical to develop a structural design that effectively suppresses large volume changes. This study presents a simple method of using a salt template to fabricate porous microspheres (p-MoSe2@C MS) of MoSe2 and a carbon matrix as anode materials in KIBs. These microspheres have a distinct porous design, with uniformly distributed MoSe2 nanocrystals embedded in the carbon matrix to prevent MoSe2 overgrowth due to material diffusion during heat treatment. The manufacturing process combined one-step spray drying with recyclable NaCl as a hard template. Through a two-step thermal process under an inert atmosphere, the initial dextrin, NaCl, and Mo salt microspheres were converted into a p-MoSe2@N MS composite. The carbon structure derived from the dextrin maintained the shape of the microspheres when NaCl was removed, ensuring no overgrowth of MoSe2. This well-designed porous structure improves the interaction with the electrolyte, facilitating the transport of ions and electrons and reducing the K+ diffusion distances. In addition, the porous carbon structure accommodates large volume changes during cycling and maintains its structural strength. As a result, p-MoSe2@C MS composite exhibits superior electrochemical properties, with remarkable capacity, long-term cycling stability (193 mA h g−1 after 500 cycles at 2.0 A g−1), and rate capability.},

ABSTRACT = {The health assessment of lithium-ion batteries holds great research significance in various areas such as battery management systems, battery usage and maintenance, and battery economic evaluation. However, because environmental perturbations are not taken into account during the assessment, the accuracy and reliability of the assessment are limited. Thus, a health assessment model for lithium-ion batteries based on evidence reasoning rules with dynamic reference value (ER-DRV) is proposed in this paper. Firstly, considering that the data are subject to changes, dynamic reference values, real-time weights, and real-time reliability were utilized in the model to ensure the effectiveness and accuracy of the assessment. Moreover, an enhanced optimization method based on the whale optimization algorithm (WOA) was developed to improve the accuracy of the assessment model. In addition, the robustness of the ER-DRV model was studied with perturbation analysis methods. Finally, the proposed method was validated on two open lithium-ion battery datasets. The experimental results show that the health assessment method proposed in this article not only has higher accuracy and transparent reasoning process but also has strong robustness and good generalization ability.},

ABSTRACT = {The selective separation of lithium from spent ternary positive materials is achieved through hydrogen reduction followed by water leaching. Almost 98% of the Li is transformed into soluble LiOH⋅H2O, while the Ni, Co and Mn species are all transformed into insoluble metals or their oxides, so the recovery of Ni, Co and Mn at this stage is challenging. The traditional acid leaching process has drawbacks such as high oxidant consumption, the low recovery of valuable metals and high production costs. Thus, sulfation roasting followed by water leaching was studied in this project. The leaching levels of Ni, Co, Mn and Al reached 87.13%, 99.87%, 96.21% and 94.95%, respectively, with 1.4 times the theoretical amount of sulfuric acid used at 180 °C for 120 min. To avoid the adverse effects of Mn and Al on the quality of the Ni and Co sulfate products, Mn2+ was first separated and precipitated via the KMnO4 oxidation–precipitation method, and >98% of the Mn was removed and precipitated within 30 min with a Kp/Kt (ratio of actual usage to theoretical usage of KMnO4) of 1.0 at pH = 2.0 and 25 °C. After removal of the Mn, the solvent extraction method was adopted by using P204 as an extractant to separate Al. More than 98% of the Al was extracted in 30 min with 20% (v/v) P204 + 10% (v/v) TBP with an A/O ratio of 1:1 at 30 °C. This optimized process for extracting lithium residues improved the hydrogen reduction process of waste lithium batteries and will enable industrialization of the developed processes.},

ABSTRACT = {The problem of lithium dendrite growth has persistently hindered the advancement of lithium metal batteries. Lithium phosphorus oxynitride (LiPON), functioning as an amorphous solid electrolyte, is extensively employed as an artificial solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) owing to its remarkable stability and mechanical strength, which is beneficial for effectively mitigating dendrite growth. Nevertheless, the significant challenge arises from the volume changes in the Li metal anode during cycling, leading to the vulnerability of LiPON due to its high rigidity, which impedes the widespread use of LiPON. To address this problem, our study introduces a lithium-boron (Li-B) alloy as the anode, featuring a 3D structure, which can be synergistic with the artificial LiPON layer during cycling, leading to a better performance. The average Coulombic efficiency (CE) of a Li || Cu half-cell reaches 95% over 120 cycles. The symmetric cells exhibit sustained operation for 950 h with a low voltage polarization of less than 20 mV under a current density of 0.5 mA/cm2 and for 410 h under 1 mA/cm2.},

Secondly, by integrating the cell thermal runaway model and considering the three-dimensional structure of the battery module, a comprehensive thermal runaway propagation model is developed and validated. Subsequently, a simulation study on thermal runaway propagation, incorporating multi-factor influences and typical operating conditions, is conducted using the established thermal propagation model for the battery module. The study elucidates the thermal runaway propagation characteristics of the battery module under different safety protection strategies. The findings highlight that the proposed safety protection strategy effectively mitigates thermal propagation within the battery module, particularly when the thermal runaway is influenced by multiple factors.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper introduces a novel hybrid thermal management strategy, which uses secondary coolants (air and fluid) to extract heat from a phase change material (paraffin), resulting in an increase in the phase change material’s heat extraction capability and the battery module’s overall thermal performance. A novel cold plate design is developed and placed between the rows and columns of the cells. The cold plate contains a single fluid body to improve the thermal performance of the battery module. Experimental studies were conducted to obtain the temperature and heat flux profiles of the battery module. Moreover, a numerical model is developed and validated using the experimental data obtained. The numerical data stayed within ±2% of the experimental data. In addition, the ability of nanoparticles to increase the thermal conductivity of water is examined and it is found that the cooling from the liquid cooling component is not sensitive enough to capture the 0.32 W/m K increase in the thermal conductivity of the fluid. Furthermore, in order to enhance the air cooling, fins were added within the air duct to the cold plate. However, this is not feasible, as the pressure drop through the addition of the fins increased by ~245%, whereas the maximum temperature of the battery module reduced by only 0.6 K. Finally, when scaled up to an entire battery pack at a high discharge rate of 7 C, the numerical results showed that the overall temperature uniformity across the pack was 1.14 K, with a maximum temperature of 302.6 K, which was within the optimal operating temperature and uniformity ranges. Therefore, the developed thermal management strategy eliminates the requirement of a pump and reservoir and can be scaled up or down according to the energy and power requirements.},

Although this topic has been the subject of numerous studies over the last ten years, there are still gaps to be filled, particularly with regard to the mix of different recharging strategies (normal, accelerated, fast, induction-track, etc.), as well as the economic and operational aspects. Moreover, the relationship between users and private cars is changing rapidly, and charging behaviors are not yet well established.},

ABSTRACT = {Cost-effective bismuth (Bi) boasts a high theoretical capacity and exceptional selectivity towards Cl- ion storage, making it a promising material for desalination batteries (DBs). However, the substantial volume expansion and low conductivity severely hinder the cycling performance of Bi-based DBs. In this study, a carbon-layer-coated Bi nanocomposite (Bi@C) was synthesized by pyrolyzing a metal–organic framework (Bi-MOF) containing Bi using a straightforward method. The results show that the Bi@C synthesized under the condition of annealing at 700 °C for 2 h has the optimum properties. The Bi@C has good multiplication performance, and the desalination capacity is 106.1 mg/g at a high current density of 1000 mA/g. And the material exhibited a high desalination capacity of 141.9 mg/g at a current density of 500 mA/g and retained 66.9% of its capacity after 200 cycles. In addition, the Bi@C can operate at a wide range of NaCl concentrations from 0.05 to 2 mol/L. The desalination mechanism analysis of the Bi@C revealed that the carbon coating provides space for Bi particles to expand in volume, thereby mitigating the issues of electrode material powdering and shedding. Meanwhile, the porous carbon skeleton establishes electron and ion channels to enhance the electrode material’s conductivity. This research offers a promising strategy for the application of chloride-storage electrode materials in electrochemical desalination systems.},

ABSTRACT = {In an effort to tackle climate change, various sectors, including the transport sector, are turning towards increased electrification. As a result, there has been a swift increase in the sales of electric vehicles (EVs) that use lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). When LIBs reach their end of life in EVs, it may still be possible to use them in other, less demanding applications, giving them a second life. This article describes a case study where the feasibility of a hypothetical business repurposing Tesla Model S/X batteries in the Ostrobothnia region, Finland, is investigated. A material-flow analysis is conducted to estimate the number of batteries becoming available for second-life applications from both the Ostrobothnia region and Finland up to 2035. The cost of repurposing batteries is evaluated for four different scenarios, with the batteries being processed either on the pack, module, or cell level. Three scenarios were found to be feasible, with repurposing costs of 27.2–38.3 EUR/kWh. The last scenario, in which all battery packs are disassembled at the cell level, was found not to be feasible due to the labor intensiveness of disassembly and testing at the cell level. This work gives indications of the potential for repurposing batteries in the Ostrobothnia region and Finland.},

ABSTRACT = {The ongoing transition toward electric vehicles is a major factor in the exponential rise in demand for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). There is a significant effort to recycle battery materials to support the mining industry in ensuring enough raw materials and avoiding supply disruptions, so that there will be enough raw materials to produce LIBs. Nevertheless, LIBs that have reached the end of their useful lives and are sent for recycling may still have some energy left in them, which could be dangerous during handling and processing. Therefore, it is important to conduct discharge pretreatment of LIBs before dismantling and crushing them, especially in cases where pyrometallurgical recycling is not used. Electrochemical discharge in conducting solutions has been commonly studied and implemented for this purpose, but its effectiveness has yet to be fully validated. Non-electrochemical discharge has also been researched as a potentially cleaner and more efficient discharge technology at the same time. This article presents a non-electrochemical discharge process by completely draining the energy from used batteries before recycling. A comprehensive investigation of the behavior of LIBs during discharge and the amount of energy remaining after fully discharging the battery at different temperatures is analyzed in this work. According to the experimental findings, completely discharging the battery at higher temperatures results in a reduced amount of residual energy in the battery. This outcome holds great importance in terms of safe and environmentally friendly recycling of used LIBs, emphasizing that safety and environmentally friendly recycling must go hand in hand with a cost-effective and sustainable solution.},

ABSTRACT = {Current research focuses on lithium-ion battery cells with a high energy density and efficient fast-charging capabilities. However, transport limitations, and, therefore, the uniform diffusion of lithium-ions across the electrode layers, remain a challenge and could lead to reduced cell performance. One approach to overcome these transport challenges is the use of subsequently produced two-layer anodes with the particle size variation of spherical graphite (x50 = 18 µm; x50 = 11 µm). Thereby, a defined pore network is created, which reduces the ionic resistance and ensuring improved fast charging capabilities. The analysis focuses on the evaluation of electrode properties and the electrochemical performance. By examining the pore size distribution of the anodes, it has been found that during the manufacturing of the two-layer anodes, carbon black and binder particles are transported into the existing microstructure of the lower layer, resulting in localized densification between the anode layers. This could also be supported by color measurements. This effect also extends to electrochemical investigations, with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy showing significantly lower ionic resistances in all two-layer anodes. Reduced ionic resistance and tortuosity near the separator due to absorption effects enhance the ion diffusion and have a direct impact on anode performance. Cell ageing analysis showed a significant capacity decrease of almost 15 mAh g −1 in the single-layer references only, in contrast to the stability of the two-layer anodes. This could also be attributed to the reduced ionic resistance and active counteraction of binder migration. In conclusion, this study highlights how subsequently produced two-layer anodes significantly shape the electrode properties and cell performance of lithium-ion batteries.},

ABSTRACT = {The temperature of a lithium-ion battery is a crucial parameter for understanding the internal processes during various operating and failure scenarios, including thermal runaway. However, the internal temperature is comparatively higher than the surface temperature. This particularly affects cells with a large cross-section, which is due to heat development within the cell and lower heat dissipation due to a poorer ratio of volume to surface area. This paper presents an approach that enables real-time monitoring of the behavior of a commercial prismatic high-energy battery cell (NMC811/C, 95 Ah, Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., Limited (Ningde, China)) in the event of thermal runaway induced by overcharging. The internal cell temperature is investigated by the subsequent integration of two hard sensors between the two jelly rolls and additional sensors on the surface of the aluminum housing of the battery cell. The sensor’s signals show a significant increase in the temperature gradient between the temperature in the core of the cell and the cell casing surface until the onset of venting and thermal runaway of the battery. The data enable a detailed investigation of the behavior of the battery cell and the comparatively earlier detection of the point of no return in the event of thermal runaway.},

ABSTRACT = {The intermittent nature of power generation from photovoltaics (PV) requires reliable energy storage solutions. Using the storage system outdoors exposes it to variable temperatures, affecting both its storage capacity and lifespan. Utilizing and optimizing energy storage considering climatic variations and new storage technologies is still a research gap. Therefore, this paper presents a modified sizing algorithm based on the Golden Section Search method, aimed at optimizing the number of cells in an energy storage unit, with a specific focus on the unique conditions of Denmark. The considered energy storage solutions are Lithium-ion capacitors (LiCs) and Lithium-ion batteries (LiBs), which are tested under different temperatures and C-rates rates. The algorithm aims to maximize the number of autonomy cycles—defined as periods during which the system operates independently of the grid, marked by intervals between two consecutive 0% State of Charge (SoC) occurrences. Testing scenarios include dynamic temperature and dynamic load, constant temperature at 25 °C, and constant load, considering irradiation and temperature effects and cell capacity fading over a decade. A comparative analysis reveals that, on average, the LiC storage is sized at 70–80% of the LiB storage across various scenarios. Notably, under a constant-temperature scenario, the degradation rate accelerates, particularly for LiBs. By leveraging the modified Golden Section Search algorithm, this study provides an efficient approach to the sizing problem, optimizing the number of cells and thus offering a potential solution for energy storage in off-grid PV systems.},

The article focuses on battery analyses based on operational data obtained from measurements rather than analyses of the chemical composition of the tested batteries. The authors of the article used their experience from the development test-laboratory of military technology. This article presents a comparative analysis of existing and promising technologies in the field of energy storage and buffering for military electric vehicles. The overview of these technologies, including the design, operating principles, advantages, and disadvantages, are briefly presented to produce theoretical comparative analyses.

ABSTRACT = {Due to their high specific capacity and long cycle life, bimetallic sulfides are the preferred choice of researchers as anodes in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, studies indicate that this class of materials often requires expensive elements such as Co, Sb, Sn, etc., and their performance is insufficient with the use of inexpensive Fe, V alone. Therefore, there is a need to explore the relationship between metal cations and anode performance so that the requirements of cost reduction and performance enhancement can be met simultaneously. In this work, a series of partially replaced sulfides with different cation ratios have been prepared by a hydrothermal method followed by heat treatment. By partially replacing Co in NiCo sulfides, all samples show improved capacity and stability over the original NiCo sulfides. As a result, the metal elements have different oxidation states, which leads to a higher capacity through their synergistic effects on each other. Mn-NiCoS with 10% replacement showed satisfactory capacity (721.09 mAh g−1 at 300 mA g−1, 662.58 mAh g−1 after 20 cycles) and excellent cycle life (85.41% capacity retention after 1000 cycles at 2000 mA g−1).},

ABSTRACT = {The viscosity and microstructure of Li-ion battery slurries and the performance of the resulting electrodes have been shown to depend on the mixing protocol. This work applies rheology to understand the impact of shear during mixing and polymer molecular weight on slurry microstructure and electrode performance. Mixing protocols of different shear intensity are applied to slurries of LiNi0.33Mn0.33Co0.33O2 (NMC), carbon black (CB), and polyvinyldiene difluoride (PVDF) in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP), using both high-molecular-weight (HMW) and low-molecular-weight (LMW) PVDF. Slurries of both polymers are observed to form colloidal gels under high-shear mixing, even though unfavorable interactions between high molecular weight PVDF and CB should prevent this microstructure from forming. Theoretical analysis and experimental results show that increasing shear rate during the polymer and particle mixing steps causes polymer scission to decrease the polymer molecular weight and allow colloidal gelation. In general, electrodes made from high molecular weight PVDF generally show increased rate capability. However, high shear rates lead to increased cell variability, possibly due to the heterogeneities introduced by polymer scission.},

ABSTRACT = {GeFe2O4 (GFO), with its intriguing intercalation mechanism based on alloying–conversion reactions, was recently proposed as an anode material for sodium ion batteries (SIBs). However, drawbacks related to excessive volume expansion during intercalation/deintercalation and poor electronic conductivity enormously hinder its practical application in batteries. In this regard, some experimental strategies such as cation substitutions and proper architectures/carbon coatings can be adopted. In this paper, pure and Mn-doped GFO samples were prepared by hydrothermal synthesis. The doped samples maintained the spinel cubic structure and the morphology of pure GFO. The electrochemical tests of the samples, performed after proper carbon coating, showed the expected redox processes involving both Ge and Fe ions. The Mn doping had a positive effect on the capacity values at a low current density (about 350 mAh/g at C/5 for the Mn 5% doping in comparison to 300 mAh/g for the pure sample). Concerning the cycling stability, the doped samples were able to provide 129 mAh/g (Mn 10%) and 150 mAh/g (Mn 5%) at C/10 after 60 cycles.},

ABSTRACT = {Recent advancements in energy conversion and storage systems have placed a spotlight on the role of multi-functional electrodes employing conductive substrates. These substrates, however, often face obstacles due to intricate and expensive production methods, as well as limitations in thickness. This research introduces a novel, economical approach using graphite felt as a versatile electrode. A method to enhance the typically low conductivity of graphite felt was devised, incorporating interfacial chemical tuning and the electrodeposition of a highly conductive nickel layer. This technique facilitates the integration of diverse transition metal-based active sites, aiming to refine the catalytic activity for specific electrochemical reactions. A key finding is that a combination of a nickel-rich cathode and an iron-rich anode can effectively optimize alkaline water electrolysis for hydrogen production at the ampere scale. Furthermore, the addition of sulfur improves the bi-functional oxygen-related redox reactions, rendering it ideal for air cathodes in solid-state zinc–air batteries. The assembled battery exhibits impressive performance, including a peak power density of 62.9 mW cm−2, a minimal voltage gap in discharge–charge polarization, and a lifecycle surpassing 70 h. This advancement in electrode technology signifies a significant leap in energy storage and conversion, offering a sustainable and efficient solution for future energy systems.},

ABSTRACT = {The market for electric vehicles (EVs) has been growing in popularity, and by 2027, it is predicted that the market valuation will reach $869 billion. To support the growth of EVs in public road safety, advances in battery safety research for EV application should achieve low-cost, lightweight, and high safety protection. In this research, the development of a lightweight, crashworthy battery protection system using an excellent energy absorption capability is carried out. The lightweight structure was developed by using metastructure constructions with an arrangement of repeated lattice cellular structures. Three metastructure configurations (bi-stable, star-shaped, double-U) with their geometrical variables (thickness, inner spacing, cell stack) and material types (stainless steel, aluminium, and carbon steel) were evaluated until the maximum Specific Energy Absorptions (SEA) value was attained. The Finite Element Method (FEM) is utilised to simulate the mechanics of impact and calculate the optimum SEA of the various designs using machine learning methodology. Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) was used to derive the design variation by dividing the variables into 100 samples. The machine learning optimisation method utilises the Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II) to forecast the design that produces maximum SEA. The optimum control variables are star-shaped cells consisting of one vertical unit cell using aluminium material with a cross-section thickness of 2.9 mm. The optimum design increased the SEA by 5577% compared to the baseline design. The accuracy of the machine learning prediction is also verified using numerical simulation with a 2.83% error. Four different sandwich structure configurations are then constructed using the optimal geometry for prismatic battery protection subjected to ground impact loading conditions. An optimum configuration of 6×4×1 core cells arrangement results in a maximum displacement of 7.33 mm for the prismatic battery in the ground impact simulation, which is still less than the deformation threshold for prismatic battery safety of 10.423 mm. It is shown that the lightweight metastructure is very efficient for prismatic battery protection subjected to ground impact loading conditions.},

ABSTRACT = {Severe volumetric expansion (~400%) limits practical application of silicon nanoparticles as anode materials for next-generation lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). Here, we describe the fabrication and characterization of a conformal polydopamine carbon shell encapsulating rattle-type silica@silicon nanoparticles (PDA–PEI@PVP–SiO2@Si) with a tunable void structure using a dual template strategy with TEOS and (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES) pretreated with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP K30) as SiO2 sacrificial template via a modified Stöber process. Polyethylene imine (PEI) crosslinking facilitated the construction of an interconnected three-dimensional bubble wrap-like carbon matrix structure through hydrothermal treatment, pyrolysis, and subsequent surface-protected etching. The composite anode material delivered satisfactory capacities of 539 mAh g−1 after 100 cycles at 0.1 A g−1, 512.76 mAh g−1 after 200 cycles at 1 A g−1, and 453 mAh g−1 rate performance at 5 A g−1, respectively. The electrochemical performance of PDA–PEI@PVP–SiO2@Si was attributed to the rattle-type structure providing void space for Si volume expansion, PVP K30-pretreated APTES/TEOS SiO2 seeds via catalyst-free, hydrothermal-assisted Stöber protecting Si/C spheres upon etching, carbon coating strategy increasing Si conductivity while stabilizing the solid electrolyte interface (SEI), and PEI carbon crosslinks providing continuous conductive pathways across the electrode structure. The present work describes a promising strategy to synthesize tunable yolk shell C@void@Si composite anode materials for high power/energy-density LIBs applications.},

ABSTRACT = {When designing the battery of an electric vehicle, different parameters must be considered to obtain the safest arrangement of the battery/modules/cells from the mechanical and thermal points of view. In this study, the thermal runaway propagation mechanism of lithium-ion cells is analyzed as a function of their arrangement within a battery pack in case of a fire propagation of a battery pack in which a thermal runaway has occurred. The objective is to identify which cell/module arrangement is most critical within the battery pack, using microscopic analysis of the structure and chemical composition of the most damaged cells, both horizontally and vertically, of a battery belonging to a burnt vehicle. And their final condition was compared with the condition of new cells of the same type. In this way, the structure and chemical composition of the cathode, anode, and separator after thermal runaway were compared. This research was carried out to obtain information to understand the mechanical properties of lithium-ion cells and their behavior after thermal runaway heating leading to the propagation of a fire. Through the analysis carried out, it is concluded that cells placed in a vertical arrangement have worse behavior than cells in a horizontal arrangement. Regarding the safety of the battery, the results of this study will allow us to determine which arrangement and structure of the cells in the battery pack is safer against thermal runaway due to thermal failure.},

ABSTRACT = {Lithium–ion batteries are well established as traction batteries for electric vehicles. This has led to a growing market for second-life batteries that can be used in applications like home energy storage systems. Moreover, the recyclability and safe handling of aged or damaged cells and packs has become more important. While there are several indicators, like state of health (SOH), state of power (SOP), or state of safety (SOS), which describe the state of a battery before its defined end of life (EOL), there is no consistent classification methodology by which to describe the usability of a cell or pack after its EOL is reached. The proposed state of usability (SOU) provides a new indicator that accounts for the usability for second life, recyclability, and possible required safety handling of a lithium–ion battery after its first intended life cycle. This work presents a decision tree method, which in turn leads to five discrete usability levels enabling a fast and rough determination of the SOU for practical use. Further, a calculation methodology for reasonable continuous regions of the SOU is proposed. Both methods are based on a literature-based rating of all of the relevant defect and aging mechanisms displayed in a risk matrix. Finally, some experimental methods that can be used for SOU determination are proposed. The developed methodology and the hands-on approach using a decision tree are well-suited for real world application in recycling companies and battery test laboratories.},

ABSTRACT = {An increase in the energy density on the cell level while maintaining a high power density can be realized by combining thick-film electrodes and the 3D battery concept. The effect of laser structuring using different pattern types on the electrochemical performance was studied. For this purpose, LiNi0.6Mn0.2Co0.2O2 (NMC 622) thick-film cathodes were prepared with a PVDF binder and were afterward structured using ultrafast laser ablation. Eight different pattern types were realized, which are lines, grids, holes, hexagonal structures, and their respective combinations. In addition, the mass loss caused by laser ablation was kept the same regardless of the pattern type. The laser-structured electrodes were assembled in coin cells and subsequently electrochemically characterized. It was found that when discharging the cells for durations of less than 2 h, a significant, positive impact of laser patterning on the electrochemical cell performance was observed. For example, when discharging was performed for one hour, cells containing laser-patterned electrodes with different structure types exhibited a specific capacity increase of up to 70 mAh/g in contrast to the reference ones. Although cells with a hole-patterned electrode exhibited a minimum capacity increase in the rate capability analysis, the combination of holes with lines, grids, or hexagons led to further capacity increases. In addition, long-term cycle analyses demonstrated the benefits of laser patterning on the cell lifetime, while cyclic voltammetry highlighted an increase in the Li-ion diffusion kinetics in cells containing hexagonal-patterned electrodes.},

ABSTRACT = {With an increase in global warming, battery electric vehicles (BEVs), which are environmentally friendly, have been rapidly commercialized to replace conventional vehicles with internal combustion engines. Unlike traditional internal combustion engine vehicles, the powertrain system of BEVs operates with high efficiency, resulting in lower heat generation. This poses a challenge for cabin heating under low-temperature conditions. Conversely, under high-temperature conditions, the operating temperature of a high-voltage battery (HVB) is lower than the ambient air temperature, which makes cooling through ambient air challenging. To overcome these challenges, in this study, we proposed an integrated thermal management system (ITMS) based on a heat pump system capable of stable thermal management under diverse climatic conditions. Furthermore, to assess the ability of the proposed ITMS to perform thermal management under various climatic conditions, we integrated a detailed powertrain system model incorporating BEV specifications and the proposed ITMS model based on the heat pump system. The ITMS model was evaluated under high-load-driving conditions, specifically the HWFET scenario, demonstrating its capability to perform stable thermal management not only under high-temperature conditions, such as at 36 °C, but also under low-temperature conditions, such as at −10 °C, through the designated thermal management modes.},

ABSTRACT = {Reducing greenhouse emissions can be done via the electrification of the transport industry. However, there are challenges related to the electrification such as the lifetime of vehicle batteries as well as limitations on the charging possibilities. To cope with some of these challenges, a charge scheduling method for fleets of electric vehicles is presented. Such a method assigns the charging moments (i.e., schedules) of fleets that have more vehicles than chargers. While doing the assignation, the method also maximizes the total Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of all the vehicle batteries. The method consists of two optimization algorithms. The first optimization algorithm determines charging profiles (i.e., charging current vs time) for individual vehicles. The second algorithm finds the charging schedule (i.e., the order in which vehicles are connected to a charger) that maximizes the RUL in the batteries of the entire fleet. To reduce the computational effort of predicting the battery RUL, the method uses a Machine Learning (ML) model. Such a model predicts the RUL of an individual battery while taking into account common stress factors and fabrication-related differences per battery. Simulation results show that charging a single vehicle as late as possible maximizes the RUL of that single vehicle, due to the lower battery degradation. Simulations also show that the ML model accurately predicts the RUL, while taking into account fabrication-related variability in the battery. Additionally, it was shown that this method schedules the charging moments of a fleet, leading to an increased total RUL of all the batteries in the vehicle fleet.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, a high-efficiency and low-cost active cell-to-cell balancing circuit for the reuse of electric vehicle (EV) batteries is proposed. In the proposed method, a battery string is divided into two legs to transfer the charge from each cell in one leg to that in the other and a bidirectional CLLC resonant converter is used to transfer energy between the selected cells. Thanks to the proposed structure, the number of bidirectional switches and gate drivers can be reduced by half compared to the conventional direct cell-to-cell topologies, thereby achieving lower cost for the system. The CLLC converter is used to transfer the charge, and it is designed to work at resonant frequencies to achieve zero-voltage zero-current switching (ZVZCS) for all the switches and diodes. Consequently, the system’s efficiency can be enhanced, and hence, the fuel economy of the system can also be improved significantly. To verify the performance of the proposed active cell-balancing system, a prototype is implemented for balancing the three EV battery modules that contain twelve lithium-ion batteries from xEV. The maximum efficiency achieved for the charge transfer is 89.4%, and the balancing efficiency is 96.3%.},

Much of the industry’s efforts are aimed at reducing the high energy consumption in battery cell production.

Several drying technologies from other industries could reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions if successfully applied to battery cell production. High process and quality requirements must be met when adapting these technologies for battery cell production. Evaluating the technologies against these requirements is difficult due to the technological novelty of this industry and the associated lack of data. Furthermore, the significant differences in drying technologies render a comparison even more challenging. One objective of this study was to evaluate drying technologies and identify those that could be best adapted to lithium-ion battery cell production. Near-infrared and laser drying were found to be the best in terms of energy efficiency, cost savings and other parameters. Another aim was to analyse, in more detail, the technological challenges and the advantages and disadvantages of the top-ranked drying technologies. Finally, the saving potential for greenhouse gas emissions of near-infrared and laser drying was calculated for a global production scenario of LIB cells in 2030. The saving potential in this scenario would amount to 2.63 million metric tonnes (Mt) CO2eq per year if near-infrared drying was applied in all global LIB cell production facilities within the mentioned scenario and 1.47 million Mt CO2eq per year for laser drying.},

ABSTRACT = {Developing efficient recycling processes with high recycling quotas for the recovery of graphite and other critical raw materials contained in LIBs is essential and prudent. This action holds the potential to substantially diminish the supply risk of raw materials for LIBs and enhance the sustainability of their production. An essential processing step in LIB recycling involves the thermal treatment of black mass to degrade the binder. This step is crucial as it enhances the recycling efficiency in subsequent processes, such as flotation and leaching-based processing. Therefore, this paper introduces a Representative Black Mass Model (RBMM) and develops a computational framework for the simulation of the thermal degradation of polymer-based binders in black mass (BM). The models utilize the discrete element method (DEM) with a coarse-graining (CG) scheme and the isoconversional method to predict binder degradation and the required heat. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the binder polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) is utilized to determine the model parameters. The model simulates a specific thermal treatment case on a laboratory scale and investigates the relationship between the scale factor and heating rate. The findings reveal that, for a particular BM system, a scaling factor of 100 regarding the particle diameter is applicable within a heating rate range of 2 to 22 K/min.},

ABSTRACT = {Aiming to solve the problems of insufficient dynamic responses, the large loss of energy storage life of a single power cell, and the large fluctuation in DC (direct current) bus voltage in fuel cell vessels, this study takes a certain type of fuel cell ferry as the research object and proposes an improved equivalent minimum hydrogen consumption energy management strategy, based on fuzzy logic control. First, a hybrid power system including a fuel cell, a lithium–iron–phosphate battery, and a supercapacitor is proposed, with the simulation of the power system of the modified mother ship. Second, a power system simulation model and a double-closed-loop PI (proportion integration) control model are established in MATLAB/Simulink to design the equivalent hydrogen consumption model and fuzzy logic control strategy. The simulation results show that, under the premise of meeting the load requirements, the control strategy designed in this paper improves the Li-ion battery’s power, the Li-ion battery’s SOC (state of charge), the bus voltage stability, and the equivalent hydrogen consumption significantly, compared with those before optimization, which improves the stability and economy of the power system and has certain practical engineering value.},

Experimental characterization is carried out on cylindrical cells of 21700-type, where four regimes of cell degradation are identified, which are supplemented by an increased cell resistance and surface temperature during cell operation. The amount of intercalated lithium in the fully charged anodes in the fresh and aged states is determined by ex situ X-ray diffraction radiography and in situ X-ray diffraction computed tomography. The qualitatively similar character of the results revealed a loss of active lithium along with the development of a complex heterogeneous distribution over the electrode stripe.},

ABSTRACT = {The Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) is one of the possible solutions to overcoming the non-programmability associated with these energy sources. The capabilities of BESSs to store a consistent amount of energy and to behave as a load by releasing it ensures an essential source of flexibility to the power system. Nevertheless, BESSs have some drawbacks that pose limitations to their utilization. Indeed, effectively managing the stored and released energy is crucial, considering the degradation of performance associated with these systems over time. The substantial capital expenditure (CAPEX) required to install these systems represents a current constraint, impeding their broader adoption. This work evaluates a techno-economic analysis of a 2MW/2MWh BESS providing multiple services, namely participating in capacity and balance markets. The analysis is based on a BESS model implemented in SIMULINK, adopting online data gathered from a Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP) battery facility. The model evaluates the auxiliary power consumption, state-of-charge (SoC), state of health (SoH), and the round-trip efficiency (RTE) of the overall system. The analysis is based on three price profiles: 2019 (Business-As-Usual), 2020 (COVID-19), and 2022 (Gas Crisis). Furthermore, this work conducts a case study to analyze the behavior of the BESS. It entails a sensitivity analysis, specifically evaluating the influence of CAPEX and upward bid price on the economic viability of the project. The results show a strong relation between the CAPEX variation and the Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of the project.},

ABSTRACT = {Aqueous zinc ion batteries are highly sought after for the next generation of sustainable energy storage systems. However, their development is significantly impeded by the presence of undesired zinc dendrites, which greatly reduce their cycle life. It is well-received that surface passivation by introducing foreign metals represents a compelling measure to enhance the stability of Zn anodes. Nevertheless, the vast potential of effecting concerted interplay between multiple metal elements for enhanced overall performance in Zn ion batteries remains elusive, due to the overwhelming challenge in creating uniform textures from hetero-units and understanding the mechanism underlying the synergistic performance gain. In this work, an innovative bimetallic overlaying strategy is proposed that renders possible the synergy between AgZn3 and CuZn5 in effecting uniform Zn deposition in a laterally confined and compact manner. The seeded growth of Zn on the bimetal-modulated interface effectively reduces the nucleation potential barrier, yielding a low nucleation overpotential (25 mV). In full cell testing with a commercial MnO2 applied as the cathode, superb cycling stability, surpassing the results reported in previous works, is achieved. The cell delivers an outstanding remaining capacity of 215 mA h g−1 after 300 cycles with almost no capacity degradation observed. The simple and highly efficient bimetal design, which synergizes the strengths of distinct metals, has the potential to drive innovations in the development of multicomponent aqueous Zn batteries with exceptional performance.},

ABSTRACT = {Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have been widely used for electric vehicles owing to their high energy density, light weight, and no memory effect. However, their health management problems remain unsolved in actual application. Therefore, this paper focuses on battery capacity as the key health indicator and proposes a data-driven method for capacity prediction. Specifically, this method mainly utilizes Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for automatic feature extraction from raw data and combines it with the Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) algorithm to realize the capacity prediction of LIBs. In addition, the sparrow search algorithm (SSA) is used to optimize the hyper-parameters of the neural network to further improve the prediction performance of original network structures. Ultimately, experiments with a public dataset of batteries are carried out to verify and evaluate the effectiveness of capacity prediction under two temperature conditions. The results show that the SSA-CNN-BiLSTM framework for capacity prediction of LIBs has higher accuracy compared with other original network structures during the multi-battery cycle experiments.},

ABSTRACT = {In this study, the performances of a pouch Li-ion battery (LIB) with respect to temperature, pressure and discharge-rate variation are measured. A sensitivity study has been conducted with three temperatures (5 °C, 25 °C, 45 °C), four pressures (0.2 MPa, 0.5 MPa, 0.8 MPa, 1.2 MPa) and three electrical discharge rates (0.5 C, 1.5 C, 3.0 C). Electrochemical processes and overall efficiency are significantly affected by temperature and pressure, influencing capacity and charge–discharge rates. In previous studies, temperature and pressure were not controlled simultaneously due to technological limitations. A novel test bench was developed to investigate these influences by controlling the surface temperature and mechanical pressure on a pouch LIB during electrical charging and discharging. This test rig permits an accurate assessment of mechanical, thermal and electrical parameters, while decoupling thermal and mechanical influences during electrical operation. The results of the study confirm what has been found in the literature: an increase in pressure leads to a decrease in performance, while an increase in temperature leads to an increase in performance. However, the extent to which the pressure impacts performance is determined by the temperature and the applied electrical discharge rate. At 5 °C and 0.5 C, an increase in pressure from 0.2 MPa to 1.2 MPa results in a 5.84% decrease in discharged capacity. At 45 °C the discharge capacity decreases by 2.17%. Regarding the impact of the temperature, at discharge rate of 0.5 C, with an applied pressure of 0.2 MPa, an increase in temperature from 25 °C to 45 °C results in an increase of 4.27% in discharged capacity. The impact on performance varies significantly at different C-rates. Under the same pressure (0.2 MPa) and temperature variation (from 25 °C to 45 °C), increasing the electrical discharge rate to 1.5 C results in a 43.04% increase in discharged capacity. The interplay between temperature, pressure and C-rate has a significant, non-linear impact on performance. This suggests that the characterisation of an LIB would require the active control of both temperature and pressure during electrical operation.},

ABSTRACT = {Using different fast charging strategies for lithium-ion batteries can affect the degradation rate of the batteries. In this case, predicting the capacity fade curve can facilitate the application of new batteries. Considering the impact of fast charging strategies on battery aging, a battery capacity degradation trajectory prediction method based on the TM-Seq2Seq (Trend Matching—Sequence-to-Sequence) model is proposed. This method uses data from the first 100 cycles to predict the future capacity fade curve and EOL (end of life) in one-time. First, features are extracted from the discharge voltage-capacity curve. Secondly, a sequence-to-sequence model based on CNN, SE-net, and GRU is designed. Finally, a trend matching loss function is designed based on the common characteristics of capacity fade curves to constrain the encoding features of the sequence-to-sequence model, facilitating the learning of the underlying relationship between inputs and outputs. TM-Seq2Seq model is verified on a public dataset with 132 battery cells and multiple fast charging strategies. The experimental results indicate that, compared to other popular models, the TM-Seq2Seq model has lower prediction errors.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper addresses the control of load demand and power in a battery energy storage system (BESS) with Boolean-type constraints. It employs model predictive control (MPC) tailored for such systems. However, conventional MPC encounters computational challenges in practical applications, including battery storage control, and requires dedicated, mostly licensed solvers. To mitigate this, a solver-free yet efficient, suboptimal method is proposed. This approach involves generating randomized control sequences and assessing their feasibility to ensure adherence to constraints. The sequence with the best performance index is then selected, prioritizing feasibility and safety over optimality. Although this chosen sequence may not match the exact MPC solution in terms of optimality, it guarantees safe operation. The optimal control problem for the BESS is outlined, encompassing constraints on the state of charge, power limits, and charge/discharge modes. Three distinct scenarios evaluate the proposed method. The first prioritizes minimizing computational time, yielding a feasible solution significantly faster than the optimal approach. The second scenario strikes a balance between computational efficiency and suboptimality. The third scenario aims to minimize suboptimality while accepting longer computation times. This method’s adaptability to the user’s requirements in various scenarios and solver-free evaluation underscores its potential advantages in environments marked by stringent computational demands, a characteristic often found in BESS control applications.},

ABSTRACT = {Revolutionary and cost-effective state estimation techniques are crucial for advancing lithium-ion battery technology, especially in mobile applications. Accurate prediction of battery state-of-health (SoH) enhances state-of-charge estimation while providing valuable insights into performance, second-life utility, and safety. While recent machine learning developments show promise in SoH estimation, this paper addresses two challenges. First, many existing approaches depend on predefined charge/discharge cycles with constant current/constant voltage profiles, which limits their suitability for real-world scenarios. Second, pure time series forecasting methods require prior knowledge of the battery’s lifespan in order to formulate predictions within the time series. Our novel hybrid approach overcomes these limitations by classifying the current aging state of the cell rather than tracking the SoH. This is accomplished by analyzing current pulses filtered from authentic drive cycles. Our innovative solution employs a Long Short-Term Memory-based neural network for SoH prediction based on residual capacity, making it well suited for online electric vehicle applications. By overcoming these challenges, our hybrid approach emerges as a reliable alternative for precise SoH estimation in electric vehicle batteries, marking a significant advancement in machine learning-based SoH estimation.},

This work developed a low-cost and scalable screen-printed carbon black thermocouple to study its applicability for the thermal monitoring of LIB. Given the appropriate manufacturing parameters, it was found that thermal sensors may be printed on the electrodes, installed on a pouch cell, and once calibrated, operate with excellent sensitivity. However, to reliably use a printed carbon black thermocouple in operando of a pouch cell, its chemical resistance against electrolytes was found to require further development.},

ABSTRACT = {The long-term stability of energy-storage devices for green energy has received significant attention. Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) based on materials such as metal oxides, Si, Sb, and Sn have shown superior energy density and stability owing to their intrinsic properties and the support of conductive carbon, graphene, or graphene oxides. Abnormal capacities have been recorded for some transition metal oxides, such as NiO, Fe2O3, and MnO/Mn3O4. Recently, the restructuring of NiO into LiNiO2 anode materials has yielded an ultrastable anode for LIBs. Herein, the effect of the thin film thickness on the restructuring of the NiO anode was investigated. Different electrode thicknesses required different numbers of cycles for restructuring, resulting in significant changes in the reconstituted cells. NiO thicknesses greater than 39 μm reduced the capacity to 570 mAh g−1. The results revealed the limitation of the layered thickness owing to the low diffusion efficiency of Li ions in the thick layers, resulting in non-uniformity of the restructured LiNiO2. The NiO anode with a thickness of approximately 20 μm required only 220 cycles to be restructured at 0.5 A g−1, while maintaining a high-rate performance for over 500 cycles at 1.0 A g−1, and a high capacity of 1000 mAh g−1.},

ABSTRACT = {Layered ternary materials with high nickel content are regarded as the most promising cathode materials for high-energy-density lithium-ion batteries, owing to their advantages of high capacity, low cost, and relatively good safety. However, as the nickel content increases in ternary layered materials, their thermal stability noticeably decreases. It is of paramount importance to explore the characteristics of thermal runaway for lithium-ion batteries. In this study, two high-nickel LiNi0.9Co0.05Mn0.05O2 batteries were laterally heated to thermal runaway in a sealed chamber filled with nitrogen to investigate the thermal characteristics and gas compositions. The temperature of the battery tabs was measured, revealing that both batteries were in a critical state of thermal runaway near 120 degrees Celsius. A quantitative analysis method was employed during the eruption process, dividing it into three stages: ultra-fast, fast, and slow; the corresponding durations for the two batteries were 3, 2, 27 s and 3, 3, 26 s. By comparing the changes in chamber pressure, it was observed that both batteries exhibited a similar continuous venting duration of 32 s. However, the pressure fluctuation ranges of the two samples were 99.5 and 68.2 kPa·m·s−1. Compared to the other sample, the 211 Ah sample exhibited larger chamber pressure fluctuations and reached higher peak pressures, indicating a higher risk of explosion. In the experimental phenomenon captured by a high-speed camera, it took only 1 s for the sample to transition from the opening of the safety valve to filling the experimental chamber with smoke. The battery with higher energy density exhibited more intense eruption during thermal runaway, resulting in more severe mass loss. The mass loss of the two samples is 73% and 64.87%. The electrolyte also reacted more completely, resulting in a reduced number of measured exhaust components. The main components of gaseous ejections are CO, CO2, H2, C2H4, and CH4. For the 211 Ah battery, the vented gases were mainly composed of CO (41.3%), CO2 (24.8%), H2 (21%), C2H4 (7.4%) and CH4 (3.9%), while those for the other 256 Ah battery were mainly CO (30.6%), CO2 (28.5%), H2 (21.7%), C2H4 (12.4%) and CH4 (5.8%). Comparatively, the higher-capacity battery produced more gases. The gas volumes, converted to standard conditions (0 °C, 101 kPa) and normalized, resulted in 1.985 L/Ah and 2.182 L/Ah, respectively. The results provide valuable guidance for the protection of large-capacity, high-energy-density battery systems. The quantitative analysis of the eruption process has provided assistance to fire alarm systems and firefighting strategies.},

ABSTRACT = {Maintaining batteries within a specific temperature range is vital for safety and efficiency, as extreme temperatures can degrade a battery’s performance and lifespan. In addition, battery temperature is the key parameter in battery safety regulations. Battery thermal management systems (BTMSs) are pivotal in regulating battery temperature. While current BTMSs offer real-time temperature monitoring, their lack of predictive capability poses a limitation. This study introduces a novel hybrid system that combines a machine learning-based battery temperature prediction model with an online battery parameter identification unit. The identification unit continuously updates the battery’s electrical parameters in real time, enhancing the prediction model’s accuracy. The prediction model employs an Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) and considers various input parameters, such as ambient temperature, the battery’s current temperature, internal resistance, and open-circuit voltage. The model accurately predicts the battery’s future temperature in a finite time horizon by dynamically adjusting thermal and electrical parameters based on real-time data. Experimental tests are conducted on Li-ion (NCA and LFP) cylindrical cells across a range of ambient temperatures to validate the system’s accuracy under varying conditions, including state of charge and a dynamic load current. The proposed models prioritise simplicity to ensure real-time industrial applicability.},

ABSTRACT = {Thermal runaway (TR) of lithium-ion batteries has always been a topic of concern, and the safety of batteries is closely related to the operating temperature. An overheated battery can significantly impact the surrounding batteries, increasing the risk of fire and explosion. To improve the safety of battery modules and prevent TR, we focus on the characteristics of temperature distribution and thermal spread of battery modules under overheating conditions. The heat transfer characteristics of battery modules under different battery thermal management systems (BTMSs) are assessed. In addition, the effects of abnormal heat generation rate, abnormal heat generation location, and ambient temperature on the temperature distribution and thermal spread of battery modules are also studied. The results indicate that the BTMS consisting of flat heat pipes (FHPs) and bottom and side liquid cooling plates can effectively suppress thermal spread and improve the safety of the battery module.},

ABSTRACT = {A reliable and accurate estimation of the state-of-health (SOH) of lithium batteries is critical to safely operating electric vehicles and other equipment. This paper proposes a state-of-health estimation method based on fennec fox optimization algorithm–mixed extreme learning machine (FFA-MELM). Firstly, health indicators are extracted from lithium-battery-charging data, and grey relational analysis (GRA) is employed to identify highly correlated features with the state-of-health of the battery. Subsequently, a state-of-health estimation model based on mixed extreme learning machine is constructed, and the hyperparameters of the model are optimized using the fennec fox optimization algorithm to improve estimation accuracy and convergence speed. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method has significantly improved the accuracy of the state-of-health estimation for lithium batteries compared to the extreme learning machine. Furthermore, it can achieve precise state-of-health estimation results for multiple batteries, even under complex operating conditions and with limited charge/discharge cycle data.},

ABSTRACT = {Batteries have been considered a key element in several applications, ranging from grid-scale storage systems through electric vehicles to daily-use small-scale electronic devices. However, excessive charging and discharging will impair their capabilities and could cause their applications to fail catastrophically. Among several diagnostic indices, state-of-charge estimation is essential for evaluating a battery’s capabilities. Various approaches have been introduced to reach this target, including white, gray, and black box or data-driven battery models. The main objective of this work is to provide an extensive comparison of currently highly utilized machine learning-based estimation techniques. The paper thoroughly investigates these models’ architectures, computational burdens, advantages, drawbacks, and robustness validation. The evaluation’s main criteria were based on measurements recorded under various operating conditions at the Energy Systems Research Laboratory (ESRL) at FIU for the eFlex 52.8 V/5.4 kWh lithium iron phosphate battery pack. The primary outcome of this research is that, while the random forest regression (RFR) model emerges as the most effective tool for SoC estimation in lithium-ion batteries, there is potential to enhance the performance of simpler models through strategic adjustments and optimizations. Additionally, the choice of model ultimately depends on the specific requirements of the task at hand, balancing the need for accuracy with the complexity and computational resources available and how it can be merged with other SoC estimation approaches to achieve high precision.},

ABSTRACT = {The increasing adoption of lithium-ion battery cells in contemporary energy storage applications has raised concerns regarding their potential hazards. Ensuring the safety of compact and modern energy storage systems over their operational lifespans necessitates precise and dependable monitoring techniques. This research introduces a novel method for the cell-specific surveillance of prismatic lithium-ion cells, with a focus on detecting pressure increases through the surface application of a fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensor on a rupture disc. Commercially available prismatic cells, commonly used in the automotive sector, are employed as test specimens and equipped with proven pressure and innovative FBG sensors. Encompassing the analysis capacity, internal resistance, and pressure (under elevated ambient temperatures of up to 120 °C), this investigation explores the thermal degradation effects. The applied FBG sensor on the rupture disc exhibits reversible and irreversible state changes in the cells, offering a highly sensitive and reliable monitoring solution for the early detection of abuse and post-abuse cell condition analysis. This innovative approach represents a practical implementation of fiber optic sensor technology that is designed for strain-based monitoring of prismatic lithium-ion cells, thereby enabling customized solutions through which to address safety challenges in prismatic cell applications. In alignment with the ongoing exploration of lithium-ion batteries, this research offers a customizable addition to battery monitoring and fault detection.},

ABSTRACT = {Layered oxides exhibit interesting performance as positive electrodes for commercial sodium-ion batteries. Nevertheless, the replacement of low-sustainable nickel with more abundant iron would be desirable. Although it can be achieved in P2-Na2/3Ni2/9Fe2/9Mn5/9O2, its performance still requires further improvement. Many imaginative strategies such as surface modification have been proposed to minimize undesirable interactions at the cathode–electrolyte interface while facilitating sodium insertion in different materials. Here, we examine four different approaches based on the use of the electron-conductive polymer poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene) (PEDOT) as an additive: (i) electrochemical in situ polymerization of the monomer, (ii) manual mixing with the active material, (iii) coating the current collector, and (iv) a combination of the latter two methods. As compared with pristine layered oxide, the electrochemical performance shows a particularly effective way of increasing cycling stability by using electropolymerization. Contrarily, the mixtures show less improvement, probably due to the heterogeneous distribution of oxide and polymer in the samples. In contrast with less conductive polyanionic cathode materials such as phosphates, the beneficial effects of PEDOT on oxide cathodes are not as much in rate performance as in inhibiting cycling degradation, due to the compactness of the electrodes without loss of electrical contact between active particles.},

ABSTRACT = {The impact of global warming has required the development of efficient new types of batteries. One of the most promising is Zn-O2 batteries because they provide the second biggest theoretical energy density, with relevant safety and a cycle of life long enough to be fitted for massive use. However, their industrial use is hindered by a series of obstacles, such as a fast reduction in the energy density after the initial charge and discharge cycles and a limited cathode efficiency or an elevated overpotential between discharge and charge. This work is focused on the synthesis of titanium compounds as catalyzers for the cathode of a Zn-O2 aqueous battery and their characterization. The results have shown a surface area of 350 m2/g after the elimination of the organic templates during heat treatment at 500 °C in air. Different thermal treatments were performed, tuning different parameters, such as intermediate treatment at 500 °C or the atmosphere used and the final temperature. Surface areas remain high for samples without an intermediate temperature step of 500 °C. Raman spectroscopy studies confirmed the nitridation of samples. SEM and XRD showed macro–meso-porosity and the presence of nitrogen, and the electrochemical evaluation confirmed the catalytic properties of this material in oxygen reaction reduction (ORR)/oxygen evolution reaction (OER) analysis and Zn-O2 battery tests.},

ABSTRACT = {Despite the variety of solid electrolytes available, no single solid electrolyte has been found that meets all the requirements of the successor technology of lithium-ion batteries in an optimum way. However, composite hybrid electrolytes that combine the desired properties such as high ionic conductivity or stability against lithium are promising. The addition of conductive oxide fillers to sulfide solid electrolytes has been reported to increase ionic conductivity and improve stability relative to the individual electrolytes, but the influence of the mixing process to create composite electrolytes has not been investigated. Here, we investigate Li3PS4 (LPS) and Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) composite electrolytes using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and distribution of relaxation times. The distinction between sulfide bulk and grain boundary polarization processes is possible with the methods used at temperatures below 10 °C. We propose lithium transport through the space-charge layer within the sulfide electrolyte, which increases the conductivity. With increasing mixing intensities in a high-energy ball mill, we show an overlay of the enhanced lithium-ion transport with the structural change of the sulfide matrix component, which increases the ionic conductivity of LPS from 4.1 × 10−5 S cm−1 to 1.7 × 10−4 S cm−1.},

ABSTRACT = {Despite features of cost-effectiveness, high safety, and superior capacity, aqueous zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs) have issues of uncontrolled dendritic cell failure and poor Zn utilization, resulting in inferior cycling reversibility. Herein, the environmentally friendly and naturally abundant sodium citrate (SC) was adopted as a dual-functional additive for ZnSO4-based (ZSO) electrolytes. Owing to the abundant hydrogen-bond donors and hydrogen-bond acceptors of SC, the Zn2+-solvation shell is interrupted to facilitate Zn desolvation, resulting in inhibited corrosion reactions. Additionally, sodium ions (Na+) from the SC additive with a lower effective reduction potential than that of zinc ions (Zn2+) form an electrostatic shield inhibiting the formation of initial surface protuberances and subsequent Zn dendrite growth. This assists in the Zn three-dimensional (3D) diffusion and deposition, thereby effectively enhancing cycling stability. Specifically, a long cycling lifespan (more than 760 h) of the Zn//Zn symmetric cell is achieved with a 2 M ZSO-1.0 SC electrolyte at a current density of 1 mA cm−2. When coupled with the NaV3O8·1.5 H2O (NVO) cathode, the full battery containing SC additive exhibited a capacity retention rate (40.0%) and a cycling life of 400 cycles at a current density of 1 A g−1 compared with that of pure ZnSO4 electrolyte (23.8%). This work provides a protocol for selecting an environmentally friendly and naturally abundant dual-functional electrolyte additive to achieve solvation shell regulation and Zn anode protection for the practical large-scale application of ZIBs.},

ABSTRACT = {Predicting the operating temperature of lithium-ion battery during different cycles is important when it comes to the safety and efficiency of electric vehicles. In this regard, it is vital to adopt a suitable modeling approach to analyze the thermal performance of a battery. In this paper, the temperature of lithium-ion NMC pouch battery has been investigated. A new formulation of lumped model based on the thermal resistance network is proposed. Unlike previous models that treated the battery as a single entity, the proposed model introduces a more detailed analysis by incorporating thermal interactions between individual cells and tabs within a single cell scenario, while also considering interactions between cells and insulators or gaps, located between the cells, within the module case. This enhancement allows for the precise prediction of temperature variations across different cells implemented within the battery module. In order to evaluate the accuracy of the prediction, a three-dimensional finite element model was adopted as a reference. The study was performed first on a single cell, then on modules composed of several cells connected in series, during different operating conditions. A comprehensive comparison between both models was conducted. The analysis focused on two main aspects, the accuracy of temperature predictions and the computational time required. Notably, the developed lumped model showed a significant capability to estimate cell temperatures within the modules. The thermal results revealed close agreement with the values predicted by the finite element model, while needing significantly lower computational time. For instance, while the finite element model took almost 21 h to predict the battery temperature during consecutive charge/discharge cycles of a 10-cell module, the developed lumped model predicted the temperature within seconds, with a maximum difference of 0.42 °C.},

ABSTRACT = {In this study, we investigate the use of artificial neural networks as a potentially efficient method to determine the rate capability of electrodes for lithium-ion batteries with different porosities. The performance of a lithium-ion battery is, to a large extent, determined by the microstructure (i.e., layer thickness and porosity) of its electrodes. Tailoring the microstructure to a specific application is a crucial process in battery development. However, unravelling the complex correlations between microstructure and rate performance using either experiments or simulations is time-consuming and costly. Our approach provides a swift method for predicting the rate capability of battery electrodes by using machine learning on microstructural images of electrode cross-sections. We train multiple models in order to predict the specific capacity based on the batteries’ microstructure and investigate the decisive parts of the microstructure through the use of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods. Our study shows that even comparably small neural network architectures are capable of providing state-of-the-art prediction results. In addition to this, our XAI studies demonstrate that the models are using understandable human features while ignoring present artefacts.},

ABSTRACT = {The aqueous processing of cathode materials for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) has both environmental and cost benefits. However, high-loading, water-based electrodes from the layered oxides (e.g., NMC) typically exhibit worse electrochemical performance than NMP-based electrodes. In this work, primary, binary, and ternary binder mixtures of aqueous binders such as CMC, PAA, PEO, SBR, and Na alginate, in combination with bare and C-coated Al current collectors, were explored, aiming to improve the rate capability performance of NMC811 electrodes with high areal capacity (≥4 mAh cm−2) and low binder content (3 wt.%). Electrodes with a ternary binder composition (CMC:PAA:SBR) have the best performance with bare Al current collectors, attaining a specific capacity of 150 mAh g−1 at 1C. Using carbon-coated Al current collectors results in improved performance for both water- and NMP-based electrodes. This is further accentuated for Na-Alg and CMC:PAA binder compositions. These electrodes show specific capacities of 170 and 80 mAh g−1 at 1C and 2C, respectively. Although the specific capacities at 1C are comparable to those for NMP-PVDF electrodes, they are approximately 50% higher at the 2C rate. This study aims to contribute to the development of sustainably processed NMC electrodes for high energy density LIBs using water as solvent.},

ABSTRACT = {The zinc anode mainly faces technical problems such as short circuits caused by the growth of dendrite, low coulomb efficiency, and a short cycle life caused by side reactions, which impedes the rapid development of aqueous zinc-ion batteries (AZIBs). Herein, a common ionic liquid, 1,1-Spirobipyrrolidinium tetrafluoroborate ([SBP]BF4), is selected as a new additive for pure ZnSO4 electrolyte. It is found that this additive could regulate the solvation sheath of hydrated Zn2+ ions, promote the ionic mobility of Zn2+, homogenize the flux of Zn2+, avoid side reactions between the electrolyte and electrode, and inhibit the production of zinc dendrites by facilitating the establishment of an inorganic solid electrolyte interphase layer. With the 1% [SBP]BF4-modified electrolyte, the Zn||Zn symmetric cell delivers an extended plating/stripping cycling life of 2000 h at 1 mA cm−2, which is much higher than that of the cell without additives (330 h). As a proof of concept, the Zn‖V2O5 battery using the [SBP]BF4 additive shows excellent cycling stability, maintaining its specific capacity at 97 mAh g−1 after 2000 cycles at 5 A g−1, which is much greater than the 46 mAh g−1 capacity of the non-additive battery. This study offers zinc anode stabilization through high-efficiency electrolyte engineering.},

ABSTRACT = {As the Electric Vehicle market grows, understanding the implications of battery degradation on the driving experience is key to fostering trust among users and improving End of Life estimations. This study analyses various road types, charging behaviours and Electric Vehicle models to evaluate the impact of degradation on the performance. Key indicators related to the speed, acceleration, driving times and regenerative capabilities are obtained for different degradation levels to quantify the performance decay. Results show that the impact is highly dependent on the road type and nominal battery capacity. Vehicles with long and medium ranges show a robust performance for common driving conditions. Short-range vehicles perform adequately in urban and rural road conditions, but on highways, speed and acceleration reductions of up to 6.7 km/h and 3.96 (km/h)/s have been observed. The results of this study suggest that degradation should not be a concern for standard driving conditions and mid- and long-range vehicles currently dominate the market. In addition, the results are used to define a functional End of Life criterion based on performance loss, beyond the oversimplified 70–80% State-of-Health threshold, which does not consider individual requirements.},

ABSTRACT = {The ubiquitous deployment of Li-ion batteries (LIBs) in more demanding applications has reinforced the need to understand the root causes of thermal runaway. Herein, we perform a forensic simulation of a real-case failure scenario, using localised heating of Li(Ni0.5Mn0.3Co0.2)O2 versus graphite 18650 cylindrical cells. This study determined the localised temperatures that would lead to venting and thermal runaway of these cells, as well as correlating the gases produced as a function of the degradation pathway. Catastrophic failure, involving melting (with internal cell temperatures exceeding 1085 °C), deformation and ejection of the cell componentry, was induced by locally applying 200 °C and 250 °C to a fully charged cell. Conversely, catastrophic failure was not observed when the same temperatures were applied to the cells at a lower state of charge (SOC). This work highlights the importance of SOC, chemistry and heat in driving the thermal failure mode of Ni-rich LIB cells, allowing for a better understanding of battery safety and the associated design improvements.},

ABSTRACT = {The automotive industry aims for the highest possible driving range (highest energy density) in combination with a fast charge ability (highest power density) of electric vehicles. With both targets being intrinsically contradictory, it is important to understand and optimize resistances within lithium-ion battery (LIB) electrodes. In this study, the properties and magnitude of electronic resistance contributions in LiMn0.7Fe0.3PO4 (LMFP)- and LiNixCoyMnzO2 (NCM, x = 0.88~0.90, x + y + z = 1)-based electrodes are comprehensively investigated through the use of different measurement methods. Contact resistance properties are characterized via electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) on the example of LMFP cathodes. The EIS results are compared to a two-point probe as well as to the results obtained using a novel commercial 46-point probe system. The magnitude and ratio of contact resistance and compound electronic resistance for LMFP- and NCM-based cathodes are discussed on the basis of the 46-point probe measurement results. The results show that the 46-point probe yields significantly lower resistance values than those in EIS studies. Further results show that electronic resistance values in cathodes can vary over several orders of magnitude. Various influence parameters such as electrode porosity, type of current collector and the impact of solvent soaking on electronic resistance are investigated.},

ABSTRACT = {With the proliferation of electric vehicles (EVs) and the consequential increase in EV battery circulation, the need for accurate assessments of battery health and remaining useful life (RUL) is paramount, driven by environmentally friendly and sustainable goals. This study addresses this pressing concern by employing data-driven methods, specifically harnessing deep learning techniques to enhance RUL estimation for lithium-ion batteries (LIB). Leveraging the Toyota Research Institute Dataset, consisting of 124 lithium-ion batteries cycled to failure and encompassing key metrics such as capacity, temperature, resistance, and discharge time, our analysis substantially improves RUL prediction accuracy. Notably, the convolutional long short-term memory deep neural network (CLDNN) model and the transformer LSTM (temporal transformer) model have emerged as standout remaining useful life (RUL) predictors. The CLDNN model, in particular, achieved a remarkable mean absolute error (MAE) of 84.012 and a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 25.676. Similarly, the temporal transformer model exhibited a notable performance, with an MAE of 85.134 and a MAPE of 28.7932. These impressive results were achieved by applying Bayesian hyperparameter optimization, further enhancing the accuracy of predictive methods. These models were bench-marked against existing approaches, demonstrating superior results with an improvement in MAPE ranging from 4.01% to 7.12%.},

ABSTRACT = {In vanadium redox flow batteries, the flow field geometry plays a dramatic role on the distribution of the electrolyte and its design results from the trade-off between high battery performance and low pressure drops. In the literature, it was demonstrated that electrolyte permeation through the porous electrode is mainly regulated by pressure difference between adjacent channels, leading to the presence of under-the-rib fluxes. With the support of a 3D computational fluid dynamic model, this work presents two novel flow field geometries that are designed to tune the direction of the pressure gradients between channels in order to promote the under-the-rib fluxes mechanism. The first geometry is named Two Outlets and exploits the splitting of the electrolyte flow into two adjacent interdigitated layouts with the aim to give to the pressure gradient a more transverse direction with respect to the channels, raising the intensity of under-the-rib fluxes and making their distribution more uniform throughout the electrode area. The second geometry is named Four Inlets and presents four inlets located at the corners of the distributor, with an interdigitated-like layout radially oriented from each inlet to one single central outlet, with the concept of reducing the heterogeneity of the flow velocity within the electrode. Subsequently, flow fields performance is verified experimentally adopting a segmented hardware in symmetric cell configuration with positive electrolyte, which permits the measurement of local current distribution and local electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Compared to a conventional interdigitated geometry, both the developed configurations permit a significant decrease in the pressure drops without any reduction in battery performance. In the Four Inlets flow field the pressure drop reduction is more evident (up to 50%) due to the lower electrolyte velocities in the feeding channels, while the Two Outlets configuration guarantees a more homogeneous current density distribution.},

ABSTRACT = {The improvement of fast-charging capabilities for lithium-ion batteries significantly influences the widespread application of electric vehicles. Fast-charging performance depends not only on materials but also on the battery’s inherent structure and the heterogeneity of the electrode reaction. Herein, we utilized advanced imaging techniques to explore how the internal structure of cylindrical batteries impacts macroscopic electrochemical performance. Our research unveiled the natural 3D structural non-uniformity of the electrodes, causing heterogeneity of electrode reaction. This non-uniformity of reaction exhibited a macro–meso–micro-scale feature in four dimensions: the exterior versus the interior of the electrode, the middle versus the sides of the cell, the inside versus the outside of the cell, and the surface versus the body of the electrode. Furthermore, the single-coated side of the anode demonstrated notably faster reaction than the double-coated sides, leading to the deposition of island-like lithium during fast charging. These discoveries offer novel insights into multi-scale fast-charging mechanisms for commercial batteries, inspiring innovative approaches to battery design.},

ABSTRACT = {Rapid technological changes and disruptive innovations have resulted in a significant shift in people’s behavior and requirements. Electronic gadgets, including smartphones, notebooks, and other devices, are indispensable to everyday routines. Consequently, the demand for high-capacity batteries has surged, which has enabled extended device autonomy. An alternative approach to address this demand is battery swapping, which can potentially extend the battery life of electronic devices. Although battery sharing in electric vehicles has been well studied, smartphone applications still need to be explored. Crucially, assessing the batteries’ state of health (SoH) presents a challenge, necessitating consensus on the best estimation methods to develop effective battery swap strategies. This paper proposes a model for estimating the SoH curve of lithium-ion batteries using the state of charge curve. The model was designed for smartphone battery swap applications utilizing Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) neural networks. To validate the model, a system was developed to conduct destructive tests on batteries and study their behavior over their lifetimes. The results demonstrated the high precision of the model in estimating the SoH of batteries under various charge and discharge parameters. The proposed approach exhibits low computational complexity, low cost, and easily measurable input parameters, making it an attractive solution for smartphone battery swap applications.},

ABSTRACT = {Effectively extracting a lithium-ion battery’s impedance is of great importance for various onboard applications, which requires consideration of both the time consumption and accuracy of the measurement process. Although the pseudorandom binary sequence (PRBS) excitation signal can inject the superposition frequencies with high time efficiency and an easily implementable device, processing the data of the battery’s impedance measurement is still a challenge at present. This study proposes a fast impedance spectrum construction method for lithium-ion batteries, where a multi-density clustering algorithm was designed to effectively extract the useful impedance after PRBS injection. According to the distribution properties of the measurement points by PRBS, a density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) was used for processing the data of the lithium-ion battery’s impedance. The two key parameters of the DBSCAN were adjusted by a delicate workflow according to the frequency range. The validation of the proposed method was proved on a 3 Ah lithium-ion battery under nine different test conditions, considering both the SOC and temperature variations.},

ABSTRACT = {As electric vehicles (EVs) gain market dominance, ensuring safety during the battery usage is crucial. This paper presents a new thermal management approach to address the battery heat accumulation challenge through a novel combination of composite phase change material (CPCM) with liquid cooling systems. An optimised hybrid cooling model is developed to evaluate the proposed battery thermal management system (BTMS) under high-temperature and high-power conditions. Benchmark studies are conducted to assess the impact of inlet position, inlet flow rate, and flow channel distribution on the cooling performance to achieve a uniform temperature distribution within the battery. The optimised BTMS, consisting of a five-cell battery pack, demonstrates a maximum temperature of 41.15 °C and a temperature difference of 4.89 °C in a operating condition at 36 °C with a discharge rate of 3 C. The BTMS outperforms the initial model, reducing the maximum temperature by 1.5%, temperature difference by 5%, and liquid fraction by 13%, with a slight (1.3%) increase in weight. The cooling performance is most efficient at a liquid flow rate of 0.1 m/s, minimising energy consumption. The proposed BTMS with CPCM-3 is also sufficient enough to keep the battery pack under a thermal runaway event. Overall, the theoretical simulation highlights the BTMS’s ability to effectively control battery temperatures and temperature differences, ensuring safe operation during high-temperature and high-power conditions in practical EV usage.},

ABSTRACT = {As a successor to LiFePO4, the research interest in LiMn1−yFeyPO4 has been sustained due to its higher working voltage and safety features. However, its further application is limited by the low compaction density caused by uncontrolled particle size. In this study, the high-quality LiMn0.69Co0.01Fe0.3PO4 (LMFP) materials were prepared using the freeze-drying method to process the LMFP precursor synthesized through a solvothermal crystallization method followed by a calcination process at different temperatures (400–550 °C). The results demonstrate that the obtained particles exhibit a spheroidal shape with a low specific surface area after secondary crystallization calcination at 700 °C. The compaction density increased from 1.96 g/cm3 for LMFP precursor (LMFP-M1) to 2.18, 2.27, 2.34, and 2.43 g/cm3 for samples calcined at 400, 450, 500 and 550 °C, respectively, achieving a maximum increase of 24%. The full cell constructed with the high-compaction-density material calcined at 500 °C displayed discharge capacities of 144.1, 143.8, and 142.6 mAh/g at 0.5, 1, and 3 C rates, respectively, with a retention rate of 99% at 3 C rate. After undergoing charging and discharging cycles at a rate of 1 C for up to 800 cycles, the capacity retention rate was found to be 90%, indicating an expected full cell life span exceeding 2500 cycles.},

ABSTRACT = {While thermal runaway characterization and prediction is an important aspect of lithium-ion battery engineering and development, it is a requirement to ensure that a battery system can be safe under normal operations and during failure events. This study investigated the current existing literature regarding lithium-ion battery thermal runaway characterization and predictive modeling methods. A thermal model for thermal runaway prediction was adapted from the literature and is presented in this paper along with a comparison of empirical data and predicted data using the model. Empirical data were collected from a Samsung 30Q 18650 cylindrical cell and from a large 20 Ah pouch cell format using accelerated rate calorimetry. The predictive model was executed in a macro-enabled Microsoft Excel workbook for simplicity and accessibility for the public. The primary purpose of using more primitive modeling software was to provide an accurate model that was generally accessible without the purchase of or training in a specific modeling software package. The modes of heat transfer during the thermal runaway event were studied and are reported in this work, along with insights on thermal management during a thermal runaway failure event.},

ABSTRACT = {Graphite anode materials and carbonate electrolyte have been the top choices for commercial lithium-ion batteries (LIBS) for a long time. However, the uneven deposition and stripping of lithium cause irreversible damage to the graphite structure, and the low flash point and high flammability of the carbonate electrolyte pose a significant fire safety risk. Here, we proposed a multifunctional electrolyte additive diphenylphosphoryl azide (DPPA), which can construct a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) with high ionic conductivity lithium nitride (Li3N) to ensure efficient transport of Li+. This not only protects the artificial graphite (AG) electrode but also inhibits lithium dendrites to achieve excellent electrochemical performance. Meanwhile, the LIBS with DPPA offers satisfactory flame retardancy performance. The AG//Li half cells with DPPA-0.5M can still maintain a specific capacity of about 350 mAh/g after 200 cycles at 0.2 C. Its cycle performance and rate performance were better than commercial electrolyte (EC/DMC). After cycling, the microstructure surface of the AG electrode was complete and flat, and the surface of the lithium metal electrode had fewer lithium dendrites. Importantly, we found that the pouch cell with DPPA-0.5M had low peak heat release rate. When exposed to external conditions of continuous heating, DPPA significantly improved the fire safety of the LIBS. The research of DPPA in lithium electrolyte is a step towards the development of safe and efficient lithium batteries.},

ABSTRACT = {As the use of Li-ion batteries is spreading, incidents in large energy storage systems (stationary storage containers, etc.) or in large-scale cell and battery storages (warehouses, recyclers, etc.), often leading to fire, are occurring on a regular basis. Water remains one of the most efficient fire extinguishing agents for tackling such battery incidents, and large quantities are usually necessary. Since batteries contain various potentially harmful components (metals and their oxides or salts, solvents, etc.) and thermal-runaway-induced battery incidents are accompanied by complex and potentially multistage fume emissions (containing both gas and particles), the potential impact of fire run-off waters on the environment should be considered and assessed carefully. The tests presented in this paper focus on analyzing the composition of run-off waters used to spray NMC Li-ion modules under thermal runaway. It highlights that waters used for firefighting are susceptible to containing many metals, including Ni, Mn, Co, Li and Al, mixed with other carbonaceous species (soot, tarballs) and sometimes undecomposed solvents used in the electrolyte. Extrapolation of pollutant concentrations compared with PNEC values showed that, for large-scale incidents, run-off water could be potentially hazardous to the environment.},

ABSTRACT = {Second-life applications for lithium-ion batteries offer industry opportunities to defer recycling costs, enhance economic value, and reduce environmental impacts. However, cells are affected by numerous aging phenomena which can lead to an acceleration in capacity loss. This paper uses postmortem techniques to compare aging phenomenon in 1.1 Ah 18650 graphite/LFP cells, examining the differences between a pristine cell and three cells aged to 40~30% of state of health (SoH). Macroscopic and microscopic techniques are used to identify aging phenomenon occurring in the cell on both positive and negative electrodes. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS) and scanning electron microscopes (SEMs) with back-scattered electron (BSE) detector are used to analyze each electrode. These methods are used to analyze the morphology and the material on each electrode. The results show a stable positive LFP electrode whereas numerous deposits and cracking occurred on the negative electrode. A discussion of the appearance of those aging phenomenon is presented. Impacts for industrial cells in second-life applications are finally discussed.},

ABSTRACT = {The demand for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) is driven by environmental concerns and market growth, particularly in the transportation sector. The EU’s push for net-zero emissions and the European Green Deal accentuates the role of battery technologies in sustainable energy supply. Organic acids, like gluconic acid, are explored for the eco-friendly leaching of valuable metals from spent batteries. This study investigates leaching kinetics using gluconic acid (hydrolyzed glucono-1.5-lacton), analyzing factors such as temperature, acid concentration, particle size, and reaction time. Results reveal the temperature’s influence on leaching efficiency for cobalt, nickel, and lithium. The mechanism for Co follows a surface chemical reaction model with an activation energy of 28.2 kJ·mol−1. Nickel, on the contrary, shows a diffusion-controlled regime and an activation energy of 70.1 kJ·mol−1. The reaction of leaching Ni and Co using gluconic acid was determined to be first-order. The process within this environmentally friendly alternative leaching agent shows great potential for sustainable metal recovery.},

ABSTRACT = {Developing cost-effective cathode materials is conducive to accelerating the commercialization of sodium-ion batteries. Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7 (NFPP) has attracted extensive attention owning to its high theoretical capacity, stable structure, and low cost of raw materials. However, its inherent low conductivity hinders its further application. Herein, carbon-coated NFPP nanospheres are anchored to crumpled MXene nanosheets by an electrostatic self-assembly; this cross-linked structure induced by CTAB not only significantly expands the contact area between particles and improves the electronic conductivity, but also effectively reduces the aggregation of NFPP nanoparticles. The as-designed Na4Fe3(PO4)2(P2O7)@C/Ti3C2Tx (NFPP@MX) cathode exhibits a high discharge capacity (106.1 mAh g−1 g at 0.2 C), good rate capability (60.4 mAh g−1 at 10 C), and a long-life cyclic stability (85.2% capacity retention after 1000 cycles at 1 C). This study provides an effective strategy for the massive production of high-performance NFPP cathodes and broadens the application of MXene in the modification of other cathode materials.},

The dissolution of Mn and Ni, as well as the penetration of Zn inside the framework were detected, while the Mn aggregations were found outside the hexacyanoferrate framework. Additionally, the possibility of conducting X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements on the regions of interest made it possible to explore the chemical state of each metal, and furthermore, synchrotron-based powder X-ray diffraction demonstrated the gradual structural modification in 30% Ni-containing sample series in terms of the different phase formation.},

ABSTRACT = {The aim of this study is to investigate new materials that can be employed as cathode hosts in Li-S batteries, which would be able to overcome the effect of the shuttling of soluble polysulfides and maximize the battery capacity and energy density. Density functional theory (DFT) simulations are used to determine the adsorption energy of lithium sulfides in two types of cathode hosts: lithiated 1T-MoS2 (1T-LixMoS2) and hybrid 1T-LixMoS2/graphene. Initial simulations of lithiated 1T-MoS2 structures led to the selection of an optimized 1T-Li0.75MoS2 structure, which was utilized for the formation of an optimized 1T-Li0.75MoS2 bilayer and a hybrid 1T-Li0.75MoS2/graphene bilayer structure. It was found that all sulfides exhibited super-high adsorption energies in the interlayer inside the 1T-Li0.75MoS2 bilayer and very good adsorption energy values in the interlayer inside the hybrid 1T-Li0.75MoS2/graphene bilayer. The placement of sulfides outside each type of bilayer, over the 1T-Li0.75MoS2 surface, yielded good adsorption energies in the range of −2 to −3.8 eV, which are higher than those over a 1T-MoS2 substrate.},

ABSTRACT = {Block copolymers (BCPs) as solid electrolytes for batteries are usually designed to have an ion-solvating block for ion conduction and an ionophobic block for providing mechanical strength. Here, we show a novel solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) for sodium batteries based on a poly(vinyl benzoate)-b-poly(diallyldimethyl ammonium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide) PVBx-b-PDADMATFSIy-b-PVBx ABA triblock copolymer. The SPE triblock copolymer comprises a polymerized ionic liquid (PIL) ion-solvating block combined with NaFSI salt as an internal block and an ionophilic PVB as an external block. Four distinct compositions with varying chain lengths of the blocks were synthesized by reversible addition−fragmentation chain-transfer (RAFT) polymerization. The neat copolymers were subsequently mixed with NaFSI in a 2:1 mol ratio of Na to ionic monomer units. Through comprehensive analysis using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), it was revealed that the ion coordination within the polymer–salt mixtures undergoes changes based on the composition of the starting neat polymer. Electrochemical evaluations identified the optimal composition for practical application as PVB11.5K-b-PDADMATFSI33K-b-PVB11.5K, showing an ionic conductivity at 70 °C of 4.2 × 10−5 S cm−1. This polymer electrolyte formulation was investigated for sodium in Na|Na symmetrical cells, showing an overpotential of 200 mV at 70 °C at 0.1 mA cm−2. When applied in a sodium–air battery, the polymer electrolyte membrane achieved a discharge capacity of 1.59 mAh cm−2 at 50 °C.},
