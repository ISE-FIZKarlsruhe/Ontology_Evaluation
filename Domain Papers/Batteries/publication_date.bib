ABSTRACT = {An increase in the energy density on the cell level while maintaining a high power density can be realized by combining thick-film electrodes and the 3D battery concept. The effect of laser structuring using different pattern types on the electrochemical performance was studied. For this purpose, LiNi0.6Mn0.2Co0.2O2 (NMC 622) thick-film cathodes were prepared with a PVDF binder and were afterward structured using ultrafast laser ablation. Eight different pattern types were realized, which are lines, grids, holes, hexagonal structures, and their respective combinations. In addition, the mass loss caused by laser ablation was kept the same regardless of the pattern type. The laser-structured electrodes were assembled in coin cells and subsequently electrochemically characterized. It was found that when discharging the cells for durations of less than 2 h, a significant, positive impact of laser patterning on the electrochemical cell performance was observed. For example, when discharging was performed for one hour, cells containing laser-patterned electrodes with different structure types exhibited a specific capacity increase of up to 70 mAh/g in contrast to the reference ones. Although cells with a hole-patterned electrode exhibited a minimum capacity increase in the rate capability analysis, the combination of holes with lines, grids, or hexagons led to further capacity increases. In addition, long-term cycle analyses demonstrated the benefits of laser patterning on the cell lifetime, while cyclic voltammetry highlighted an increase in the Li-ion diffusion kinetics in cells containing hexagonal-patterned electrodes.},

ABSTRACT = {With an increase in global warming, battery electric vehicles (BEVs), which are environmentally friendly, have been rapidly commercialized to replace conventional vehicles with internal combustion engines. Unlike traditional internal combustion engine vehicles, the powertrain system of BEVs operates with high efficiency, resulting in lower heat generation. This poses a challenge for cabin heating under low-temperature conditions. Conversely, under high-temperature conditions, the operating temperature of a high-voltage battery (HVB) is lower than the ambient air temperature, which makes cooling through ambient air challenging. To overcome these challenges, in this study, we proposed an integrated thermal management system (ITMS) based on a heat pump system capable of stable thermal management under diverse climatic conditions. Furthermore, to assess the ability of the proposed ITMS to perform thermal management under various climatic conditions, we integrated a detailed powertrain system model incorporating BEV specifications and the proposed ITMS model based on the heat pump system. The ITMS model was evaluated under high-load-driving conditions, specifically the HWFET scenario, demonstrating its capability to perform stable thermal management not only under high-temperature conditions, such as at 36 °C, but also under low-temperature conditions, such as at −10 °C, through the designated thermal management modes.},

ABSTRACT = {Reducing greenhouse emissions can be done via the electrification of the transport industry. However, there are challenges related to the electrification such as the lifetime of vehicle batteries as well as limitations on the charging possibilities. To cope with some of these challenges, a charge scheduling method for fleets of electric vehicles is presented. Such a method assigns the charging moments (i.e., schedules) of fleets that have more vehicles than chargers. While doing the assignation, the method also maximizes the total Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of all the vehicle batteries. The method consists of two optimization algorithms. The first optimization algorithm determines charging profiles (i.e., charging current vs time) for individual vehicles. The second algorithm finds the charging schedule (i.e., the order in which vehicles are connected to a charger) that maximizes the RUL in the batteries of the entire fleet. To reduce the computational effort of predicting the battery RUL, the method uses a Machine Learning (ML) model. Such a model predicts the RUL of an individual battery while taking into account common stress factors and fabrication-related differences per battery. Simulation results show that charging a single vehicle as late as possible maximizes the RUL of that single vehicle, due to the lower battery degradation. Simulations also show that the ML model accurately predicts the RUL, while taking into account fabrication-related variability in the battery. Additionally, it was shown that this method schedules the charging moments of a fleet, leading to an increased total RUL of all the batteries in the vehicle fleet.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, a high-efficiency and low-cost active cell-to-cell balancing circuit for the reuse of electric vehicle (EV) batteries is proposed. In the proposed method, a battery string is divided into two legs to transfer the charge from each cell in one leg to that in the other and a bidirectional CLLC resonant converter is used to transfer energy between the selected cells. Thanks to the proposed structure, the number of bidirectional switches and gate drivers can be reduced by half compared to the conventional direct cell-to-cell topologies, thereby achieving lower cost for the system. The CLLC converter is used to transfer the charge, and it is designed to work at resonant frequencies to achieve zero-voltage zero-current switching (ZVZCS) for all the switches and diodes. Consequently, the system’s efficiency can be enhanced, and hence, the fuel economy of the system can also be improved significantly. To verify the performance of the proposed active cell-balancing system, a prototype is implemented for balancing the three EV battery modules that contain twelve lithium-ion batteries from xEV. The maximum efficiency achieved for the charge transfer is 89.4%, and the balancing efficiency is 96.3%.},

ABSTRACT = {As the world’s automotive battery cell production capacity expands, so too does the demand for sustainable production. Much of the industry’s efforts are aimed at reducing the high energy consumption in battery cell production. A key driver is electrode drying, which is currently performed in long ovens using large volumes of hot air. Several drying technologies from other industries could reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions if successfully applied to battery cell production. High process and quality requirements must be met when adapting these technologies for battery cell production. Evaluating the technologies against these requirements is difficult due to the technological novelty of this industry and the associated lack of data. Furthermore, the significant differences in drying technologies render a comparison even more challenging. One objective of this study was to evaluate drying technologies and identify those that could be best adapted to lithium-ion battery cell production. Near-infrared and laser drying were found to be the best in terms of energy efficiency, cost savings and other parameters. Another aim was to analyse, in more detail, the technological challenges and the advantages and disadvantages of the top-ranked drying technologies. Finally, the saving potential for greenhouse gas emissions of near-infrared and laser drying was calculated for a global production scenario of LIB cells in 2030. The saving potential in this scenario would amount to 2.63 million metric tonnes (Mt) CO2eq per year if near-infrared drying was applied in all global LIB cell production facilities within the mentioned scenario and 1.47 million Mt CO2eq per year for laser drying.},

ABSTRACT = {Developing efficient recycling processes with high recycling quotas for the recovery of graphite and other critical raw materials contained in LIBs is essential and prudent. This action holds the potential to substantially diminish the supply risk of raw materials for LIBs and enhance the sustainability of their production. An essential processing step in LIB recycling involves the thermal treatment of black mass to degrade the binder. This step is crucial as it enhances the recycling efficiency in subsequent processes, such as flotation and leaching-based processing. Therefore, this paper introduces a Representative Black Mass Model (RBMM) and develops a computational framework for the simulation of the thermal degradation of polymer-based binders in black mass (BM). The models utilize the discrete element method (DEM) with a coarse-graining (CG) scheme and the isoconversional method to predict binder degradation and the required heat. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the binder polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) is utilized to determine the model parameters. The model simulates a specific thermal treatment case on a laboratory scale and investigates the relationship between the scale factor and heating rate. The findings reveal that, for a particular BM system, a scaling factor of 100 regarding the particle diameter is applicable within a heating rate range of 2 to 22 K/min.},

ABSTRACT = {Aiming to solve the problems of insufficient dynamic responses, the large loss of energy storage life of a single power cell, and the large fluctuation in DC (direct current) bus voltage in fuel cell vessels, this study takes a certain type of fuel cell ferry as the research object and proposes an improved equivalent minimum hydrogen consumption energy management strategy, based on fuzzy logic control. First, a hybrid power system including a fuel cell, a lithium–iron–phosphate battery, and a supercapacitor is proposed, with the simulation of the power system of the modified mother ship. Second, a power system simulation model and a double-closed-loop PI (proportion integration) control model are established in MATLAB/Simulink to design the equivalent hydrogen consumption model and fuzzy logic control strategy. The simulation results show that, under the premise of meeting the load requirements, the control strategy designed in this paper improves the Li-ion battery’s power, the Li-ion battery’s SOC (state of charge), the bus voltage stability, and the equivalent hydrogen consumption significantly, compared with those before optimization, which improves the stability and economy of the power system and has certain practical engineering value.},

Experimental characterization is carried out on cylindrical cells of 21700-type, where four regimes of cell degradation are identified, which are supplemented by an increased cell resistance and surface temperature during cell operation. The amount of intercalated lithium in the fully charged anodes in the fresh and aged states is determined by ex situ X-ray diffraction radiography and in situ X-ray diffraction computed tomography. The qualitatively similar character of the results revealed a loss of active lithium along with the development of a complex heterogeneous distribution over the electrode stripe.},

ABSTRACT = {The Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) is one of the possible solutions to overcoming the non-programmability associated with these energy sources. The capabilities of BESSs to store a consistent amount of energy and to behave as a load by releasing it ensures an essential source of flexibility to the power system. Nevertheless, BESSs have some drawbacks that pose limitations to their utilization. Indeed, effectively managing the stored and released energy is crucial, considering the degradation of performance associated with these systems over time. The substantial capital expenditure (CAPEX) required to install these systems represents a current constraint, impeding their broader adoption. This work evaluates a techno-economic analysis of a 2MW/2MWh BESS providing multiple services, namely participating in capacity and balance markets. The analysis is based on a BESS model implemented in SIMULINK, adopting online data gathered from a Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP) battery facility. The model evaluates the auxiliary power consumption, state-of-charge (SoC), state of health (SoH), and the round-trip efficiency (RTE) of the overall system. The analysis is based on three price profiles: 2019 (Business-As-Usual), 2020 (COVID-19), and 2022 (Gas Crisis). Furthermore, this work conducts a case study to analyze the behavior of the BESS. It entails a sensitivity analysis, specifically evaluating the influence of CAPEX and upward bid price on the economic viability of the project. The results show a strong relation between the CAPEX variation and the Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of the project.},

ABSTRACT = {Aqueous zinc ion batteries are highly sought after for the next generation of sustainable energy storage systems. However, their development is significantly impeded by the presence of undesired zinc dendrites, which greatly reduce their cycle life. It is well-received that surface passivation by introducing foreign metals represents a compelling measure to enhance the stability of Zn anodes. Nevertheless, the vast potential of effecting concerted interplay between multiple metal elements for enhanced overall performance in Zn ion batteries remains elusive, due to the overwhelming challenge in creating uniform textures from hetero-units and understanding the mechanism underlying the synergistic performance gain. In this work, an innovative bimetallic overlaying strategy is proposed that renders possible the synergy between AgZn3 and CuZn5 in effecting uniform Zn deposition in a laterally confined and compact manner. The seeded growth of Zn on the bimetal-modulated interface effectively reduces the nucleation potential barrier, yielding a low nucleation overpotential (25 mV). In full cell testing with a commercial MnO2 applied as the cathode, superb cycling stability, surpassing the results reported in previous works, is achieved. The cell delivers an outstanding remaining capacity of 215 mA h g−1 after 300 cycles with almost no capacity degradation observed. The simple and highly efficient bimetal design, which synergizes the strengths of distinct metals, has the potential to drive innovations in the development of multicomponent aqueous Zn batteries with exceptional performance.},

ABSTRACT = {Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have been widely used for electric vehicles owing to their high energy density, light weight, and no memory effect. However, their health management problems remain unsolved in actual application. Therefore, this paper focuses on battery capacity as the key health indicator and proposes a data-driven method for capacity prediction. Specifically, this method mainly utilizes Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for automatic feature extraction from raw data and combines it with the Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) algorithm to realize the capacity prediction of LIBs. In addition, the sparrow search algorithm (SSA) is used to optimize the hyper-parameters of the neural network to further improve the prediction performance of original network structures. Ultimately, experiments with a public dataset of batteries are carried out to verify and evaluate the effectiveness of capacity prediction under two temperature conditions. The results show that the SSA-CNN-BiLSTM framework for capacity prediction of LIBs has higher accuracy compared with other original network structures during the multi-battery cycle experiments.},

ABSTRACT = {In this study, the performances of a pouch Li-ion battery (LIB) with respect to temperature, pressure and discharge-rate variation are measured. A sensitivity study has been conducted with three temperatures (5 °C, 25 °C, 45 °C), four pressures (0.2 MPa, 0.5 MPa, 0.8 MPa, 1.2 MPa) and three electrical discharge rates (0.5 C, 1.5 C, 3.0 C). Electrochemical processes and overall efficiency are significantly affected by temperature and pressure, influencing capacity and charge–discharge rates. In previous studies, temperature and pressure were not controlled simultaneously due to technological limitations. A novel test bench was developed to investigate these influences by controlling the surface temperature and mechanical pressure on a pouch LIB during electrical charging and discharging. This test rig permits an accurate assessment of mechanical, thermal and electrical parameters, while decoupling thermal and mechanical influences during electrical operation. The results of the study confirm what has been found in the literature: an increase in pressure leads to a decrease in performance, while an increase in temperature leads to an increase in performance. However, the extent to which the pressure impacts performance is determined by the temperature and the applied electrical discharge rate. At 5 °C and 0.5 C, an increase in pressure from 0.2 MPa to 1.2 MPa results in a 5.84% decrease in discharged capacity. At 45 °C the discharge capacity decreases by 2.17%. Regarding the impact of the temperature, at discharge rate of 0.5 C, with an applied pressure of 0.2 MPa, an increase in temperature from 25 °C to 45 °C results in an increase of 4.27% in discharged capacity. The impact on performance varies significantly at different C-rates. Under the same pressure (0.2 MPa) and temperature variation (from 25 °C to 45 °C), increasing the electrical discharge rate to 1.5 C results in a 43.04% increase in discharged capacity. The interplay between temperature, pressure and C-rate has a significant, non-linear impact on performance. This suggests that the characterisation of an LIB would require the active control of both temperature and pressure during electrical operation.},

ABSTRACT = {Using different fast charging strategies for lithium-ion batteries can affect the degradation rate of the batteries. In this case, predicting the capacity fade curve can facilitate the application of new batteries. Considering the impact of fast charging strategies on battery aging, a battery capacity degradation trajectory prediction method based on the TM-Seq2Seq (Trend Matching—Sequence-to-Sequence) model is proposed. This method uses data from the first 100 cycles to predict the future capacity fade curve and EOL (end of life) in one-time. First, features are extracted from the discharge voltage-capacity curve. Secondly, a sequence-to-sequence model based on CNN, SE-net, and GRU is designed. Finally, a trend matching loss function is designed based on the common characteristics of capacity fade curves to constrain the encoding features of the sequence-to-sequence model, facilitating the learning of the underlying relationship between inputs and outputs. TM-Seq2Seq model is verified on a public dataset with 132 battery cells and multiple fast charging strategies. The experimental results indicate that, compared to other popular models, the TM-Seq2Seq model has lower prediction errors.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper addresses the control of load demand and power in a battery energy storage system (BESS) with Boolean-type constraints. It employs model predictive control (MPC) tailored for such systems. However, conventional MPC encounters computational challenges in practical applications, including battery storage control, and requires dedicated, mostly licensed solvers. To mitigate this, a solver-free yet efficient, suboptimal method is proposed. This approach involves generating randomized control sequences and assessing their feasibility to ensure adherence to constraints. The sequence with the best performance index is then selected, prioritizing feasibility and safety over optimality. Although this chosen sequence may not match the exact MPC solution in terms of optimality, it guarantees safe operation. The optimal control problem for the BESS is outlined, encompassing constraints on the state of charge, power limits, and charge/discharge modes. Three distinct scenarios evaluate the proposed method. The first prioritizes minimizing computational time, yielding a feasible solution significantly faster than the optimal approach. The second scenario strikes a balance between computational efficiency and suboptimality. The third scenario aims to minimize suboptimality while accepting longer computation times. This method’s adaptability to the user’s requirements in various scenarios and solver-free evaluation underscores its potential advantages in environments marked by stringent computational demands, a characteristic often found in BESS control applications.},

ABSTRACT = {Revolutionary and cost-effective state estimation techniques are crucial for advancing lithium-ion battery technology, especially in mobile applications. Accurate prediction of battery state-of-health (SoH) enhances state-of-charge estimation while providing valuable insights into performance, second-life utility, and safety. While recent machine learning developments show promise in SoH estimation, this paper addresses two challenges. First, many existing approaches depend on predefined charge/discharge cycles with constant current/constant voltage profiles, which limits their suitability for real-world scenarios. Second, pure time series forecasting methods require prior knowledge of the battery’s lifespan in order to formulate predictions within the time series. Our novel hybrid approach overcomes these limitations by classifying the current aging state of the cell rather than tracking the SoH. This is accomplished by analyzing current pulses filtered from authentic drive cycles. Our innovative solution employs a Long Short-Term Memory-based neural network for SoH prediction based on residual capacity, making it well suited for online electric vehicle applications. By overcoming these challenges, our hybrid approach emerges as a reliable alternative for precise SoH estimation in electric vehicle batteries, marking a significant advancement in machine learning-based SoH estimation.},

This work developed a low-cost and scalable screen-printed carbon black thermocouple to study its applicability for the thermal monitoring of LIB. Given the appropriate manufacturing parameters, it was found that thermal sensors may be printed on the electrodes, installed on a pouch cell, and once calibrated, operate with excellent sensitivity. However, to reliably use a printed carbon black thermocouple in operando of a pouch cell, its chemical resistance against electrolytes was found to require further development.},

ABSTRACT = {The long-term stability of energy-storage devices for green energy has received significant attention. Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) based on materials such as metal oxides, Si, Sb, and Sn have shown superior energy density and stability owing to their intrinsic properties and the support of conductive carbon, graphene, or graphene oxides. Abnormal capacities have been recorded for some transition metal oxides, such as NiO, Fe2O3, and MnO/Mn3O4. Recently, the restructuring of NiO into LiNiO2 anode materials has yielded an ultrastable anode for LIBs. Herein, the effect of the thin film thickness on the restructuring of the NiO anode was investigated. Different electrode thicknesses required different numbers of cycles for restructuring, resulting in significant changes in the reconstituted cells. NiO thicknesses greater than 39 μm reduced the capacity to 570 mAh g−1. The results revealed the limitation of the layered thickness owing to the low diffusion efficiency of Li ions in the thick layers, resulting in non-uniformity of the restructured LiNiO2. The NiO anode with a thickness of approximately 20 μm required only 220 cycles to be restructured at 0.5 A g−1, while maintaining a high-rate performance for over 500 cycles at 1.0 A g−1, and a high capacity of 1000 mAh g−1.},

ABSTRACT = {Layered ternary materials with high nickel content are regarded as the most promising cathode materials for high-energy-density lithium-ion batteries, owing to their advantages of high capacity, low cost, and relatively good safety. However, as the nickel content increases in ternary layered materials, their thermal stability noticeably decreases. It is of paramount importance to explore the characteristics of thermal runaway for lithium-ion batteries. In this study, two high-nickel LiNi0.9Co0.05Mn0.05O2 batteries were laterally heated to thermal runaway in a sealed chamber filled with nitrogen to investigate the thermal characteristics and gas compositions. The temperature of the battery tabs was measured, revealing that both batteries were in a critical state of thermal runaway near 120 degrees Celsius. A quantitative analysis method was employed during the eruption process, dividing it into three stages: ultra-fast, fast, and slow; the corresponding durations for the two batteries were 3, 2, 27 s and 3, 3, 26 s. By comparing the changes in chamber pressure, it was observed that both batteries exhibited a similar continuous venting duration of 32 s. However, the pressure fluctuation ranges of the two samples were 99.5 and 68.2 kPa·m·s−1. Compared to the other sample, the 211 Ah sample exhibited larger chamber pressure fluctuations and reached higher peak pressures, indicating a higher risk of explosion. In the experimental phenomenon captured by a high-speed camera, it took only 1 s for the sample to transition from the opening of the safety valve to filling the experimental chamber with smoke. The battery with higher energy density exhibited more intense eruption during thermal runaway, resulting in more severe mass loss. The mass loss of the two samples is 73% and 64.87%. The electrolyte also reacted more completely, resulting in a reduced number of measured exhaust components. The main components of gaseous ejections are CO, CO2, H2, C2H4, and CH4. For the 211 Ah battery, the vented gases were mainly composed of CO (41.3%), CO2 (24.8%), H2 (21%), C2H4 (7.4%) and CH4 (3.9%), while those for the other 256 Ah battery were mainly CO (30.6%), CO2 (28.5%), H2 (21.7%), C2H4 (12.4%) and CH4 (5.8%). Comparatively, the higher-capacity battery produced more gases. The gas volumes, converted to standard conditions (0 °C, 101 kPa) and normalized, resulted in 1.985 L/Ah and 2.182 L/Ah, respectively. The results provide valuable guidance for the protection of large-capacity, high-energy-density battery systems. The quantitative analysis of the eruption process has provided assistance to fire alarm systems and firefighting strategies.},

ABSTRACT = {Inconsistency is a key factor triggering safety problems in battery packs. The inconsistency evaluation of retired batteries is of great significance to ensure the safe and stable operation of batteries during subsequent gradual use. This paper summaries the commonly used diagnostic methods for battery inconsistency assessment. The local outlier factor (LOF) algorithm and the improved Shannon entropy (ImEn) algorithm are selected for validation based on the individual voltage data from real-world vehicles. Then, a comprehensive inconsistency evaluation strategy for retired batteries with many levels and indicators is established based on the three parameters of LOF, ImEn, and cell voltage range. Finally, the evaluation strategy is validated using two real-world vehicle samples of retired batteries. The results show that the proposed method can achieve the inconsistency evaluation of retired batteries quickly and effectively.},

ABSTRACT = {Maintaining batteries within a specific temperature range is vital for safety and efficiency, as extreme temperatures can degrade a battery’s performance and lifespan. In addition, battery temperature is the key parameter in battery safety regulations. Battery thermal management systems (BTMSs) are pivotal in regulating battery temperature. While current BTMSs offer real-time temperature monitoring, their lack of predictive capability poses a limitation. This study introduces a novel hybrid system that combines a machine learning-based battery temperature prediction model with an online battery parameter identification unit. The identification unit continuously updates the battery’s electrical parameters in real time, enhancing the prediction model’s accuracy. The prediction model employs an Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) and considers various input parameters, such as ambient temperature, the battery’s current temperature, internal resistance, and open-circuit voltage. The model accurately predicts the battery’s future temperature in a finite time horizon by dynamically adjusting thermal and electrical parameters based on real-time data. Experimental tests are conducted on Li-ion (NCA and LFP) cylindrical cells across a range of ambient temperatures to validate the system’s accuracy under varying conditions, including state of charge and a dynamic load current. The proposed models prioritise simplicity to ensure real-time industrial applicability.},

ABSTRACT = {Thermal runaway (TR) of lithium-ion batteries has always been a topic of concern, and the safety of batteries is closely related to the operating temperature. An overheated battery can significantly impact the surrounding batteries, increasing the risk of fire and explosion. To improve the safety of battery modules and prevent TR, we focus on the characteristics of temperature distribution and thermal spread of battery modules under overheating conditions. The heat transfer characteristics of battery modules under different battery thermal management systems (BTMSs) are assessed. In addition, the effects of abnormal heat generation rate, abnormal heat generation location, and ambient temperature on the temperature distribution and thermal spread of battery modules are also studied. The results indicate that the BTMS consisting of flat heat pipes (FHPs) and bottom and side liquid cooling plates can effectively suppress thermal spread and improve the safety of the battery module.},

ABSTRACT = {A reliable and accurate estimation of the state-of-health (SOH) of lithium batteries is critical to safely operating electric vehicles and other equipment. This paper proposes a state-of-health estimation method based on fennec fox optimization algorithm–mixed extreme learning machine (FFA-MELM). Firstly, health indicators are extracted from lithium-battery-charging data, and grey relational analysis (GRA) is employed to identify highly correlated features with the state-of-health of the battery. Subsequently, a state-of-health estimation model based on mixed extreme learning machine is constructed, and the hyperparameters of the model are optimized using the fennec fox optimization algorithm to improve estimation accuracy and convergence speed. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method has significantly improved the accuracy of the state-of-health estimation for lithium batteries compared to the extreme learning machine. Furthermore, it can achieve precise state-of-health estimation results for multiple batteries, even under complex operating conditions and with limited charge/discharge cycle data.},

ABSTRACT = {Batteries have been considered a key element in several applications, ranging from grid-scale storage systems through electric vehicles to daily-use small-scale electronic devices. However, excessive charging and discharging will impair their capabilities and could cause their applications to fail catastrophically. Among several diagnostic indices, state-of-charge estimation is essential for evaluating a battery’s capabilities. Various approaches have been introduced to reach this target, including white, gray, and black box or data-driven battery models. The main objective of this work is to provide an extensive comparison of currently highly utilized machine learning-based estimation techniques. The paper thoroughly investigates these models’ architectures, computational burdens, advantages, drawbacks, and robustness validation. The evaluation’s main criteria were based on measurements recorded under various operating conditions at the Energy Systems Research Laboratory (ESRL) at FIU for the eFlex 52.8 V/5.4 kWh lithium iron phosphate battery pack. The primary outcome of this research is that, while the random forest regression (RFR) model emerges as the most effective tool for SoC estimation in lithium-ion batteries, there is potential to enhance the performance of simpler models through strategic adjustments and optimizations. Additionally, the choice of model ultimately depends on the specific requirements of the task at hand, balancing the need for accuracy with the complexity and computational resources available and how it can be merged with other SoC estimation approaches to achieve high precision.},

ABSTRACT = {The increasing adoption of lithium-ion battery cells in contemporary energy storage applications has raised concerns regarding their potential hazards. Ensuring the safety of compact and modern energy storage systems over their operational lifespans necessitates precise and dependable monitoring techniques. This research introduces a novel method for the cell-specific surveillance of prismatic lithium-ion cells, with a focus on detecting pressure increases through the surface application of a fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensor on a rupture disc. Commercially available prismatic cells, commonly used in the automotive sector, are employed as test specimens and equipped with proven pressure and innovative FBG sensors. Encompassing the analysis capacity, internal resistance, and pressure (under elevated ambient temperatures of up to 120 °C), this investigation explores the thermal degradation effects. The applied FBG sensor on the rupture disc exhibits reversible and irreversible state changes in the cells, offering a highly sensitive and reliable monitoring solution for the early detection of abuse and post-abuse cell condition analysis. This innovative approach represents a practical implementation of fiber optic sensor technology that is designed for strain-based monitoring of prismatic lithium-ion cells, thereby enabling customized solutions through which to address safety challenges in prismatic cell applications. In alignment with the ongoing exploration of lithium-ion batteries, this research offers a customizable addition to battery monitoring and fault detection.},

ABSTRACT = {Layered oxides exhibit interesting performance as positive electrodes for commercial sodium-ion batteries. Nevertheless, the replacement of low-sustainable nickel with more abundant iron would be desirable. Although it can be achieved in P2-Na2/3Ni2/9Fe2/9Mn5/9O2, its performance still requires further improvement. Many imaginative strategies such as surface modification have been proposed to minimize undesirable interactions at the cathode–electrolyte interface while facilitating sodium insertion in different materials. Here, we examine four different approaches based on the use of the electron-conductive polymer poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene) (PEDOT) as an additive: (i) electrochemical in situ polymerization of the monomer, (ii) manual mixing with the active material, (iii) coating the current collector, and (iv) a combination of the latter two methods. As compared with pristine layered oxide, the electrochemical performance shows a particularly effective way of increasing cycling stability by using electropolymerization. Contrarily, the mixtures show less improvement, probably due to the heterogeneous distribution of oxide and polymer in the samples. In contrast with less conductive polyanionic cathode materials such as phosphates, the beneficial effects of PEDOT on oxide cathodes are not as much in rate performance as in inhibiting cycling degradation, due to the compactness of the electrodes without loss of electrical contact between active particles.},

ABSTRACT = {The impact of global warming has required the development of efficient new types of batteries. One of the most promising is Zn-O2 batteries because they provide the second biggest theoretical energy density, with relevant safety and a cycle of life long enough to be fitted for massive use. However, their industrial use is hindered by a series of obstacles, such as a fast reduction in the energy density after the initial charge and discharge cycles and a limited cathode efficiency or an elevated overpotential between discharge and charge. This work is focused on the synthesis of titanium compounds as catalyzers for the cathode of a Zn-O2 aqueous battery and their characterization. The results have shown a surface area of 350 m2/g after the elimination of the organic templates during heat treatment at 500 °C in air. Different thermal treatments were performed, tuning different parameters, such as intermediate treatment at 500 °C or the atmosphere used and the final temperature. Surface areas remain high for samples without an intermediate temperature step of 500 °C. Raman spectroscopy studies confirmed the nitridation of samples. SEM and XRD showed macro–meso-porosity and the presence of nitrogen, and the electrochemical evaluation confirmed the catalytic properties of this material in oxygen reaction reduction (ORR)/oxygen evolution reaction (OER) analysis and Zn-O2 battery tests.},

ABSTRACT = {Despite the variety of solid electrolytes available, no single solid electrolyte has been found that meets all the requirements of the successor technology of lithium-ion batteries in an optimum way. However, composite hybrid electrolytes that combine the desired properties such as high ionic conductivity or stability against lithium are promising. The addition of conductive oxide fillers to sulfide solid electrolytes has been reported to increase ionic conductivity and improve stability relative to the individual electrolytes, but the influence of the mixing process to create composite electrolytes has not been investigated. Here, we investigate Li3PS4 (LPS) and Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) composite electrolytes using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and distribution of relaxation times. The distinction between sulfide bulk and grain boundary polarization processes is possible with the methods used at temperatures below 10 °C. We propose lithium transport through the space-charge layer within the sulfide electrolyte, which increases the conductivity. With increasing mixing intensities in a high-energy ball mill, we show an overlay of the enhanced lithium-ion transport with the structural change of the sulfide matrix component, which increases the ionic conductivity of LPS from 4.1 × 10−5 S cm−1 to 1.7 × 10−4 S cm−1.},

ABSTRACT = {Despite features of cost-effectiveness, high safety, and superior capacity, aqueous zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs) have issues of uncontrolled dendritic cell failure and poor Zn utilization, resulting in inferior cycling reversibility. Herein, the environmentally friendly and naturally abundant sodium citrate (SC) was adopted as a dual-functional additive for ZnSO4-based (ZSO) electrolytes. Owing to the abundant hydrogen-bond donors and hydrogen-bond acceptors of SC, the Zn2+-solvation shell is interrupted to facilitate Zn desolvation, resulting in inhibited corrosion reactions. Additionally, sodium ions (Na+) from the SC additive with a lower effective reduction potential than that of zinc ions (Zn2+) form an electrostatic shield inhibiting the formation of initial surface protuberances and subsequent Zn dendrite growth. This assists in the Zn three-dimensional (3D) diffusion and deposition, thereby effectively enhancing cycling stability. Specifically, a long cycling lifespan (more than 760 h) of the Zn//Zn symmetric cell is achieved with a 2 M ZSO-1.0 SC electrolyte at a current density of 1 mA cm−2. When coupled with the NaV3O8·1.5 H2O (NVO) cathode, the full battery containing SC additive exhibited a capacity retention rate (40.0%) and a cycling life of 400 cycles at a current density of 1 A g−1 compared with that of pure ZnSO4 electrolyte (23.8%). This work provides a protocol for selecting an environmentally friendly and naturally abundant dual-functional electrolyte additive to achieve solvation shell regulation and Zn anode protection for the practical large-scale application of ZIBs.},

ABSTRACT = {Predicting the operating temperature of lithium-ion battery during different cycles is important when it comes to the safety and efficiency of electric vehicles. In this regard, it is vital to adopt a suitable modeling approach to analyze the thermal performance of a battery. In this paper, the temperature of lithium-ion NMC pouch battery has been investigated. A new formulation of lumped model based on the thermal resistance network is proposed. Unlike previous models that treated the battery as a single entity, the proposed model introduces a more detailed analysis by incorporating thermal interactions between individual cells and tabs within a single cell scenario, while also considering interactions between cells and insulators or gaps, located between the cells, within the module case. This enhancement allows for the precise prediction of temperature variations across different cells implemented within the battery module. In order to evaluate the accuracy of the prediction, a three-dimensional finite element model was adopted as a reference. The study was performed first on a single cell, then on modules composed of several cells connected in series, during different operating conditions. A comprehensive comparison between both models was conducted. The analysis focused on two main aspects, the accuracy of temperature predictions and the computational time required. Notably, the developed lumped model showed a significant capability to estimate cell temperatures within the modules. The thermal results revealed close agreement with the values predicted by the finite element model, while needing significantly lower computational time. For instance, while the finite element model took almost 21 h to predict the battery temperature during consecutive charge/discharge cycles of a 10-cell module, the developed lumped model predicted the temperature within seconds, with a maximum difference of 0.42 °C.},

ABSTRACT = {In this study, we investigate the use of artificial neural networks as a potentially efficient method to determine the rate capability of electrodes for lithium-ion batteries with different porosities. The performance of a lithium-ion battery is, to a large extent, determined by the microstructure (i.e., layer thickness and porosity) of its electrodes. Tailoring the microstructure to a specific application is a crucial process in battery development. However, unravelling the complex correlations between microstructure and rate performance using either experiments or simulations is time-consuming and costly. Our approach provides a swift method for predicting the rate capability of battery electrodes by using machine learning on microstructural images of electrode cross-sections. We train multiple models in order to predict the specific capacity based on the batteries’ microstructure and investigate the decisive parts of the microstructure through the use of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods. Our study shows that even comparably small neural network architectures are capable of providing state-of-the-art prediction results. In addition to this, our XAI studies demonstrate that the models are using understandable human features while ignoring present artefacts.},

ABSTRACT = {The aqueous processing of cathode materials for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) has both environmental and cost benefits. However, high-loading, water-based electrodes from the layered oxides (e.g., NMC) typically exhibit worse electrochemical performance than NMP-based electrodes. In this work, primary, binary, and ternary binder mixtures of aqueous binders such as CMC, PAA, PEO, SBR, and Na alginate, in combination with bare and C-coated Al current collectors, were explored, aiming to improve the rate capability performance of NMC811 electrodes with high areal capacity (≥4 mAh cm−2) and low binder content (3 wt.%). Electrodes with a ternary binder composition (CMC:PAA:SBR) have the best performance with bare Al current collectors, attaining a specific capacity of 150 mAh g−1 at 1C. Using carbon-coated Al current collectors results in improved performance for both water- and NMP-based electrodes. This is further accentuated for Na-Alg and CMC:PAA binder compositions. These electrodes show specific capacities of 170 and 80 mAh g−1 at 1C and 2C, respectively. Although the specific capacities at 1C are comparable to those for NMP-PVDF electrodes, they are approximately 50% higher at the 2C rate. This study aims to contribute to the development of sustainably processed NMC electrodes for high energy density LIBs using water as solvent.},

ABSTRACT = {The zinc anode mainly faces technical problems such as short circuits caused by the growth of dendrite, low coulomb efficiency, and a short cycle life caused by side reactions, which impedes the rapid development of aqueous zinc-ion batteries (AZIBs). Herein, a common ionic liquid, 1,1-Spirobipyrrolidinium tetrafluoroborate ([SBP]BF4), is selected as a new additive for pure ZnSO4 electrolyte. It is found that this additive could regulate the solvation sheath of hydrated Zn2+ ions, promote the ionic mobility of Zn2+, homogenize the flux of Zn2+, avoid side reactions between the electrolyte and electrode, and inhibit the production of zinc dendrites by facilitating the establishment of an inorganic solid electrolyte interphase layer. With the 1% [SBP]BF4-modified electrolyte, the Zn||Zn symmetric cell delivers an extended plating/stripping cycling life of 2000 h at 1 mA cm−2, which is much higher than that of the cell without additives (330 h). As a proof of concept, the Zn‖V2O5 battery using the [SBP]BF4 additive shows excellent cycling stability, maintaining its specific capacity at 97 mAh g−1 after 2000 cycles at 5 A g−1, which is much greater than the 46 mAh g−1 capacity of the non-additive battery. This study offers zinc anode stabilization through high-efficiency electrolyte engineering.},

ABSTRACT = {As the Electric Vehicle market grows, understanding the implications of battery degradation on the driving experience is key to fostering trust among users and improving End of Life estimations. This study analyses various road types, charging behaviours and Electric Vehicle models to evaluate the impact of degradation on the performance. Key indicators related to the speed, acceleration, driving times and regenerative capabilities are obtained for different degradation levels to quantify the performance decay. Results show that the impact is highly dependent on the road type and nominal battery capacity. Vehicles with long and medium ranges show a robust performance for common driving conditions. Short-range vehicles perform adequately in urban and rural road conditions, but on highways, speed and acceleration reductions of up to 6.7 km/h and 3.96 (km/h)/s have been observed. The results of this study suggest that degradation should not be a concern for standard driving conditions and mid- and long-range vehicles currently dominate the market. In addition, the results are used to define a functional End of Life criterion based on performance loss, beyond the oversimplified 70–80% State-of-Health threshold, which does not consider individual requirements.},

ABSTRACT = {The ubiquitous deployment of Li-ion batteries (LIBs) in more demanding applications has reinforced the need to understand the root causes of thermal runaway. Herein, we perform a forensic simulation of a real-case failure scenario, using localised heating of Li(Ni0.5Mn0.3Co0.2)O2 versus graphite 18650 cylindrical cells. This study determined the localised temperatures that would lead to venting and thermal runaway of these cells, as well as correlating the gases produced as a function of the degradation pathway. Catastrophic failure, involving melting (with internal cell temperatures exceeding 1085 °C), deformation and ejection of the cell componentry, was induced by locally applying 200 °C and 250 °C to a fully charged cell. Conversely, catastrophic failure was not observed when the same temperatures were applied to the cells at a lower state of charge (SOC). This work highlights the importance of SOC, chemistry and heat in driving the thermal failure mode of Ni-rich LIB cells, allowing for a better understanding of battery safety and the associated design improvements.},

ABSTRACT = {The automotive industry aims for the highest possible driving range (highest energy density) in combination with a fast charge ability (highest power density) of electric vehicles. With both targets being intrinsically contradictory, it is important to understand and optimize resistances within lithium-ion battery (LIB) electrodes. In this study, the properties and magnitude of electronic resistance contributions in LiMn0.7Fe0.3PO4 (LMFP)- and LiNixCoyMnzO2 (NCM, x = 0.88~0.90, x + y + z = 1)-based electrodes are comprehensively investigated through the use of different measurement methods. Contact resistance properties are characterized via electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) on the example of LMFP cathodes. The EIS results are compared to a two-point probe as well as to the results obtained using a novel commercial 46-point probe system. The magnitude and ratio of contact resistance and compound electronic resistance for LMFP- and NCM-based cathodes are discussed on the basis of the 46-point probe measurement results. The results show that the 46-point probe yields significantly lower resistance values than those in EIS studies. Further results show that electronic resistance values in cathodes can vary over several orders of magnitude. Various influence parameters such as electrode porosity, type of current collector and the impact of solvent soaking on electronic resistance are investigated.},

This study empirically investigates the impact of ambient temperature, charge/discharge rate, and charge/discharge cut-off voltage on the capacity degradation rate and internal resistance growth of 18,650 commercial LIBs. The charge/discharge rate was found to have the most significant influence on these parameters, particularly the charging rate.

ABSTRACT = {With the proliferation of electric vehicles (EVs) and the consequential increase in EV battery circulation, the need for accurate assessments of battery health and remaining useful life (RUL) is paramount, driven by environmentally friendly and sustainable goals. This study addresses this pressing concern by employing data-driven methods, specifically harnessing deep learning techniques to enhance RUL estimation for lithium-ion batteries (LIB). Leveraging the Toyota Research Institute Dataset, consisting of 124 lithium-ion batteries cycled to failure and encompassing key metrics such as capacity, temperature, resistance, and discharge time, our analysis substantially improves RUL prediction accuracy. Notably, the convolutional long short-term memory deep neural network (CLDNN) model and the transformer LSTM (temporal transformer) model have emerged as standout remaining useful life (RUL) predictors. The CLDNN model, in particular, achieved a remarkable mean absolute error (MAE) of 84.012 and a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 25.676. Similarly, the temporal transformer model exhibited a notable performance, with an MAE of 85.134 and a MAPE of 28.7932. These impressive results were achieved by applying Bayesian hyperparameter optimization, further enhancing the accuracy of predictive methods. These models were bench-marked against existing approaches, demonstrating superior results with an improvement in MAPE ranging from 4.01% to 7.12%.},

ABSTRACT = {In vanadium redox flow batteries, the flow field geometry plays a dramatic role on the distribution of the electrolyte and its design results from the trade-off between high battery performance and low pressure drops. In the literature, it was demonstrated that electrolyte permeation through the porous electrode is mainly regulated by pressure difference between adjacent channels, leading to the presence of under-the-rib fluxes. With the support of a 3D computational fluid dynamic model, this work presents two novel flow field geometries that are designed to tune the direction of the pressure gradients between channels in order to promote the under-the-rib fluxes mechanism. The first geometry is named Two Outlets and exploits the splitting of the electrolyte flow into two adjacent interdigitated layouts with the aim to give to the pressure gradient a more transverse direction with respect to the channels, raising the intensity of under-the-rib fluxes and making their distribution more uniform throughout the electrode area. The second geometry is named Four Inlets and presents four inlets located at the corners of the distributor, with an interdigitated-like layout radially oriented from each inlet to one single central outlet, with the concept of reducing the heterogeneity of the flow velocity within the electrode. Subsequently, flow fields performance is verified experimentally adopting a segmented hardware in symmetric cell configuration with positive electrolyte, which permits the measurement of local current distribution and local electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Compared to a conventional interdigitated geometry, both the developed configurations permit a significant decrease in the pressure drops without any reduction in battery performance. In the Four Inlets flow field the pressure drop reduction is more evident (up to 50%) due to the lower electrolyte velocities in the feeding channels, while the Two Outlets configuration guarantees a more homogeneous current density distribution.},

ABSTRACT = {The improvement of fast-charging capabilities for lithium-ion batteries significantly influences the widespread application of electric vehicles. Fast-charging performance depends not only on materials but also on the battery’s inherent structure and the heterogeneity of the electrode reaction. Herein, we utilized advanced imaging techniques to explore how the internal structure of cylindrical batteries impacts macroscopic electrochemical performance. Our research unveiled the natural 3D structural non-uniformity of the electrodes, causing heterogeneity of electrode reaction. This non-uniformity of reaction exhibited a macro–meso–micro-scale feature in four dimensions: the exterior versus the interior of the electrode, the middle versus the sides of the cell, the inside versus the outside of the cell, and the surface versus the body of the electrode. Furthermore, the single-coated side of the anode demonstrated notably faster reaction than the double-coated sides, leading to the deposition of island-like lithium during fast charging. These discoveries offer novel insights into multi-scale fast-charging mechanisms for commercial batteries, inspiring innovative approaches to battery design.},

ABSTRACT = {Rapid technological changes and disruptive innovations have resulted in a significant shift in people’s behavior and requirements. Electronic gadgets, including smartphones, notebooks, and other devices, are indispensable to everyday routines. Consequently, the demand for high-capacity batteries has surged, which has enabled extended device autonomy. An alternative approach to address this demand is battery swapping, which can potentially extend the battery life of electronic devices. Although battery sharing in electric vehicles has been well studied, smartphone applications still need to be explored. Crucially, assessing the batteries’ state of health (SoH) presents a challenge, necessitating consensus on the best estimation methods to develop effective battery swap strategies. This paper proposes a model for estimating the SoH curve of lithium-ion batteries using the state of charge curve. The model was designed for smartphone battery swap applications utilizing Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) neural networks. To validate the model, a system was developed to conduct destructive tests on batteries and study their behavior over their lifetimes. The results demonstrated the high precision of the model in estimating the SoH of batteries under various charge and discharge parameters. The proposed approach exhibits low computational complexity, low cost, and easily measurable input parameters, making it an attractive solution for smartphone battery swap applications.},

ABSTRACT = {Effectively extracting a lithium-ion battery’s impedance is of great importance for various onboard applications, which requires consideration of both the time consumption and accuracy of the measurement process. Although the pseudorandom binary sequence (PRBS) excitation signal can inject the superposition frequencies with high time efficiency and an easily implementable device, processing the data of the battery’s impedance measurement is still a challenge at present. This study proposes a fast impedance spectrum construction method for lithium-ion batteries, where a multi-density clustering algorithm was designed to effectively extract the useful impedance after PRBS injection. According to the distribution properties of the measurement points by PRBS, a density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) was used for processing the data of the lithium-ion battery’s impedance. The two key parameters of the DBSCAN were adjusted by a delicate workflow according to the frequency range. The validation of the proposed method was proved on a 3 Ah lithium-ion battery under nine different test conditions, considering both the SOC and temperature variations.},

ABSTRACT = {As electric vehicles (EVs) gain market dominance, ensuring safety during the battery usage is crucial. This paper presents a new thermal management approach to address the battery heat accumulation challenge through a novel combination of composite phase change material (CPCM) with liquid cooling systems. An optimised hybrid cooling model is developed to evaluate the proposed battery thermal management system (BTMS) under high-temperature and high-power conditions. Benchmark studies are conducted to assess the impact of inlet position, inlet flow rate, and flow channel distribution on the cooling performance to achieve a uniform temperature distribution within the battery. The optimised BTMS, consisting of a five-cell battery pack, demonstrates a maximum temperature of 41.15 °C and a temperature difference of 4.89 °C in a operating condition at 36 °C with a discharge rate of 3 C. The BTMS outperforms the initial model, reducing the maximum temperature by 1.5%, temperature difference by 5%, and liquid fraction by 13%, with a slight (1.3%) increase in weight. The cooling performance is most efficient at a liquid flow rate of 0.1 m/s, minimising energy consumption. The proposed BTMS with CPCM-3 is also sufficient enough to keep the battery pack under a thermal runaway event. Overall, the theoretical simulation highlights the BTMS’s ability to effectively control battery temperatures and temperature differences, ensuring safe operation during high-temperature and high-power conditions in practical EV usage.},

ABSTRACT = {As a successor to LiFePO4, the research interest in LiMn1−yFeyPO4 has been sustained due to its higher working voltage and safety features. However, its further application is limited by the low compaction density caused by uncontrolled particle size. In this study, the high-quality LiMn0.69Co0.01Fe0.3PO4 (LMFP) materials were prepared using the freeze-drying method to process the LMFP precursor synthesized through a solvothermal crystallization method followed by a calcination process at different temperatures (400–550 °C). The results demonstrate that the obtained particles exhibit a spheroidal shape with a low specific surface area after secondary crystallization calcination at 700 °C. The compaction density increased from 1.96 g/cm3 for LMFP precursor (LMFP-M1) to 2.18, 2.27, 2.34, and 2.43 g/cm3 for samples calcined at 400, 450, 500 and 550 °C, respectively, achieving a maximum increase of 24%. The full cell constructed with the high-compaction-density material calcined at 500 °C displayed discharge capacities of 144.1, 143.8, and 142.6 mAh/g at 0.5, 1, and 3 C rates, respectively, with a retention rate of 99% at 3 C rate. After undergoing charging and discharging cycles at a rate of 1 C for up to 800 cycles, the capacity retention rate was found to be 90%, indicating an expected full cell life span exceeding 2500 cycles.},

ABSTRACT = {While thermal runaway characterization and prediction is an important aspect of lithium-ion battery engineering and development, it is a requirement to ensure that a battery system can be safe under normal operations and during failure events. This study investigated the current existing literature regarding lithium-ion battery thermal runaway characterization and predictive modeling methods. A thermal model for thermal runaway prediction was adapted from the literature and is presented in this paper along with a comparison of empirical data and predicted data using the model. Empirical data were collected from a Samsung 30Q 18650 cylindrical cell and from a large 20 Ah pouch cell format using accelerated rate calorimetry. The predictive model was executed in a macro-enabled Microsoft Excel workbook for simplicity and accessibility for the public. The primary purpose of using more primitive modeling software was to provide an accurate model that was generally accessible without the purchase of or training in a specific modeling software package. The modes of heat transfer during the thermal runaway event were studied and are reported in this work, along with insights on thermal management during a thermal runaway failure event.},

ABSTRACT = {Graphite anode materials and carbonate electrolyte have been the top choices for commercial lithium-ion batteries (LIBS) for a long time. However, the uneven deposition and stripping of lithium cause irreversible damage to the graphite structure, and the low flash point and high flammability of the carbonate electrolyte pose a significant fire safety risk. Here, we proposed a multifunctional electrolyte additive diphenylphosphoryl azide (DPPA), which can construct a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) with high ionic conductivity lithium nitride (Li3N) to ensure efficient transport of Li+. This not only protects the artificial graphite (AG) electrode but also inhibits lithium dendrites to achieve excellent electrochemical performance. Meanwhile, the LIBS with DPPA offers satisfactory flame retardancy performance. The AG//Li half cells with DPPA-0.5M can still maintain a specific capacity of about 350 mAh/g after 200 cycles at 0.2 C. Its cycle performance and rate performance were better than commercial electrolyte (EC/DMC). After cycling, the microstructure surface of the AG electrode was complete and flat, and the surface of the lithium metal electrode had fewer lithium dendrites. Importantly, we found that the pouch cell with DPPA-0.5M had low peak heat release rate. When exposed to external conditions of continuous heating, DPPA significantly improved the fire safety of the LIBS. The research of DPPA in lithium electrolyte is a step towards the development of safe and efficient lithium batteries.},

ABSTRACT = {As the use of Li-ion batteries is spreading, incidents in large energy storage systems (stationary storage containers, etc.) or in large-scale cell and battery storages (warehouses, recyclers, etc.), often leading to fire, are occurring on a regular basis. Water remains one of the most efficient fire extinguishing agents for tackling such battery incidents, and large quantities are usually necessary. Since batteries contain various potentially harmful components (metals and their oxides or salts, solvents, etc.) and thermal-runaway-induced battery incidents are accompanied by complex and potentially multistage fume emissions (containing both gas and particles), the potential impact of fire run-off waters on the environment should be considered and assessed carefully. The tests presented in this paper focus on analyzing the composition of run-off waters used to spray NMC Li-ion modules under thermal runaway. It highlights that waters used for firefighting are susceptible to containing many metals, including Ni, Mn, Co, Li and Al, mixed with other carbonaceous species (soot, tarballs) and sometimes undecomposed solvents used in the electrolyte. Extrapolation of pollutant concentrations compared with PNEC values showed that, for large-scale incidents, run-off water could be potentially hazardous to the environment.},

ABSTRACT = {Second-life applications for lithium-ion batteries offer industry opportunities to defer recycling costs, enhance economic value, and reduce environmental impacts. However, cells are affected by numerous aging phenomena which can lead to an acceleration in capacity loss. This paper uses postmortem techniques to compare aging phenomenon in 1.1 Ah 18650 graphite/LFP cells, examining the differences between a pristine cell and three cells aged to 40~30% of state of health (SoH). Macroscopic and microscopic techniques are used to identify aging phenomenon occurring in the cell on both positive and negative electrodes. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS) and scanning electron microscopes (SEMs) with back-scattered electron (BSE) detector are used to analyze each electrode. These methods are used to analyze the morphology and the material on each electrode. The results show a stable positive LFP electrode whereas numerous deposits and cracking occurred on the negative electrode. A discussion of the appearance of those aging phenomenon is presented. Impacts for industrial cells in second-life applications are finally discussed.},

ABSTRACT = {The demand for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) is driven by environmental concerns and market growth, particularly in the transportation sector. The EU’s push for net-zero emissions and the European Green Deal accentuates the role of battery technologies in sustainable energy supply. Organic acids, like gluconic acid, are explored for the eco-friendly leaching of valuable metals from spent batteries. This study investigates leaching kinetics using gluconic acid (hydrolyzed glucono-1.5-lacton), analyzing factors such as temperature, acid concentration, particle size, and reaction time. Results reveal the temperature’s influence on leaching efficiency for cobalt, nickel, and lithium. The mechanism for Co follows a surface chemical reaction model with an activation energy of 28.2 kJ·mol−1. Nickel, on the contrary, shows a diffusion-controlled regime and an activation energy of 70.1 kJ·mol−1. The reaction of leaching Ni and Co using gluconic acid was determined to be first-order.

ABSTRACT = {Developing cost-effective cathode materials is conducive to accelerating the commercialization of sodium-ion batteries. Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7 (NFPP) has attracted extensive attention owning to its high theoretical capacity, stable structure, and low cost of raw materials. However, its inherent low conductivity hinders its further application. Herein, carbon-coated NFPP nanospheres are anchored to crumpled MXene nanosheets by an electrostatic self-assembly; this cross-linked structure induced by CTAB not only significantly expands the contact area between particles and improves the electronic conductivity, but also effectively reduces the aggregation of NFPP nanoparticles. The as-designed Na4Fe3(PO4)2(P2O7)@C/Ti3C2Tx (NFPP@MX) cathode exhibits a high discharge capacity (106.1 mAh g−1 g at 0.2 C), good rate capability (60.4 mAh g−1 at 10 C), and a long-life cyclic stability (85.2% capacity retention after 1000 cycles at 1 C). This study provides an effective strategy for the massive production of high-performance NFPP cathodes and broadens the application of MXene in the modification of other cathode materials.},

ABSTRACT = {The aim of this study is to investigate new materials that can be employed as cathode hosts in Li-S batteries, which would be able to overcome the effect of the shuttling of soluble polysulfides and maximize the battery capacity and energy density. Density functional theory (DFT) simulations are used to determine the adsorption energy of lithium sulfides in two types of cathode hosts: lithiated 1T-MoS2 (1T-LixMoS2) and hybrid 1T-LixMoS2/graphene. Initial simulations of lithiated 1T-MoS2 structures led to the selection of an optimized 1T-Li0.75MoS2 structure, which was utilized for the formation of an optimized 1T-Li0.75MoS2 bilayer and a hybrid 1T-Li0.75MoS2/graphene bilayer structure. It was found that all sulfides exhibited super-high adsorption energies in the interlayer inside the 1T-Li0.75MoS2 bilayer and very good adsorption energy values in the interlayer inside the hybrid 1T-Li0.75MoS2/graphene bilayer. The placement of sulfides outside each type of bilayer, over the 1T-Li0.75MoS2 surface, yielded good adsorption energies in the range of −2 to −3.8 eV, which are higher than those over a 1T-MoS2 substrate.},

ABSTRACT = {Block copolymers (BCPs) as solid electrolytes for batteries are usually designed to have an ion-solvating block for ion conduction and an ionophobic block for providing mechanical strength. Here, we show a novel solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) for sodium batteries based on a poly(vinyl benzoate)-b-poly(diallyldimethyl ammonium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide) PVBx-b-PDADMATFSIy-b-PVBx ABA triblock copolymer. The SPE triblock copolymer comprises a polymerized ionic liquid (PIL) ion-solvating block combined with NaFSI salt as an internal block and an ionophilic PVB as an external block. Four distinct compositions with varying chain lengths of the blocks were synthesized by reversible addition−fragmentation chain-transfer (RAFT) polymerization. The neat copolymers were subsequently mixed with NaFSI in a 2:1 mol ratio of Na to ionic monomer units. Through comprehensive analysis using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), it was revealed that the ion coordination within the polymer–salt mixtures undergoes changes based on the composition of the starting neat polymer. Electrochemical evaluations identified the optimal composition for practical application as PVB11.5K-b-PDADMATFSI33K-b-PVB11.5K, showing an ionic conductivity at 70 °C of 4.2 × 10−5 S cm−1. This polymer electrolyte formulation was investigated for sodium in Na|Na symmetrical cells, showing an overpotential of 200 mV at 70 °C at 0.1 mA cm−2. When applied in a sodium–air battery, the polymer electrolyte membrane achieved a discharge capacity of 1.59 mAh cm−2 at 50 °C.},

ABSTRACT = {To estimate the state of health, charge, power, and safety (SoX) of lithium-ion batteries (LiBs) in real time, battery management systems (BMSs) need accurate and efficient battery models. The full-order partial two-dimensional (P2D) model is a common physics-based cell-level LiB model that faces challenges for real-time BMS implementation due to the complexity of its numerical solver. In this paper, we propose a method to discretise the P2D model equations using the Finite Volume and Verlet Integration Methods to significantly reduce the computational complexity of the solver. Our proposed iterative solver uses novel convergence criteria and physics-based initial guesses to provide high fidelity for discretised P2D equations. We also include both the kinetic-limited and diffusion-limited models for Solid Electrolyte Interface (SEI) growth into an iterative P2D solver. With these SEI models, we can estimate the capacity fade in real time once the model is tuned to the cell–voltage curve. The results are validated using three different operation scenarios, including the 1C discharge/charge cycle, multiple-C-rate discharges, and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory dynamic stress test. The proposed solver shows at least a 4.5 times improvement in performance with less than 1% error when compared to commercial solvers.},

ABSTRACT = {Aiming at the electrical safety problem of a high-voltage lithium-ion battery system caused by an arc, and based on the establishment of a battery arc fault experimental platform, the evolution law of safety caused by an arc in the negative terminal of a battery system under different working conditions is discussed. On this basis, a battery arc evolution model based on magnetohydrodynamics is established to analyze the arc’s electro-thermal coupling characteristics to further obtain the distribution of the arc’s multi-physical field. The results show that the arc generated by the high-voltage grade battery pack will break down the cell’s shell and form a hole, resulting in electrolyte leakage. When the loop current is 10 A, the evolution law of arc voltage and current is basically the same under different supply voltages, charges, and discharges. The accuracy of the battery arc simulation model is verified by comparing the simulation with the experimental results. The research in this paper provides a theoretical basis for the electrical safety design of lithium-ion batteries caused by the arc, fills the gaps in the field of battery system arc simulation, and is of great significance for improving the safety performance of arc protection.},

ABSTRACT = {The aging of supercapacitors (SCs) depends on several factors, with temperature being one of the most important. When this is high, degradation of the electrolyte occurs. The impurities generated in its decomposition reduce the accessibility of the ions to the porous structure on the surface of the electrode, which reduces its capacity and increases its internal resistance. In some applications, such as electric vehicles whose storage system consists of SCs, fast chargers, which supply very high power, are used. This can lead to an increase in temperature and accelerated aging of the cells. Therefore, it is important to know how the temperature of the SCs evolves in these cases and what parameters it depends on, both electrical and thermal. In this contribution, mathematical formulae have been developed to determine the evolution of the temperature in time and its maximum value during the transient state. The formulae for obtaining the mean and maximum temperature, once the thermal steady state (TSS) has been reached, are also shown, considering that the charger cells are recharged from the grid at a constant current. Based on this formulation, the thermal analysis of a specific case is determined.},

ABSTRACT = {Lithium-ion batteries are widely used in modern society as important energy storage devices due to their high energy density, rechargeable performance, and light weight. However, the capacity and performance of lithium-ion batteries gradually degrade with the number of charge or discharge cycles and environmental conditions, which can affect the reliability and lifetime of the batteries, so it is necessary to accurately evaluate their health. The belief rule base (BRB) model is an evaluation model constructed based on rules that can handle uncertainties in the operation of lithium-ion batteries. However, lithium-ion batteries may be affected by disturbances from internal or external sources during operation, which may affect the evaluation results. To prevent this problem, this paper proposes a disturbance-considering BRB modeling approach that considers the possible effects of disturbances on the battery in the operating environment and quantifies the disturbance-considering capability of the assessment model in combination with expert knowledge. Second, robustness and interpretability constraints are added in this paper, and an improved optimization algorithm is constructed that maintains or possibly improves the resistance of the model to disturbance. Finally, using the lithium-ion batteries provided by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Prediction Centre of Excellence and the University of Maryland as a case study, this paper verifies that the proposed modeling approach is capable of constructing robust models and demonstrates the effectiveness of the improved optimization algorithm.},

ABSTRACT = {Lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries, despite their prevalence, face issues of resource scarcity and environmental concerns, prompting the search for alternative technologies. This study addresses the need to assess and identify viable metal-ion battery alternatives to Li-ion batteries, focusing on the rapidly industrializing context of Vietnam. It acknowledges the criticality of developing a sustainable, cost-effective, and resource-efficient energy storage solution that aligns with the country’s growth trajectory. The primary objective is to evaluate the suitability of emerging metal-ion batteries—specifically sodium-ion (SIB), sodium-ion saltwater (SIB-S), magnesium-ion (MIB), and zinc-ion (ZIB)—for Vietnam’s energy storage needs, guiding future investment and policy decisions. A Fuzzy Multiple-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) approach is employed, incorporating both quantitative and qualitative criteria. This study utilizes the Fuzzy Best-Worst Method (BWM) to determine the relative importance of various performance indicators and then applies the Bonferroni Fuzzy Combined Compromise Solution (Bonferroni FCoCoSo) method to rank the battery alternatives. The SIBs emerged as the most promising alternative, scoring the highest in the overall evaluation. The MIBs and SIB-saltwater batteries displayed competitive potential, while the ZIBs ranked the lowest among the considered options. This research provides a strategic framework for energy policy formulation and investment prioritization. It contributes to the field by applying a fuzzy-based MCDM approach in a novel context and offers a structured comparative analysis of metal-ion batteries, enhancing the body of knowledge on sustainable energy storage technologies.},

ABSTRACT = {In the context of the electrification of the mobility sector, smart algorithms have to be developed to control battery packs. Smart and reconfigurable batteries are a promising alternative to conventional battery packs and offer new possibilities for operation and condition monitoring. This work proposes a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm to balance the State of Charge (SoC) of reconfigurable batteries based on the topologies half-bridge and battery modular multilevel management (BM3). As an RL algorithm, Amortized Q-learning (AQL) is implemented, which enables the control of enormous numbers of possible configurations of the reconfigurable battery as well as the combination of classical controlling approaches and machine learning methods. This enhances the safety mechanisms during control. As a neural network of the AQL, a Feedforward Neuronal Network (FNN) is implemented consisting of three hidden layers. The experimental evaluation using a 12-cell hybrid cascaded multilevel converter illustrates the applicability of the method to balance the SoC and maintain the balanced state during discharge. The evaluation shows a 20.3% slower balancing process compared to a conventional approach. Nevertheless, AQL shows great potential for multiobjective optimizations and can be applied as an RL algorithm for control in power electronics.},

ABSTRACT = {For all-solid-state batteries, the particle size distribution of the solid electrolyte is a critical factor. Small particles are preferred to obtain a high active mass loading of cathode active material and a small porosity in composite cathodes. In this work, the influence of the solid fraction in the wet-chemical synthesis of β-Li3PS4 in tetrahydrofuran (THF) is investigated. The solid fraction is varied between 50 and 200 mg/mL, and the obtained samples are evaluated using X-ray diffraction, SEM and electrochemical impedance measurements. The sizes of the resulting particles show a significant dependency on the solid fraction, while a good ionic conductivity is maintained. For the highest concentration, the particle sizes do not exceed 10 µm, but for the lowest concentration, particles up to ~73 µm can be found. The ionic conductivities at room temperature are determined to be 0.63 ± 0.01 × 10−4 S/cm and 0.78 ± 0.01 × 10−4 S/cm for the highest and lowest concentrations, respectively. These findings lead to an improvement towards the production of tailored sulfide solid electrolytes.},

ABSTRACT = {Most investigations on flow batteries (FBs) make the assumption of perfectly mixed electrolytes inside the tanks without estimating their likelihood, while specific analyses are missing in the literature. This paper presents a pioneering investigation of the electrolyte flow dynamics inside FB tanks. This study considers the Open Circuit Voltage (OCV) measured at the stack of a 9 kW/27 kWh Vanadium FB with 500 L tanks. Order-of-magnitude estimates of the measured dynamics suggest that differences in densities and viscosities of the active species drive gradients of concentrations with different patterns in the positive and negative tanks and in charge and discharge, affected by current and flow rate, which result in significant deviation from homogeneity, affecting the State of Charge (SoC) of the electrolytes flowed into the stack and thus the FB performance. In particular, stratifications of the inlet electrolytes may appear which are responsible for delays in reaching the outlets, with initial plateau and following step (s) in the SoC at the stack. These events can have a major impact in the performance of industrial FBs with large tanks and suggest that specific tank designs may improve the overall dynamics, calling for further analysis.},

ABSTRACT = {GeFe2O4 (GFO) is a germanium mineral whose spinel crystal structure determines its interesting functional properties. Recently, it was proposed for application as an anode for Sodium and Lithium-Ion Batteries (SIBs and LIBs) thanks to its combined conversion and alloying electrochemical mechanism. However, its entire potential is limited by the poor electronic conductivity and volumetric expansion during cycling. In the present paper, pure and Sn or Mg doped GFO samples obtained from mechano-chemical solid-state synthesis and properly carbon coated were structurally and electrochemically characterized and proposed, for the first time, as anodes for SIBs. The spinel cubic structure of pure GFO is maintained in doped samples. The expected redox processes, involving Fe and Ge ions, are evidenced in the electrochemical tests. The Sn doping demonstrated a beneficial effect on the long-term cycling (providing 150 mAh/g at 0.2 C after 120 cycles) and on the capacity values (346 mAh/g at 0.2 C with respect to 300 mAh/g of the pure one), while the Mg substitution was less effective.},

ABSTRACT = {Battery design efforts often prioritize enhancing the energy density of the active materials and their utilization. However, optimizing thermal management systems at both the cell and pack levels is also key to achieving mission-relevant battery design. Battery thermal management systems, responsible for managing the thermal profile of battery cells, are crucial for balancing the trade-offs between battery performance and lifetime. Designing such systems requires accounting for the multitude of heat sources within battery cells and packs. This paper provides a summary of heat generation characterizations observed in several commercial Li-ion battery cells using isothermal battery calorimetry. The primary focus is on assessing the impact of temperatures, C-rates, and formation cycles. Moreover, a module-level characterization demonstrated the significant additional heat generated by module interconnects. Characterizing heat signatures at each level helps inform manufacturing at the design, production, and characterization phases that might otherwise go unaccounted for at the full pack level. Further testing of a 5 kWh battery pack revealed that a considerable temperature non-uniformity may arise due to inefficient cooling arrangements. To mitigate this type of challenge, a combined thermal characterization and multi-domain modeling approach is proposed, offering a solution without the need for constructing a costly module prototype.},

ABSTRACT = {Second-life applications for lithium-ion batteries offer the industry opportunities to defer recycling costs, enhance economic value, and reduce environmental impacts. An accurate prognosis of the remaining useful life (RUL) is essential for ensuring effective second-life operation. Diagnosis is a necessary step for the establishment of a reliable prognosis, based on the aging modes involved in a cell. This paper introduces a method for characterizing specific aging phenomenon in Graphite/Lithium Iron Phosphate (G/LFP) cells. This method aims to identify aging related to the loss of active material at the negative electrode (LAMNE). The identification and tracking of the state of health (SoH) are based on Incremental Capacity Analysis (ICA) and Differential Voltage Analysis (DVA) peak-tracking techniques. The remaining capacity of the electrode is thus evaluated based on these diagnostic results, using a model derived from half-cell electrode characterization. The method is used on a G/LFP cell in the format 18650, with a nominal capacity of 1.1 Ah, aged from its pristine state to 40% of state of health.},

ABSTRACT = {Accurate estimation of lithium-ion battery state of health (SOH) can effectively improve the operational safety of electric vehicles and optimize the battery operation strategy. However, previous SOH estimation algorithms developed based on high-precision laboratory data have ignored the discrepancies between field and laboratory data, leading to difficulties in field application. Therefore, aiming to bridge the gap between the lab-developed models and the field operational data, this paper presents a feature engineering-based SOH estimation method with downgraded laboratory battery data, applicable to real vehicles under different operating conditions. Firstly, a data processing pipeline is proposed to downgrade laboratory data to operational fleet-level data. The six key features are extracted on the partial ranges to capture the battery’s aging state. Finally, three machine learning (ML) algorithms for easy online deployment are employed for SOH assessment. The results show that the hybrid feature set performs well and has high accuracy in SOH estimation for downgraded data, with a minimum root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.36%. Only three mechanism features derived from the incremental capacity curve can still provide a proper assessment, with a minimum RMSE of 0.44%. Voltage-based features can assist in evaluating battery state, improving accuracy by up to 20%.},

ABSTRACT = {Energy management in the residential sector contributes to energy system dispatching and security with the optimal use of renewable energy systems (RES) and energy storage systems (ESSs) and by utilizing the main grid based on its state. This work focuses on optimal energy flow, ESS parameters, and energy consumption scheduling based on demand response (DR) programs. The primary goals of the work consist of minimizing electricity costs while simultaneously extending the lifetime of ESSs in conjunction with extracting maximum benefits throughout their operational lifespan and reducing CO2 emissions. Effective ESS and photovoltaic (PV) energy usage prices are modeled and an efficient energy flow management algorithm is presented, which considers the life cycle of the ESSs including batteries, electrical vehicles (EVs) and the efficient use of the PV system while reducing the cost of energy consumption. In addition, an optimization technique is employed to obtain the optimal ESS parameters including the size and depth of discharge (DOD), considering the installation cost, levelized cost of storage (LCOS), winter and summer conditions, energy consumption profile, and energy prices. Finally, an optimization technique is applied to obtain the optimal energy consumption scheduling. The proposed system provides all of the possibilities of exchanging energy between EV, battery, PV system, grid, and home. The optimization problem is solved using the particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) in MATLAB with an interval time of one minute. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed system, presenting an actual cost reduction of 28.9% and 17.7% in summer and winter, respectively, compared to a base scenario. Similarly, the energy losses were reduced by 26.7% in winter and 22.3% in summer, and the EV battery lifetime was extended from 9.2 to 19.1 years in the winter scenario and from 10.4 to 17.7 years in the summer scenario. The integrated system provided a financial contribution during the operational lifetime of EUR 11,600 and 7900 in winter and summer scenarios, respectively. The CO2 was reduced by 59.7% and 46.2% in summer and winter scenarios, respectively.},

ABSTRACT = {The propagation of thermal runaway in a battery system is safety-critical in almost every application, such as electric vehicles or home storage. Abuse models can help to undestand propagation mechanisms and assist in designing safe battery systems, but need to be well-parametrized. Most of the heat during thermal runaway is released by venting that is why the characteristic of the vent flow plays an important part in the safety assessment. During venting, the cell generates a recoil force like a rocket, which depends on the flow speed and flow rate of the gas. This principle is used in this work to measure the velocity and mass flow rate of the vent gas. High-power and high-energy 18650 format lithium-ion batteries were overheated and the recoil and weight forces were measured to determine the venting parameter during thermal runaway. Our results show, that the linearized gas flow rate for the high-power and high-energy cell is 22.15gs−1 and 27.92gs−1, respectively. The progress of the gas velocity differs between the two cell types and in case of the high-energy cell, it follows a single peak asymmetrical pattern with a peak of 398.5ms−1, while the high-power cell shows a bumpy pattern with a maximum gas velocity of 260.9ms−1. The developed test bench and gained results can contribute insights in the venting behavior, characterize venting, support safety assessments, simulations and pack design studies.},

ABSTRACT = {In large-capacity energy storage systems, instructions are decomposed typically using an equalized power distribution strategy, where clusters/modules operate at the same power and durations. When dispatching shifts from stable single conditions to intricate coupled conditions, this distribution strategy inevitably results in increased inconsistency and hastened system aging. This paper presents a novel differentiated power distribution strategy comprising three control variables: the rotation status, and the operating boundaries for both depth of discharge (DOD) and C-rates (C) within a control period. The proposed strategy integrates an aging cost prediction model developed to express the mapping relationship between these control variables and aging costs. Additionally, it incorporates the multi-colony particle swarm optimization (Mc-PSO) algorithm into the optimization model to minimize aging costs. The aging cost prediction model consists of three functions: predicting health features (HFs) based on the cumulative charge/discharge throughput quantity and operating boundaries, characterizing HFs as comprehensive scores, and calculating aging costs using both comprehensive scores and residual equipment value. Further, we elaborated on the engineering application process for the proposed control strategy. In the simulation scenarios, this strategy prolonged the service life by 14.62%, reduced the overall aging cost by 6.61%, and improved module consistency by 21.98%, compared with the traditional equalized distribution strategy. In summary, the proposed strategy proves effective in elongating service life, reducing overall aging costs, and increasing the benefit of energy storage systems in particular application scenarios.},

ABSTRACT = {Screw design in the extrusion process has an important effect on the distribution of material through the extruder, resulting in partially filled sections in the processing zone. Accordingly, the local accumulation of material in the extruder leads to variations in material strain conditions and also influences the local residence time of the material in a given screw section. This work evaluates particle dispersion in anode slurry considering three different screw arrangements. The particle size distribution is considered as a quality parameter representing the microstructure of the battery slurry components and their distribution. Numerical simulation of the material flow behavior through a laboratory extruder was performed to investigate the filling ratios and resulting shear rates for different screw designs and process conditions. The importance of process parameters and a suitable screw configuration to achieve specific particle sizes in battery slurry is discussed.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper showcases the integration of the Interfacing Toolbox for Robotic Arms (ITRA) with our newly developed hybrid Visual Servoing (VS) methods to automate the disassembly of electric vehicle batteries, thereby advancing sustainability and fostering a circular economy. ITRA enhances collaboration between industrial robotic arms, server computers, sensors, and actuators, meeting the intricate demands of robotic disassembly, including the essential real-time tracking of components and robotic arms. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our hybrid VS approach, combined with ITRA, in the context of Electric Vehicle (EV) battery disassembly across two robotic testbeds. The first employs a KUKA KR10 robot for precision tasks, while the second utilizes a KUKA KR500 for operations needing higher payload capacity. Conducted in T1 (Manual Reduced Velocity) mode, our experiments underscore a swift communication protocol that links low-level and high-level control systems, thus enabling rapid object detection and tracking. This allows for the efficient completion of disassembly tasks, such as removing the EV battery’s top case in 27 s and disassembling a stack of modules in 32 s. The demonstrated success of our framework highlights its extensive applicability in robotic manufacturing sectors that demand precision and adaptability, including medical robotics, extreme environments, aerospace, and construction.},

ABSTRACT = {Thermal events in lead-acid batteries during their operation play an important role; they affect not only the reaction rate of ongoing electrochemical reactions, but also the rate of discharge and self-discharge, length of service life and, in critical cases, can even cause a fatal failure of the battery, known as “thermal runaway.” This contribution discusses the parameters affecting the thermal state of the lead-acid battery. It was found by calculations and measurements that there is a cooling component in the lead-acid battery system which is caused by the endothermic discharge reactions and electrolysis of water during charging, related to entropy change contribution. Thus, under certain circumstances, it is possible to lower the temperature of the lead-acid battery during its discharging. The Joule heat generated on the internal resistance of the cell due to current flow, the exothermic charging reaction, and above all, the gradual increase in polarization as the cell voltage increases during charging all contribute to the heating of the cell, overtaking the cooling effect. Of these three sources of thermal energy, Joule heating in polarization resistance contributes the most to the temperature rise in the lead-acid battery. Thus, the maximum voltage reached determines the slope of the temperature rise in the lead-acid battery cell, and by a suitably chosen limiting voltage, it is possible to limit the danger of the “thermal runaway” effect. The overall thermal conditions of the experimental cell are significantly affected by the ambient temperature of the external environment and the rate of heat transfer through the walls of the calorimeter. A series of experiments with direct temperature measurement of individual locations within a lead-acid battery uses a calorimeter made of expanded polystyrene to minimize external influences. A hitherto unpublished phenomenon is discussed whereby the temperature of the positive electrode was lower than that of the negative electrode throughout the discharge, while during charging, the order was reversed and the temperature of the positive electrode was higher than that of the negative electrode throughout the charge. The authors relate this phenomenon to the higher reaction entropy change of the active mass of the positive electrode than that of the negative electrode.},

ABSTRACT = {SiO2 has a much higher theoretical specific capacity (1965 mAh g−1) than graphite, making it a promising anode material for lithium-ion batteries, but its low conductivity and volume expansion problems need to be improved urgently. In this work, pompon mum-like SiO2/C nanospheres with the sandwich and porous nanostructure were obtained by using dendritic fibrous nano silica (DFNS) and glucose as matrix and carbon source, respectively, through hydrothermal, carbonization and etching operations. The influence of SiO2 content and porous structure on its electrochemical performance was discussed in detail. The final results showed that the C/DFNS-6 with a SiO2 content of 6 wt% exhibits the best electrochemical performance as a negative electrode material for lithium-ion batteries due to its optimal specific surface area, porosity, and appropriate SiO2 content. C/DFNS-6 displays a high specific reversible capacity of 986 mAh g−1 at 0.2 A g−1 after 200 cycles, and 529 mAh g−1 at a high current density (1.0 A g−1) after 300 cycles. It also has excellent rate capability, with a reversible capacity that rises from 599 mAh g−1 to 1066 mAh g−1 when the current density drops from 4.0 A g−1 to 0.2 A g−1. These SiO2/C specific pompon mum-like nanospheres with excellent electrochemical performance have great research significance in the field of lithium-ion batteries.},

ABSTRACT = {The work presents the research results regarding the development of an innovative technology for the production of lithium perrhenate. The new technology is based entirely on hydrometallurgical processes. The source of lithium was solutions created during the processing of Li-ion battery masses, and the source of rhenium was perrhenic acid, produced from the scraps of Ni-based superalloys. The research showed that with the use of lithium carbonate, obtained from post-leaching solutions of Li-ion battery waste and properly purified (by washing with water, alcohol, and cyclic purification with CO2), and perrhenic acid, lithium perrhenate can be obtained. The following conditions: room temperature, time 1 h, 30% excess of lithium carbonate, and rhenium concentration in the acid from 20 g/dm3 to 300 g/dm3, allowed to produce a compound containing a total of 1000 ppm of metal impurities. The developed technology is characterized by the management of all aqueous waste solutions and solid waste and the lack of loss of valuable metals such as rhenium and lithium after the initial precipitation step of lithium carbonate.},

ABSTRACT = {Lithium-ion batteries are currently widely employed in a variety of applications. Precise estimation of the remaining useful life (RUL) of lithium-ion batteries holds significant function in intelligent battery management systems (BMS). Therefore, in order to increase the fidelity and stabilization of predicting the RUL of lithium-ion batteries, in this paper, an innovative strategy for RUL prediction is proposed by integrating a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D CNN) and a bilayer long short-term memory (BLSTM) neural network. Feature extraction is carried out through the input capacity data of the model using 1D CNN, and these deep features are used as the input of the BLSTM. The memory function of the BLSTM is applied to retain key information in the database and to better understand the coupling relationship among consecutive time series data along the time axis, thereby effectively predicting the RUL trends of lithium-ion batteries. Two different types of lithium-ion battery datasets from NASA and CALCE were used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results show that the proposed method achieves higher prediction accuracy, demonstrates stronger generalization capabilities, and effectively reduces prediction errors compared to other methods.},

ABSTRACT = {End-of-life electric vehicle (EV) batteries can be reused to reduce their environmental impact and economic costs. However, the growth of the second-life market is limited by the lack of information on the characteristics and performance of these batteries. As the volume of end-of-life EVs may exceed the amount of batteries needed for stationary applications, investigating the possibility of repurposing them in mobile applications is also necessary. This article presents an experimental test that can be used to collect the data necessary to fill a battery passport. The proposed procedure can facilitate the decision-making process regarding the suitability of a battery for reuse at the end of its first life. Once the battery passport has been completed, the performance and characteristics of the battery are compared with the requirements of several mobile applications. Mobile charging stations and forklift trucks were identified as relevant applications for the reuse of high-capacity prismatic cells. Finally, a definition of the state of health (SoH) is proposed to track the suitability of the battery during use in the second-life application considering not only the energy but also the power and efficiency of the battery. This SoH shows that even taking into account accelerated ageing data, a repurposed battery can have an extended life of 11 years at 25 °C. It has also been shown that energy fade is the most limiting performance factor for the lifetime and that cell-to-cell variation should be tracked as it has been shown to have a significant impact on the battery life.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper develops a model for lithium-ion batteries under dynamic stress testing (DST) and federal urban driving schedule (FUDS) conditions that incorporates associated hysteresis characteristics of 18650-format lithium iron-phosphate batteries. Additionally, it introduces the adaptive sliding mode observer algorithm (ASMO) to achieve robust and swiftly accurate estimation of the state of charge (SOC) of lithium-iron-phosphate batteries during electric vehicle duty cycles. The established simplified hysteresis model in this paper significantly enhances the fitting accuracy during charging and discharging processes, compensating for voltage deviations induced by hysteresis characteristics. The SOC estimation, even in the face of model parameter changes under complex working conditions during electric vehicle duty cycles, maintains high robustness by capitalizing on the easy convergence and parameter insensitivity of ASMO. Lastly, experiments conducted under different temperatures and FUDS and DST conditions validate that the SOC estimation of lithium-iron-phosphate batteries, based on the adaptive sliding-mode observer and the simplified hysteresis model, exhibits enhanced robustness and faster convergence under complex working conditions and temperature variations during electric vehicle duty cycles.},

ABSTRACT = {We introduce a quasi-solid-state electrolyte lithium-sulfur (Li–S) battery (QSSEB) based on a novel Li-argyrodite solid-state electrolyte (SSE), Super P–Sulfur cathode, and Li-anode. The cathode was prepared using a water-based carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) solution and styrene butadiene rubber (SBR) as the binder while Li6PS5F0.5Cl0.5 SSE was synthesized using a solvent-based process, via the introduction of LiF into the argyrodite crystal structure, which enhances both the ionic conductivity and interface-stabilizing properties of the SSE. Ionic liquids (IL) were prepared using lithium bis(trifluoromethyl sulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) as the salt, with pre-mixed pyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethyl sulfonyl)imide (PYR) as solvent and 1,3-dioxolane (DOL) as diluent, and they were used to wet the SSE–electrode interfaces. The effect of IL dilution, the co-solvent amount, the LiTFSI concentration, the C rate at which the batteries are tested and the effect of the introduction of SSE in the cathode, were systematically studied and optimized to develop a QSSEB with higher capacity retention and cyclability. Interfacial reactions occurring at the cathode–SSE interface during cycling were also investigated using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy supported by ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. This work offers a new insight into the intimate interfacial contacts between the SSE and carbon–sulfur cathodes, which are critical for improving the electrochemical performance of quasi-solid-state lithium–sulfur batteries.},

ABSTRACT = {Considering the diversity of battery data under dynamic test conditions, the stability of battery working data is affected due to the diversity of charge and discharge rates, variability of operating temperature, and randomness of the current state of charge, and the data types are multi-sourced, which increases the difficulty of estimating battery SOH based on data-driven methods. In this paper, a lithium-ion battery state of health estimation method with sample transfer learning under dynamic test conditions is proposed. Through the Tradaboost.R2 method, the weight of the source domain sample data is adjusted to complete the update of the sample data distribution. At the same time, considering the division methods of the six auxiliary and the source domain data set, aging features from different state of charge ranges are selected. It is verified that while the aging feature dimension and the demand for target domain label data are reduced, the estimation accuracy of the lithium-ion battery state of health is not affected by the initial value of the state of charge. By considering the mean absolute error, mean square error and root mean square error, the estimated error results do not exceed 1.2% on the experiment battery data, which highlights the advantages of the proposed methods.},

ABSTRACT = {The global environmental crisis necessitates reliable, sustainable, and safe energy storage solutions. The current systems are nearing their capacity limits due to the reliance on conventional liquid electrolytes, which are fraught with stability and safety concerns, prompting the exploration of solid-state electrolytes, which enable the integration of metal electrodes. Solid-state sodium-ion batteries emerge as an appealing option by leveraging the abundance, low cost, and sustainability of sodium. However, low ionic conductivity and high interfacial resistance currently prevent their widespread adoption. This study explores polyvinyl-based polymers as wetting agents for the NASICON-type NZSP (Na3Zr2Si2PO12) solid electrolyte, resulting in a combined system with enhanced ionic conductivity suitable for Na-ion solid-state full cells. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) performed on symmetric cells employing NZSP paired with different wetting agent compositions demonstrates a significant reduction in interfacial resistance with the use of poly(vinyl acetate)—(PVAc-) based polymers, achieving an impressive ionic conductivity of 1.31 mS cm−1 at room temperature, 63.8% higher than the pristine material, notably reaching 7.36 mS cm−1 at 90 °C. These results offer valuable insights into the potential of PVAc-based polymers for advancing high-performance solid-state sodium-ion batteries by reducing their total internal resistance.},

ABSTRACT = {Road transportation is a significant worldwide contributor to greenhouse gases, and electrifying the driveline of road vehicles is essential in overcoming the evident challenge of climate change. A sustainable transition to electric vehicles requires efficient and safe methods for recycling and repurposing used electric vehicle batteries. While various testing methods have been explored for assessing battery state of health and state of risk for recycling and reuse, a research gap exists concerning using data from integrated battery monitoring systems in the recycling process of electric vehicle batteries. This study addresses the research gap by presenting an approach to extract data from the monitoring system integrated into the battery using the automotive standard controller area network interface. In addition, methods to use this interface to ensure the optimal state of charge of the batteries for storage are presented. The benefits, challenges, and limitations set by the proprietary nature of the data to assess the state of risk and health of electric vehicle batteries for recycling and repurposing are presented, discussed, and evaluated. Finally, the influence of battery regulations and the battery passport proposal on electric vehicle battery recycling and repurposing are discussed to provide future perspectives.},

This work investigated a new approach towards the simulation of blended electrodes by replicating the complex current distributions within the electrodes using a paralleling model rather than the traditional constant-current method. In addition, a blending model was used to generate three publicly available datasets with more than 260,000 unique degradations for three exemplary blended cells. These datasets allowed us to showcase the necessity of considering all active components of the blend separately for diagnosis and prognosis.},

ABSTRACT = {The most common pattern types for anode structuring, in particular the line, grid, and hexagonal-arranged hole pattern were evaluated in a comparable setup in full-cells and symmetrical cells. The cells with structured electrodes were compared to reference cells with unstructured anodes of similar areal capacity (4.3 mAh cm−2) and the onset of lithium plating during fast-charging was determined in situ by differential voltage analysis of the voltage relaxation and ex situ by post-mortem analysis. Furthermore, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements on symmetrical cells were used to determine the ionic resistance of structured and unstructured electrodes of similar areal capacity. All cells with structured electrodes showed lower ionic resistances and an onset of lithium plating shifted to higher C-rates compared to cells with unstructured electrodes. The structure patterns with capillary structures, i.e., lines and grids, showed significant reduced lithium plating during fast-charging and a higher rate capability compared to reference cells with unstructured electrodes and cells with hole structured electrodes. The continuous rewetting of the electrode with liquid electrolyte by capillary forces and the reduced ionic resistance of the 3D electrode are identified as key factors in improving overall battery performance. The data of the studied cells were used to calculate the resulting energy and power densities of prospective commercial pouch cells and potential pitfalls in the comparison to cells with unstructured electrodes were identified.},

By examining these mechanisms, insights are provided into the dynamics of the second-life battery market, facilitating the development of strategies to optimize resource utilization and sustainability in the EV industry.

ABSTRACT = {The present article introduces a strategy for controlling oxidation and reduction reactions within polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) networks as a means of enhancing storage capacity through the complexation of dissociated lithium cations with multifunctional groups of the polymer network. Specifically, co-polymer networks based on polysulfide (PS) and polyoxide (PO) precursors, photo-cured in the presence of succinonitrile (SCN) and lithium bis(trifluoro methane sulfonyl imide) (LiTFSI) salt, exhibited ionic conductivity on the order of mid 10−4 S/cm at ambient temperature in the 30/35/35 (weight %) composition. Lithium titanate (LTO, Li4Ti5O12) electrode was chosen as an anode (i.e., a potential source of Li ions) against lithium iron phosphate (LFP, LiFePO4) cathode in conjunction with polysulfide-co-polyoxide dual polyelectrolyte networks to control viscosity for 3D printability on conformal surfaces of drone and aeronautic vehicles. It was found that the PS-co-PO dual network-based polymer electrolyte containing SCN plasticizer and LiTFSI salt exhibited extra storage capacity (i.e., specific capacity of 44 mAh/g) with the overall specific capacity of 170 mAh/g (i.e., for the combined LTO electrode and PEM) initially that stabilized at 153 mAh/g after 50th cycles with a reasonable capacity retention of over 90% and Coulombic efficiency of over 99%. Of particular interest is the observation of the improved electrochemical performance of the polysulfide-co-polyoxide electrolyte dual-network relative to that of the polyoxide electrolyte single-network.},

ABSTRACT = {The state of health is a crucial state that suggests the capacity of lithium-ion batteries to store and restitute energy at a certain power level, which should be carefully monitored in the battery management system. However, the state of health of batteries is unmeasurable and, currently, it is usually estimated within a specific area of the whole charging data, which is very limited in practical application because of the incomplete and random charging behaviors of users. In this paper, we intend to estimate the state of health of batteries with flexible partial charging curves and normal multi-layer perceptron based on the degradation data of eight 0.74 Ah batteries. To make the estimation more adaptive and flexible, we extract several features from partial charging curves. Analysis of the relationship between extracted features and the state of health shows that the extracted features are useful in estimation. As the length of the partial charging curve increases, the extracted features still function well, and the root mean square error of the test set is lower than 1.5%. Further validation on the other two types of batteries reveals that the proposed method achieves high accuracy even with different sampling and working conditions. The proposed method offers an easy-to-implement way to achieve an accurate estimation of a battery’s state of health.},

ABSTRACT = {The potential of metallic lithium to become the anode material for next-generation batteries is hampered by significant challenges, chief among which is dendrite growth during battery charging. These dendritic structures not only impair battery performance but also pose safety risks. Among the non-destructive analytical techniques in battery research, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) stands out as a promising tool. However, the direct imaging of lithium by 7Li MRI is limited by its low sensitivity and spatial resolution, making it a less effective way of imaging dendrite growth. Instead, a recently introduced indirect imaging approach which is based on 1H MRI of the electrolyte was used in this study. This method was used to sequentially 3D image and thus monitor the charging process of lithium metal symmetric cells in three different electrical circuits, namely those composed of a single cell, four cells in parallel, and four cells in series. The measured sequential images allowed for the measurement of dendrite growth in each cell using volumetric analysis. The growth results confirmed the theoretical prediction that the growth across cells is uneven in a parallel circuit, and even in a series circuit. The methods presented in this study can also be applied to analyze many other dendrite-related issues in batteries.},

ABSTRACT = {Metallic zinc (Zn) presents a compelling alternative to conventional electrochemical energy storage systems due to its environmentally friendly nature, abundant availability, high water compatibility, low toxicity, low electrochemical potential (−0.762 V vs. SHE), and cost-effectiveness. While considerable efforts have been devoted to enhancing the physical and chemical properties of zinc-ion battery materials to improve battery efficiency and longevity, research on multi-physics coupled modeling for a deeper understanding of battery performance remains relatively scarce. In this study, we established a comprehensive two-dimensional model for single-flow zinc–nickel redox batteries to investigate electrode reactions, current-potential behaviors, and concentration distributions, leveraging theories such as Nernst–Planck and Butler–Volmer. Additionally, we explored the distribution of the velocity field using the Brinkman theory in porous media and the Navier–Stokes equations in free-flow channels. The validated model, informed by experimental data, not only provides insights into the performance of the battery, but also offers valuable recommendations for advancing single-flow zinc–nickel battery technology. Our findings offer promising avenues for enhancing the design and performance of not only zinc–nickel flow batteries, but also applicable for other flow battery designs.},

ABSTRACT = {Modern research has made the search for high-performance, sustainable, and efficient energy storage technologies a main focus, especially in light of the growing environmental and energy-demanding issues. This review paper focuses on the pivotal role of biomass-derived carbon (BDC) materials in the development of high-performance metal-ion hybrid supercapacitors (MIHSCs), specifically targeting sodium (Na)-, potassium (K)-, aluminium (Al)-, and zinc (Zn)-ion-based systems. Due to their widespread availability, renewable nature, and exceptional physicochemical properties, BDC materials are ideal for supercapacitor electrodes, which perfectly balance environmental sustainability and technological advancement. This paper delves into the synthesis, functionalization, and structural engineering of advanced biomass-based carbon materials, highlighting the strategies to enhance their electrochemical performance. It elaborates on the unique characteristics of these carbons, such as high specific surface area, tuneable porosity, and heteroatom doping, which are pivotal in achieving superior capacitance, energy density, and cycling stability in Na-, K-, Al-, and Zn-ion hybrid supercapacitors. Furthermore, the compatibility of BDCs with metal-ion electrolytes and their role in facilitating ion transport and charge storage mechanisms are critically analysed. Novelty arises from a comprehensive comparison of these carbon materials across metal-ion systems, unveiling the synergistic effects of BDCs’ structural attributes on the performance of each supercapacitor type. This review also casts light on the current challenges, such as scalability, cost-effectiveness, and performance consistency, offering insightful perspectives for future research. This review underscores the transformative potential of BDC materials in MIHSCs and paves the way for next-generation energy storage technologies that are both high-performing and ecologically friendly. It calls for continued innovation and interdisciplinary collaboration to explore these sustainable materials, thereby contributing to advancing green energy technologies.},

ABSTRACT = {Li–S batteries are positioned as a strong alternative for efficient energy storage due to their high theoretical energy density and their theoretical specific capacity (1675 mA h g−1) compared to current Li-ion batteries; however, their commercialization is affected by the rapid decay of the specific capacity as a consequence of the different species of lithium polysulfides that are generated during the charge–discharge processes. The use of nitrogen-doped mesoporous carbon materials has been shown to have the ability to confer electronic conductivity to sulfur and retain the lithium polysulfide species. However, there are not enough studies to help understand how the type of nitrogen precursor influences the development of specific nitrogen functionalities to favor the retention of lithium polysulfide species. This work seeks to determine the effect of the use of different nitrogen precursors on the structural changes of the mesoporous carbon materials prepared, and thus evaluate the electrochemical behavior of Li–S cells correlating the type of nitrogen functionality generated when the precursor is variated with the charge/discharge capacity developed during the cell operation. For this study, different carbon materials were prepared by the variation of the nitrogen source (melamine, ethylenediamine, and hexadecylamine) to obtain a N-doped mesoporous carbon with different distributions of nitrogen functionalities in its structure. The use of the primary amine ethylenediamine as a nitrogen precursor in the formation of structured carbon materials favored elemental sulfur infiltration into its pores, resulting in the maximum sulfur content within the pores and interacting with the carbonaceous matrix (78.8 wt.%). The carbon material prepared with this precursor resulted in a higher content of N-pyridinic functionality, which, combined with the high content of N-pyrrolic, resulted in the highest specific discharge capacity at 0.1 C after 100 cycles when compared to cells assembled with materials derived from the use of melamine and hexadecylamine precursors. The cell assembled with the electrode formed from ethylenediamine as a nitrogen precursor presented an initial discharge capacity of 918 mA h g−1 with a Coulombic efficiency of ~83.4% at 0.1 C after 100 cycles.},

ABSTRACT = {Extensive use of Li-ion batteries in electric vehicles, electronics, and other energy storage applications has resulted in a need to recycle valuable metals Li, Mn, Ni, and Co in these devices. In this work, an aqueous mixture of glycolic and lactic acid is shown as an excellent leaching agent to recover these critical metals from spent Li-ion laptop batteries combined with cathode and anode coatings without adding hydrogen peroxide or other reducing agents. An aqueous acid mixture of 0.15 M in glycolic and 0.35 M in lactic acid showed the highest leaching efficiencies of 100, 100, 100, and 89% for Li, Ni, Mn, and Co, respectively, in an experiment at 120 °C for 6 h. Subsequently, the chelate solution was evaporated to give a mixed metal-hydroxy acid chelate gel. Pyrolysis of the dried chelate gel at 800 °C for 15 h could be used to burn off hydroxy acids, regenerating lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide, and the novel method presented to avoid the precipitation of metals as hydroxide or carbonates. The Li, Ni, Mn, and Co ratio of regenerated lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide is comparable to this metal ratio in pyrolyzed electrode coating and showed similar powder X-ray diffractograms, suggesting the suitability of α-hydroxy carboxylic acid mixtures as leaching agents and ligands in regeneration of mixed metal oxide via pyrolysis of the dried chelate gel.},

To ensure their safe and efficient usage, battery management systems (BMSs) are often integrated into the battery systems.

This paper proposes a data-driven approach for the joint online estimation of SOC and SOH utilizing multi-task learning (MTL) approaches, particularly highlighting cross-stitch units and cross-stitch networks. The proposed model is able to achieve an accurate estimation of SOC and SOH in online applications with optimized information sharing and multi-scale implementation. Comprehensive results on training and testing of the model are presented. Possible improvements for future work are also discussed in the paper.},

ABSTRACT = {Given the relevance of lithium and post-lithium batteries as electrochemical energy storage systems, the peculiar crystalline structure of V2O5 and its doping capacity play key roles in lithium-ion battery technology. To integrate them in high-efficiency modules, systematic methodologies are required to estimate the state of charge in a reliable way and predict the Li-V2O5 battery’s performance according to their electrochemical phenomena, including two plateaus in the galvanostatic cycling curves and the dynamic behavior governed by the energy demand. Most state of charge estimation and battery modeling procedures are focused on conventional Li-batteries that show a unique plateau. In this work, we propose a systematic methodology based on the galvanostatic intermittent titration technique and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy to study battery performance in the time and frequency domains, respectively. The proposed methodology, with a time–frequency correlation, promotes a deeper understanding of the electrochemical phenomena and general behavior of Li-V2O5 batteries, allowing for its subsequent extrapolation to more complex and higher-capacity lithium and post-lithium batteries used in high-power applications with a minimum error.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, a novel experimental setup to quantify the particle deposition during a lithium-ion battery thermal runaway (TR) is proposed. The setup integrates a single prismatic battery cell into an environment representing similar conditions as found for battery modules in battery packs of electric vehicles. In total, 86 weighing plates, positioned within the flow path of the vented gas and particles, can be individually removed from the setup in order to determine the spatial mass distribution of the deposited particles. Two proof-of-concept experiments with different distances between cell vent and module cover are performed. The particle deposition on the weighing plates as well as the particle size distribution of the deposited particles are found to be dependent on the distance between cell vent and cover. In addition, the specific heat capacity of the deposited particles as well as the jelly roll remains are analyzed. Its temperature dependency is found to be comparable for both ejected particles and jelly roll remains. The results of this study help researches and engineers to gain further insights into the particle ejection process during TR. By implementing certain suggested improvements, the proposed experimental setup may be used in the future to provide necessary data for simulation model validation. Therefore, this study contributes to the improvement of battery pack design and safety.},

ABSTRACT = {Vanadium redox flow batteries are promising energy storage devices and are already ahead of lead–acid batteries in terms of installed capacity in energy systems due to their long service life and possibility of recycling. One of the crucial tasks today is the development of models for assessing battery performance and its residual resource based on the battery’s present state. A promising method for estimating battery capacity is based on analyzing present voltage and current values under various load conditions. This paper analyzes the discharge characteristics of a 10 kW all-vanadium redox flow battery at fixed load powers from 6 to 12 kW. A linear dependence of operating voltage and initial discharge voltage on load power is established. It is also determined that the slope of the discharge curve linear section does not increase linearly in absolute value, and the Box–Lucas model can be used to describe it. Models for predicting current VRFB capacity based on different curve fitting functions are proposed. These models can be used to roughly estimate battery capacity at different load powers.},

ABSTRACT = {Aqueous zinc metal batteries (AZMBs) are considered a promising candidate for grid-scale energy storage systems owing to their high capacity, high safety and low cost. However, Zn anodes suffer from notorious dendrite growth and undesirable surface corrosion, severely hindering the commercialization of AZMBs. Herein, a strategy for engineering a dense ZnO coating layer on Zn anodes using the atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique is developed, aiming to improve its long-term cycling stability with fewer Zn dendrites. The surface-modified Zn anode (ZnO@Zn) exhibits an excellent long-cycling life (680 h) and stable coulombic efficiency when being used in a symmetric cell. Moreover, the ZnO@Zn electrode shows a high stability with almost no capacity decay after 1100 cycles at 2C in a full cell using MnO2 as the cathode. The ZnO coating is conducive to reducing corrosion and the generation of by-products, thus increasing the reversibility of Zn2+/Zn stripping/plating. Particularly, density functional theory (DFT) calculation results reveal that the ZnO coating layer could effectively lower the adsorption energy of the Zn(002) plane in ZnO@Zn, inducing the preferential deposition of Zn2+ towards the (002) crystal plane with fewer Zn dendrites. The surface ZnO coating protocol provides a promising approach to achieve a dendrite-free Zn anode for stable AZMBs.},

ABSTRACT = {With the rapid development of new energy vehicles and energy storage industries, the demand for lithium-ion batteries has surged, and the number of spent LIBs has also increased. Therefore, a new method for lithium selective extraction from spent lithium-ion battery cathode materials is proposed, aiming at more efficient recovery of valuable metals. The acid + oxidant leaching system was proposed for spent ternary positive electrode materials, which can achieve the selective and efficient extraction of lithium. In this study, 0.1 mol L−1 H2SO4 and 0.2 mol L−1 (NH4)2S2O8 were used as leaching acid and oxidant. The leaching efficiencies of Li, Ni, Co, and Mn were 98.7, 30, 3.5, and 0.1%, respectively. The lithium solution was obtained by adjusting the pH of the solution. Thermodynamic and kinetic studies of the lithium leaching process revealed that the apparent activation energy of the lithium leaching process is 46 kJ mol−1 and the rate step is the chemical reaction process. The leaching residue can be used as a ternary precursor to prepare regenerated positive electrode materials by solid-phase sintering. Electrochemical tests of the regenerated material proved that the material has good electrochemical properties. The highest discharge capacity exceeds 150 mAh g−1 at 0.2 C, and the capacity retention rate after 100 cycles exceeds 90%. The proposed new method can extract lithium from the ternary material with high selectivity and high efficiency, reducing its loss in the lengthy process. Lithium replenishment of the delithiation material can also restore its activity and realize the comprehensive utilization of elements such as nickel, cobalt, and manganese. The method combines the lithium recovery process and the material preparation process, simplifying the process and saving costs, thus providing new ideas for future method development.},

ABSTRACT = {Asymmetric lithium salts, such as lithium (difluoromethanesulfonyl)(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiDFTFSI), have been demonstrated to surpass traditional symmetric lithium salts with improved Li+ conductivity and the capacity to generate a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) while maintaining compatibility with an aluminum (Al0) current collector. However, the intrinsic reductive mechanism through which LiDFTFSI influences battery performance remains unclear and under debate. Herein, detailed SEI reactions of LiDFTFSI–based electrolytes were investigated by combining density functional theory and molecular dynamics, aiming to clarify the formation process and atomic structure of the SEI. Our results show that asymmetric DFTFSI− weakens the interaction between carbonate solvents and Li+, and substantially alters the solvation structure, exhibiting a well-balanced coordination capacity compared to bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (TFSI−). Nanosecond hybrid molecular dynamics simulation further reveals that preferential decomposition of LiDFTFSI produces sufficient LiF and Li2O to facilitate a robust SEI. Moreover, abundant F− generated from LiDFTFSI decomposition accumulates on the Al surface and subsequently combines with Al3+ from the current collector to form AlF3, potentially inhibiting corrosion of the current collector. Overall, these findings elucidate how LiDFTFSI regulates the solvation sheath and SEI structure, advancing the development of high-performance electrolytes compatible with current collectors.},
