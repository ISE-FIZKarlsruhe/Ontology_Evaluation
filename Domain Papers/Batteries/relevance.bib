ABSTRACT = {An automatic fast charger station with a power level of 120 kW is developed for city Bus Line 60 in Gothenburg, Sweden. There are some power quality issues towards the utility grid during the charger operation. The aim of this paper is to explain the project and to present the measurement results with respect to power quality issues. The main specifications of the battery, charger, charging infrastructure and bus route are explained. The measurement results show that the harmonic emission is within the prescribed limit despite the high amount of low-frequency harmonics because of a passive diode rectification. It is suggested to replace the passive diode rectifier with an active front-end converter to eliminate low order current harmonics and to obtain a unity power factor operation. The main contribution of this work is to demonstrate a practical example of an electric charging system for an electric public transport system in Gothenburg.},

ABSTRACT = {Structural, gaseous phase hydrogen storage, and electrochemical properties of a series of annealed (900 °C for 12 h) Laves phase-related body-centered-cubic (BCC) solid solution metal hydride (MH) alloys with vanadium/nickel (V/Ni) contents ranging from 44/18.5 to 28/34.5 were studied. As the average Ni-content increases, C14 phase evolves into the C15 phase and a new σ-VNi phase emerges; lattice constants in BCC, C14, and TiNi phase all decrease; the main plateau pressure increases; both gaseous phase and electrochemical hydrogen storage capacities decrease; the pressure-concentration-temperature (PCT) absorption/desorption hysteresis decreases; both high-rate dischargeability (HRD) and bulk hydrogen diffusivity increase and then decrease; and the surface reaction current decreases. There is a capacity-rate tradeoff with the change in V/Ni content. Alloys with relatively lower Ni-content show higher capacities but inferior high-rate performance compared to commercially available AB5 MH alloy. Increasing the Ni-content in this BCC-based multi-phase alloy can improve the high-rate capability over AB5 alloy but with lower discharge capacities. The inferior surface reaction current in these alloys, compared to AB5, may be due to the smaller surface area, not the total volume, of the Ni clusters embedded in the surface oxide layer of the activated alloys.},

ABSTRACT = {KOH-based electrolytes with different salt additives were investigated to reduce their corrosive nature toward Mg/Ni metal hydride alloys used as negative electrodes in nickel metal hydride (Ni/MH) batteries. Alkaline metal halide salts and oxyacid salts were studied as additives to the traditional KOH electrolyte with concentrations varying from 0.005 M to 1.77 M. Effects of the cations and anions of the additives on charge/discharge performance are discussed. The reduction potential of alkaline cations and radii of halogen anions were correlated with initial capacity and degradation of the metal hydride alloy. A synergistic effect between KOH and some oxyacid salt additives was observed and greatly influenced by the nature of the salt additives. It was suggested that both the formation of a solid film over the metal hydride surface and the promotion of proton transfer in the additives containing electrolytes led to a decreased degradation of the electrodes and an increased discharge capacity. 12 salt additives, NaC2H3O2, KC2H3O2, K2CO3, Rb2CO3, Cs2CO3, K3PO4, Na2WO4, Rb2SO4, Cs2SO4, NaF, KF, and KBr, were found to increase the corrosion resistance of the MgNi-based metal hydride alloy.},

ABSTRACT = {Structure, gaseous phase hydrogen storage, and electrochemical properties of a series of TiVCrMn-based body-centered-cubic (BCC) alloys with different partial substitutions for Mn with covalent elements (B and Si), transition metals (Ni, Zr, Nb, and Mo), and rare earth element (La) were investigated. Although the influences from substitutions on structure and gaseous phase storage properties were minor, influences on electrochemical discharge capacity were significant. The first cycle capacity ranged from 16 mAh·g−1 (Si-substituted) to 247 mAh·g−1 (Mo-substituted). Severe alloy passivation in 30% KOH electrolyte was observed, and an original capacity close to 500 mAh·g−1 could possibly be achieved by Mo-substituted alloy if a non-corrosive electrolyte was employed. Surface coating of Nafion to the Mo-substituted alloy was able to increase the first cycle capacity to 408 mAh·g−1, but the degradation rate in mAh·g−1·cycle−1 was still similar to that of standard testing. Electrochemical capacity was found to be closely related to BCC phase unit cell volume and width of the an extra small pressure plateau at around 0.3 MPa on the 30 °C pressure-concentration-temperature (PCT) desorption isotherm. Judging from its high electrochemical discharge capacity, Mo was the most beneficial substitution in BCC alloys for Ni/metal hydride (MH) battery application.},

Here we study the electrochemical properties of the system Na2Fe1−xMnxP2O7 (x = 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1). By means of cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic experiments, we confirm that pure Fe and Fe-rich compounds are promising for application in sodium batteries, whereas Mn-rich samples are less satisfactory, at least in case of solid-state reaction recipes and standard slurry preparations. Proper carbon coating is likely needed to improve the electrochemical behavior of Mn-rich samples.},

ABSTRACT = {Lithium ion batteries play an increasing role in everyday life, giving power to handheld devices or being used in stationary storage solutions. Especially for medium or large scale solutions, the latter application confines a huge amount of energy within a small volume; however, increasing the hazard potential far above the common level. Furthermore, as the safety hazards of lithium ion cells have been known for years, impressively shown by several burning cars or laptops, the need for a further enhancement of the safety of these systems is rising. This manuscript presents measurements of the gas emission from lithium ion batteries in case of a malfunction for different scenarios, showing a large variety of species with mostly toxic to highly toxic properties. The measurements were carried out using a combination of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), quadrupole mass spectrometry (QMS), photoacoustic spectroscopy, and chemical analysis. It is shown that the inflammation of a cell can be overcome, also preventing a cascading effect to neighboring cells, but giving rise to worse toxic gas emission. Furthermore, a filtration concept is presented that decreases the concentration of the emitted components significantly and promises filtration below immediately dangerous to life or health (IDLH) equivalent levels.},

ABSTRACT = {The surface microstructure of an activated Si-containing AB2 metal hydride (MH) alloy was investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). Regions of the main AB2 and the secondary TiNi (B2 structure) phases directly underneath the surface Zr oxide/hydroxide layers are considered electrochemically inactive. The surface of AB2 is covered, on the atomic scale, by sheets of Ni2O3 with direct access to electrolyte and voids, without the buffer oxide commonly seen in Si-free AB2 alloys. This clean oxide/bulk metal alloy interface is believed to be the main source of the improvements in the low-temperature performance of Si-containing AB2 alloys. Sporadic metallic-Ni clusters can be found in the surface Ni2O3 region. However, the density of these clusters is much lower than the Ni-inclusions found in most typical metal hydride surface oxides. A high density of nano-sized metallic Ni-inclusions (1–3 nm) is found in regions associated with the TiNi secondary phase, i.e., in the surface oxide layer and in the grain boundary, which can also contribute to enhancement of the electrochemical performance.},

ABSTRACT = {In this study we compared the electrochemical pressure-concentration-temperature (EPCT) method with the gaseous phase pressure-concentration-temperature (PCT) method and demonstrated the differences between the two. Experimentally, this was done by electrochemically charging/discharging the electrodes of four different metal hydride (MH) alloys. The results indicate that in the PCT curve is flatter with a smaller hysteresis and a higher storage capacity compared to the EPCT curve. Moreover, while the PCT curves (up to around one third of the hydrogen storage capacity) reside in between the charge and discharge EPCT curves, the rest of the PCT curves are below the EPCT curves. Finally, we demonstrated a new calibration method based on the inflection points observed in the EPCT isotherms of a physical mixture of more than one alloy. This turning point can be used to find a preset calibration point to determine the state-of-charge.},

ABSTRACT = {After the end of a charging or discharging sequence, the battery voltage keeps evolving towards a finite value, during hours or even days, although no current is exchanged with the battery. This corresponds to the battery relaxation. In the context of electric vehicles (EV), a good measurement of the voltage at rest allows an accurate estimation of the battery state of charge (SoC). The characterization of the battery voltage at different levels of SoC after the full relaxation would be very time consuming. In this paper, a fast method to extrapolate long relaxation voltage is proposed. It needs only one complete measurement of relaxation at one given SoC and could give accurate voltage estimation at other states of charge from short and partial measurement. This generic method was validated on three different cells and could be easily extended to any type of battery.},

ABSTRACT = {Within the scope of developing a multi-physical model describing battery behavior during and after the mechanical load (accelerations, intrusions) of a vehicle’s high voltage battery, an internal short circuit model is of deep interest for a virtual hazard assessment. The internal short resistance and the size of the affected area must be known as a minimum for determining the released heat and, in consequence, the temperatures. The internal short resistance of purpose-built dummy pouch cells, filled with electrolyte-like solvent without conductive salt, has thus been measured in a given short area under various compressive loads. The resistances for different short scenarios obtained are analyzed and described in a mathematical form. Short circuit experiments with dummy cells using an external power source have also been carried out. This set-up allows the measurement of the temperature evolution at a known current and a determination of the actual short resistance. The post-mortem analysis of the samples shows a correlation between the maximum temperatures, released short heat and the separator melt diameter.},

It was found that in a fire, cells with higher state of charge (SOC) gave a higher heat release rate (HRR), while the total heat release (THR) had a lower correlation with SOC. One fire test resulted in a hazardous projectile from a cylindrical cell. In the fire tests, toxic gas emissions of hydrogen fluoride (HF) were measured for 100%, 50% and 0% SOC.},

ABSTRACT = {Mg, the A-site atom in C14 (MgZn2), C15 (MgCu2), and C36 (MgNi2) Laves phase alloys, was added to the Zr-based AB2 metal hydride (MH) alloy during induction melting. Due to the high melting temperature of the host alloy (>1500 °C) and high volatility of Mg in the melt, the Mg content of the final ingot is limited to 0.8 at%. A new Mg-rich cubic phase was found in the Mg-containing alloys with a small phase abundance, which contributes to a significant increase in hydrogen storage capacities, the degree of disorder (DOD) in the hydride, the high-rate dischargeability (HRD), and the charge-transfer resistances at both room temperature (RT) and −40 °C. This phase also facilitates the activation process in measurement of electrochemical discharge capacity. Moreover, through a correlation study, the Ni content was found to be detrimental to the storage capacities, while Ti content was found to be more influential in HRD and charge-transfer resistance in this group of AB2 metal hydride (MH) alloys.},

ABSTRACT = {The effect of calendar aging on the thermal safety of 4.6 Ah pouch cells with a LiMn2O4 (LMO) cathode was investigated by a battery test calorimeter (BTC) that can be used to determine the heat evolved during an uncontrolled exothermic runaway reaction. Cells were stored at 55 °C and 100% state of charge (SOC) for accelerated aging, and they were taken out after 10, 20, 40, 68, and 90 days of storage to obtain different aging states. Those cells were then put into the BTC for thermal safety tests. The results show the cell thermal safety improves after aging: (1) the self-heating temperature increases; (2) the thermal runaway temperature increases; and (3) the exothermal rate during the process of thermal runaway decreases. The cell voltage drops to zero about 40 °C earlier than the thermal runaway, indicating the voltage can be used as a signal for cell safety monitoring.},

ABSTRACT = {Lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries undergo complex electrochemical and mechanical degradation. This complexity is pronounced in applications such as electric vehicles, where highly demanding cycles of operation and varying environmental conditions lead to non-trivial interactions of ageing stress factors. This work presents the framework for an ageing diagnostic tool based on identifying and then tracking the evolution of model parameters of a fundamental electrochemistry-based battery model from non-invasive voltage/current cycling tests. In addition to understanding the underlying mechanisms for degradation, the optimisation algorithm developed in this work allows for rapid parametrisation of the pseudo-two dimensional (P2D), Doyle-Fuller-Newman, battery model. This is achieved through exploiting the embedded symbolic manipulation capabilities and global optimisation methods within MapleSim. Results are presented that highlight the significant reductions in the computational resources required for solving systems of coupled non-linear partial differential equations.},

ABSTRACT = {Residential photovoltaic (PV) battery systems increase households’ electricity self-consumption using rooftop PV systems and thus reduce the electricity bill. High investment costs of battery systems, however, prevent positive financial returns for most present residential battery installations in Germany. Tesla Motors, Inc. (Palo Alto, CA, USA) announced a novel battery system—the Powerwall—for only about 25% of the current German average market price. According to Tesla’s CEO Elon Musk, Germany is one of the key markets for their product. He has, however, not given numbers to support his statement. In this paper, we analyze the economic benefit of the Powerwall for end-users with respect to various influencing parameters: electricity price, aging characteristics of the batteries, topology of battery system coupling, subsidy schemes, and retrofitting of existing PV systems. Simulations show that three key-factors strongly influence economics: the price gap between electricity price and remuneration rate, the battery system’s investment cost, and the usable battery capacity. We reveal under which conditions a positive return on invest can be achieved and outline that the Powerwall could be a worthwhile investment in multiple, but not all, scenarios investigated. Resulting trends are generally transferrable to other home storage products.},

ABSTRACT = {The electrochemical reactions of multi-phase metal hydride (MH) alloys were studied using a series of Laves phase-related body-centered-cubic (BCC) Ti15.6Zr2.1V43Cr11.2Mn6.9Co1.4Ni18.5Al0.3X (X = V, B, Mg, Y, Zr, Nb, Mo, La, and Nd) alloys. These alloys are composed of BCC (major), TiNi (major), C14 (minor), and Ti2Ni (minor) phases. The BCC phase was found to be responsible for the visible equilibrium pressure plateau between 0.1 MPa and 1 MPa. The plateaus belonging to the other phases occurred below 0.005 MPa. Due to the synergetic effects of other non-BCC phases, the body-centered-tetragonal (BCT) intermediate step is skipped and the face-centered-cubic (FCC) hydride phase is formed directly. During hydrogenation in both gaseous phase and electrochemistry, the non-BCC phases were first charged to completion, followed by charging of the BCC phase. In the multi-phase system, the side with a higher work function along the grain boundary is believed to be the first region that becomes hydrogenated and will not be fully dehydrided after 8 h in vacuum at 300 °C. While there is a large step at approximately 50% of the maximum hydrogen storage for the equilibrium pressure measured in gaseous phase, the charge/discharge curves measured electrochemically are very smooth, indicating a synergetic effect between BCC and non-BCC phases in the presence of voltage and charge non-neutrality. Compared to the non-BCC phases, the C14 phase benefits while the TiNi phase deteriorates the high-rate dischargeability (HRD) of the alloys. These synergetic effects are explained by the preoccupied hydrogen sites on the side of the hydrogen storage phase near the grain boundary.},

ABSTRACT = {The feasibility of utilizing disordered Ni-based metal hydroxide, as both the anode and the cathode materials, in alkaline rechargeable batteries was validated for the first time. Co and Mn were introduced into the hexagonal Ni(OH)2 crystal structure to create disorder and defects that resulted in a conductivity increase. The highest discharge capacity of 55.6 mAh·g−1 was obtained using a commercial Li-ion cathode precursor, specifically NCM111 hydroxide, as anode material in the Ni-Ni battery. Charge/discharge curves, cyclic voltammetry (CV), X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analysis, and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) were used to study the capacity degradation mechanism, and the segregation of Ni, Co, and Mn hydroxides in the mixed hydroxide. Further optimization of composition and control in micro-segregation are needed to increase the discharge capacity closer to the theoretical value, 578 mAh·g−1.},

ABSTRACT = {This work reported a solid-state method to prepare LiFe0.5Mn0.5PO4/C (LFMP/C) composite cathode materials by using LiH2PO4, MnO2, Fe2O3, citric acid (C6H8O7), and sucrose (C12H22O11). The citric acid was used as a complex agent and C12H22O11 was used as a carbon source. Two novel hollow carbon sphere (HCS) and nanoporous graphene (NP-GNS) additives were added into the LFMP/C composite to enhance electrochemical performance. The HCS and NP-GNS were prepared via a simple hydrothermal process. The characteristic properties of the composite cathode materials were examined by micro-Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), elemental analysis (EA), and alternating current (AC) impedance methods. The coin cell was used to investigate the electrochemical performance at various rates. It was found that the specific discharge capacities of LFMP/C + 2% NP-GNS + 2% HCS composite cathode materials were 161.18, 154.71, 148.82, and 120.00 mAh·g−1 at 0.1C, 0.2C, 1C, and 10C rates, respectively. Moreover, they all showed the coulombic efficiency ca. 97%–98%. The advantage of the one-pot solid-state method can be easily scaled up for mass-production, as compared with the sol-gel method or hydrothermal method. Apparently, the LFMP/C composite with HCS and NP-GNS conductors can be a good candidate for high-power Li-ion battery applications.},

ABSTRACT = {“The Hearing Aid Compatibility Act of 1988 (HAC Act) generally requires that the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) ensure that telephones manufactured or imported for use in the United States after August 1989, and all ‘essential’ telephones, are hearing aid-compatible”. The electromagnetic field (EMF) emission is generated by electrical currents in the phones’ circuit boards and components, including the battery. Here, we have investigated design changes to reduce the EMF from Lithium Ion (Li-ion) batteries. Changes mainly include: (1) Li-ion cell internal positive/negative tab location and length on cathode/anode layers; and (2) Li-ion cell external positive/negative connectors spacing. Results show that the cell’s internal tab locations and spacing between the cell’s external connectors play critical roles in reduction of battery EMF emissions. It is important that cells’ design changes are compatible with the manufacturing processes.},

ABSTRACT = {The incorporation of a small amount of Co in the A2B7 superlattice hydrogen absorbing alloy (HAA) can benefit its electrochemical cycle life performance at both room temperature (RT) and 50 °C. The electrochemical properties of the Co-substituted A2B7 and the failure mechanisms of cells using such alloys cycled at RT have been reported previously. In this paper, the failure mechanisms of the same alloys cycled at 50 °C are reported. Compared to that at RT, the trend of the cycle life at 50 °C versus the Co content in the Co-substituted A2B7 HAAs is similar, but the cycle life is significantly shorter. Failure analysis of the cells at 50 °C was performed using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), and inductively coupled plasma (ICP) analysis. It was found that the elevated temperature accelerates electrolyte dry-out and the deterioration (both pulverization and oxidation) of the A2B7 negative electrode, which are major causes of cell failure when cycling at 50 °C. Cells from HAA with higher Co-content also showed micro-shortage in the separator from the debris of the corrosion of the negative electrode.},

By using EBSD, we were able to identify the alignment of the crystallographic orientations of the three major phases in the alloys (C14, bcc, and B2 structures). This finding confirms the presence of crystallographically sharp interfaces between neighboring phases, which is a basic assumption for synergetic effects in a multi-phase MH system.},

ABSTRACT = {Synergetic effects in multi-phased AB2 Laves-phase-based metal hydride (MH) alloys enable the access of high hydrogen storage secondary phases, despite the lower absorption/desorption kinetics found in nickel/metal hydride (Ni/MH) batteries. Alloy design strategies to further tune the electrochemical properties of these secondary phases include the use of additives and processing techniques to manipulate the chemical nature and the microstructure of these materials. It is also of particular interest to observe the engineering of constitutional point defects and how they may affect electrochemical properties and performance. The Zr7Ni10 phase appears particularly prone to point defects, and we use density functional theory (DFT) calculations coupled with a statistical mechanics model to study the theoretical point defects. The Zr2Ni7 phase appears less prone to point defects, and we use the Zr2Ni7 point defect model, as well as experimental lattice parameters, with Zr7Ni10 phases from X-ray diffraction (XRD) as points of comparison. The point defect models indicate that anti-site defects tend to form in the Zr7Ni10 phase, and that these defects form more easily in the Zr7Ni10 phase than the Zr2Ni7 phase, as expected.},

ABSTRACT = {Structural, gaseous phase hydrogen storage, and electrochemical properties of a series of the Ti50Zr1Ni44X5 (X = Ni, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, or Cu) metal hydride alloys were studied. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed the multi-phase nature of all alloys, which were composed of a stoichiometric TiNi matrix, a hyperstoichiometric TiNi minor phase, and a Ti2Ni secondary phase. Improvement in synergetic effects between the main TiNi and secondary Ti2Ni phases, determined by the amount of distorted lattice region in TiNi near Ti2Ni, was accomplished by the substitution of an element with a higher work function, which consequently causes a dramatic increase in gaseous phase hydrogen storage capacity compared to the Ti50Zr1Ni49 base alloy. Capacity performance is further enhanced in the electrochemical environment, especially in the cases of the Ti50Zr1Ni49 base alloy and Ti50Zr1Ni44Co5 alloy. Although the TiNi-based alloys in the current study show poorer high-rate performances compared to the commonly used AB5, AB2, and A2B7 alloys, they have adequate capacity performances and also excel in terms of cost and cycle stability. Among the alloys investigated, the Ti50Zr1Ni44Fe5 alloy demonstrated the best balance among capacity (394 mAh·g−1), high-rate performance, activation, and cycle stability and is recommended for follow-up full-cell testing and as the base composition for future formula optimization. A review of previous research works regarding the TiNi metal hydride alloys is also included.},

ABSTRACT = {Effects of substitutions of rare earth (RE) elements (Y, La, Ce, and Nd) to the Zr-based AB2 multi-phase metal hydride (MH) alloys on the structure, gaseous phase hydrogen storage (H-storage), and electrochemical properties were studied and compared. Solubilities of the RE atoms in the main Laves phases (C14 and C15) are very low, and therefore the main contributions of the RE additives are through the formation of the RENi phase and change in TiNi phase abundance. Both the RENi and TiNi phases are found to facilitate the bulk diffusion of hydrogen but impede the surface reaction. The former is very effective in improving the activation behaviors. −40 °C performances of the Ce-doped alloys are slightly better than the Nd-doped alloys but not as good as those of the La-doped alloys, which gained the improvement through a different mechanism. While the improvement in ultra-low-temperature performance of the Ce-containing alloys can be associated with a larger amount of metallic Ni-clusters embedded in the surface oxide, the improvement in the La-containing alloys originates from the clean alloy/oxide interface as shown in an earlier transmission electron microscopy study. Overall, the substitution of 1 at% Ce to partially replace Zr gives the best electrochemical performances (capacity, rate, and activation) and is recommended for all the AB2 MH alloys for electrochemical applications.},

ABSTRACT = {The microstructures of two metal hydride (MH) alloys, a Zr7Ni10 based Ti15Zr26Ni59 and a C14 Laves phase based Ti12Zr21.5V10Ni36.2Cr4.5Mn13.6Sn0.3Co2.0Al0.4, were studied using the electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) technique. The first alloy was found to be composed of completely aligned Zr7Ni10 grains with a ZrO2 secondary phase randomly scattered throughout and a C15 secondary phase precipitated along the grain boundary. Two sets of orientation alignments were found between the Zr7Ni10 grains and the C15 phase: (001)Zr7Ni10A//(110)C15 and [100]Zr7Ni10A//[0 1 ¯ 1]C15, and (01 1 ¯ )Zr7Ni10B//( 1 ¯ 00)C15 and [100]Zr7Ni10B//[313]C15. The grain growth direction is close to [313]Zr7Ni10B//[ 1 ¯ 11]C15. The second alloy is predominated by a C14 phase, as observed from X-ray diffraction analysis. Both the matrix and dendrite seen through a scanning electron microscope arise from the same C14 structure with a similar chemical composition, but different orientations, as the matrix with the secondary phases in the form of intervening Zr7Ni10/Zr9Ni11/(Zr,Ni)Ti needle-like phase coated with a thin layer of C15 phase. The crystallographic orientation of the C15 phase is in alignment with the neighboring C14 phase, with the following relationships: (111)C15//(0001)C14 and [1 1 ¯ 0]C15//[11 2 ¯ 0]C14. The alignments in crystallographic orientations among the phases in these two multi-phase MH alloys confirm the cleanliness of the interface (free of amorphous region), which is necessary for the hydrogen-storage synergetic effects in both gaseous phase reaction and electrochemistry.},

ABSTRACT = {Compositions of MgNi-based amorphous-monocrystalline thin films produced by radio frequency (RF) sputtering with a varying composition target have been optimized. The composition Mg52Ni39Co3Mn6 is identified to possess the highest initial discharge capacity of 640 mAh·g−1 with a 50 mA·g−1 discharge current density. Reproduction in bulk form of Mg52Ni39Co3Mn6 alloy composition was prepared through a combination of melt spinning (MS) and mechanical alloying (MA), shows a sponge-like microstructure with >95% amorphous content, and is chosen as the metal hydride (MH) alloy for a sequence of electrolyte experiments with various hydroxides including LiOH, NaOH, KOH, RbOH, CsOH, and (C2H5)4N(OH). The electrolyte conductivity is found to be closely related to cation size in the hydroxide compound used as 1 M additive to the 4 M KOH aqueous solution. The degradation performance of Mg52Ni39Co3Mn6 alloy through cycling demonstrates a strong correlation with the redox potential of the cation in the alkali hydroxide compound used as 1 M additive to the 5 M KOH aqueous solution. NaOH, CsOH, and (C2H5)4N(OH) additions are found to achieve a good balance between corrosion and conductivity performances.},

ABSTRACT = {Charge-discharge properties of the surface-modified ZrNi negative electrodes with different degrees of boiling alkaline treatment were investigated. The boiling alkaline treatment was performed by immersing the ZrNi electrode in a boiling 6 M KOH aqueous solution for 2 h or 4 h. The initial discharge capacity for the untreated ZrNi negative electrode was 21 mAh·g−1, but it was increased to 114 mAh·g−1 and 308 mAh·g−1 after the boiling alkaline treatments for 2 h and 4 h, respectively. The discharge capacity for the ZrNi negative electrode after the treatment for 2 h steadily increased with repeating charge-discharge cycles as well as that of the untreated electrode, whereas that for the ZrNi negative electrode after the 4 h treatment greatly decreased. The high rate of dischargeability was improved with an increase in the treatment period of time, and the charge-transfer resistance was drastically decreased. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and electron dispersive X-ray spectroscopy demonstrated the ZrO2 passive layer on the ZrNi alloy surface was removed by the boiling alkaline treatment to form a porous morphology containing Ni(OH)2, which can be reduced to Ni during charging, leading to the reduction of a barrier for the charge-discharge reactions.},

ABSTRACT = {The cell case temperature versus time profiles of a multistage fast charging technique (4C-1C-constant voltage (CV))/fast discharge (4C) in a 2.3 Ah cylindrical lithium-ion cell are analyzed using a thermal model. Heat generation is dominated by the irreversible component associated with cell overpotential, although evidence of the reversible component is also observed, associated with the heat related to entropy from the electrode reactions. The final charging stages (i.e., 1C-CV) significantly reduce heat generation and cell temperature during charge, resulting in a thermally safe charging protocol. Cell heat capacity was determined from cell-specific heats and the cell materials’ thickness. The model adjustment of the experimental data during the 2 min resting period between discharge and charge allowed us to calculate both the time constant of the relaxation process and the cell thermal resistance. The obtained values of these thermal parameters used in the proposed model are almost equal to those found in the literature for the same cell model, which suggests that the proposed model is suitable for its implementation in thermal management systems.},

ABSTRACT = {The effects of Fe partially replacing Ni in a misch metal-based superlattice hydrogen absorbing alloy (HAA) were studied. Addition of Fe increases the lattice constants and abundance of the main Ce2Ni7 phase, decreases the NdNi3 phase abundance, and increases the CaCu5 phase when the Fe content is above 2.3 at%. For the gaseous phase hydrogen storage (H-storage), Fe incorporation does not change the storage capacity or equilibrium pressure, but it does decrease the change in both entropy and enthalpy. With regard to electrochemistry, >2.3 at% Fe decreases both the full and high-rate discharge capacities due to the deterioration in both bulk transport (caused by decreased secondary phase abundance and consequent lower synergetic effect) and surface electrochemical reaction (caused by the lower volume of the surface metallic Ni inclusions). In a low-temperature environment (−40 °C), although Fe increases the reactive surface area, it also severely hinders the ability of the surface catalytic, leading to a net increase in surface charge-transfer resistance. Even though Fe increases the abundance of the beneficial Ce2Ni7 phase with a trade-off for the relatively unfavorable NdNi3 phase, it also deteriorates the electrochemical performance due to a less active surface. Therefore, further surface treatment methods that are able to increase the surface catalytic ability in Fe-containing superlattice alloys and potentially reveal the positive contributions that Fe provides structurally are worth investigating in the future.},

The method applies to additives of various kinds, including suspensions and gels. The approach is based on thermodynamics and leads to the definition of a region of admissible concentrations—the battery’s admissible range—where the battery can operate without suffering irreversible changes. An experimental procedure to determine this range is presented. The obtained results provide a way to assess the potential of electrolyte additives to improve the energy capacity of Pb-acid batteries. They also provide a means to determine the additive concentration that produces the maximum energy capacity increase of the battery.

ABSTRACT = {The demand for batteries for energy storage is growing with the rapid increase in photovoltaics (PV) and wind energy installation as well as electric vehicle (EV), hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV). Electrochemical batteries have emerged as the preferred choice for most of the consumer product applications. Cost reduction of batteries will accelerate the growth in all of these sectors. Lithium-ion (Li-ion) and solid-state batteries are showing promise through their downward price and upward performance trends. We may achieve further performance improvement and cost reduction for Li-ion and solid-state batteries through reduction of the variation in physical and electrical properties. These properties can be improved and made uniform by considering the electrical model of batteries and adopting novel manufacturing approaches. Using quantum-photo effect, the incorporation of ultra-violet (UV) assisted photo-thermal processing can reduce metal surface roughness. Using in-situ measurements, advanced process control (APC) can help ensure uniformity among the constituent electrochemical cells. Industrial internet of things (IIoT) can streamline the production flow. In this article, we have examined the issue of electrochemical battery manufacturing of Li-ion and solid-state type from cell-level to battery-level process variability, and proposed potential areas where improvements in the manufacturing process can be made. By incorporating these practices in the manufacturing process we expect reduced cost of energy management system, improved reliability and yield gain with the net saving of manufacturing cost being at least 20%.},

ABSTRACT = {Aging assessment is critical for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) as the technology of choice for energy storage in electrified vehicles (EVs). Existing research is mainly focused on either increasing modeling precision or improving algorithm efficiency, while the significance of data applied for aging assessment has been largely overlooked. Moreover, reported studies are mostly confined to a specific condition without considering the impacts of diverse usage patterns on battery aging, which is practically challenging and can greatly affect battery degradation. This paper addresses these issues through incremental capacity (IC) analysis, which can both utilize data directly available from on-board sensors and interpret degradations from a physics-based perspective. Through IC analysis, the optimal health feature (HF) and the state of charge (SOC)-based optimal data profile for battery aging assessment have been identified. Four stress factors, i.e., depth-of-discharge (DOD), charging C-rate, operating mode, and temperature, have been selected to jointly characterize diverse usage patterns. Impact analysis of different stress factors through the optimal HF with the SOC-based optimal data profile from aging campaign experiments have generated practical guidance on usage patterns to improve battery health monitoring and lifetime control strategies.},

ABSTRACT = {Lithium-rich layered oxide cathode materials of Li1.2Mn0.5100Ni0.2175Co0.0725O2 have been synthesized using metal salts with acetate and nitrate anions as precursors in glycerol solvent. The effects of the precursor metal salts on particle size, morphology, cationic ordering, and ultimately, the electrode performance of the cathode powders have been studied. It was demonstrated that the use of cornstarch as a gelling agent with nitrate-based metal salts results in a reduction of particle size, leading to higher surface area and initial discharge capacity. However, the cornstarch gelling effect was minimized when acetate salts were used. As observed in the Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy analysis, cornstarch can react with acetates to form acetyl groups during the synthesis, effectively preventing the cornstarch gel from capping the particles, thus leading to larger particles. A tradeoff was found when nitrate and acetate salts were mixed in the synthesis. It was shown that the new cathode powder has the best cationic ordering and capacity retention, promising a much stable Li-rich cathode material for lithium-ion batteries.},

ABSTRACT = {To draw reliable conclusions about the thermal characteristic of or a preferential cooling strategy for a lithium–ion battery, the correct set of thermal input parameters and a detailed battery layout is crucial. In our previous work, an electrochemical model for a commercially-available, 40 Ah prismatic lithium–ion battery was validated under heuristic temperature dependence. In this work the validated electrochemical model is coupled to a spatially resolved, three dimensional (3D), thermal model of the same battery to evaluate the thermal characteristics, i.e., thermal barriers and preferential heat rejection patterns, within common environment layouts. We discuss to which extent the knowledge of the batteries’ interior layout can be constructively used for the design of an exterior battery thermal management. It is found from the study results that: (1) Increasing the current rate without considering an increased heat removal flux at natural convection at higher temperatures will lead to increased model deviations; (2) Centralized fan air-cooling within a climate chamber in a multi cell test arrangement can lead to significantly different thermal characteristics at each battery cell; (3) Increasing the interfacial surface area, at which preferential battery interior and exterior heat rejection match, can significantly lower the temperature rise and inhomogeneity within the electrode stack and increase the batteries’ lifespan.},

ABSTRACT = {With respect to aeronautical applications, the state-of-charge (SOC) and state-of-health (SOH) of rechargeable nickel–cadmium batteries was investigated with the help of the frequency-dependent reactance Im Z(ω) and the pseudo-capacitance C(ω) in the frequency range between 1 kHz and 0.1 Hz. The method of SOC monitoring using impedance spectroscopy is evaluated with the example of 1.5-year long-term measurements of commercial devices. A linear correlation between voltage and capacitance is observed as long as overcharge and deep discharge are avoided. Pseudo-charge Q(ω) = C(ω)⋅U at 1 Hz with respect to the rated capacity is proposed as a reliable SOH indicator for rapid measurements. The benefit of different evaluation methods and diagram types for impedance data is outlined.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper presents research on the synergistic effects of nickel molybdate and reduced graphene oxide as a nanocomposite for further development of energy storage systems. An enhancement in the electrochemical performance of supercapacitor electrodes occurs by synthesizing highly porous structures and achieving more surface area. In this work, a chemical precipitation technique was used to synthesize the NiMoO4/3D-rGO nanocomposite in a starch media. Starch was used to develop the porosities of the nanostructure. A temperature of 350 °C was applied to transform graphene oxide sheets to reduced graphene oxide and remove the starch to obtain the NiMoO4/3D-rGO nanocomposite with porous structure. The X-ray diffraction pattern of the NiMoO4 nano particles indicated a monoclinic structure. Also, the scanning electron microscope observation showed that the NiMoO4 NPs were dispersed across the rGO sheets. The electrochemical results of the NiMoO4/3D-rGO electrode revealed that the incorporation of rGO sheets with NiMoO4 NPs increased the capacity of the nanocomposite. Therefore, a significant increase in the specific capacity of the electrode was observed with the NiMoO4/3D-rGO nanocomposite (450 Cg−1 or 900 Fg−1) when compared with bare NiMoO4 nanoparticles (350 Cg−1 or 700 Fg−1) at the current density of 1 A g−1. Our findings show that the incorporation of rGO and NiMoO4 NP redox reactions with a porous structure can benefit the future development of supercapacitors.},

ABSTRACT = {As storage technology in electric vehicles, lithium-ion cells are subject to a continuous aging process during their service life that, in the worst case, can lead to a premature system failure. Battery manufacturers thus have an interest in the aging prediction during the early design phase, for which semi-empirical aging models are often used. The progress of aging is dependent on the application-specific load profile, more precisely on the aging-relevant stress factors. Still, a literature review reveals a controversy on the aging-relevant stress factors to use as input parameters for the simulation models. It shows that, at present, a systematic and efficient procedure for stress factor selection is missing, as the aging characteristic is cell-specific. In this study, an accelerated sensitivity analysis as a prior step to aging modeling is proposed, which is transferable and allows to determine the actual aging-relevant stress factors for a specific lithium-ion cell. For the assessment of this accelerated approach, two test series with different acceleration levels and cell types are performed and evaluated. The results show that a certain amount of charge throughput, 100 equivalent full cycles in this case, is necessary to conduct a statistically significant sensitivity analysis.},

ABSTRACT = {The flow field design and material composition of the electrode plays an important role in the performance of redox flow batteries, especially when using highly viscous liquids. To enhance the discharge power density of zinc slurry air flow batteries, an optimum slurry distribution in the cell is key. Hence, several types of flow fields (serpentine, parallel, plastic flow frames) were tested in this study to improve the discharge power density of the battery. The serpentine flow field delivered a power density of 55 mW∙cm−2, while parallel and flow frame resulted in 30 mW∙cm−2 and 10 mW∙cm−2, respectively. Moreover, when the anode bipolar plate material was changed from graphite to copper, the power density of the flow frame increased to 65 mW∙cm−2, and further improvement was attained when the bipolar plate material was further changed to copper–nickel. These results show the potential to increase the power density of slurry-based flow batteries by flow field optimization and design of bipolar plate materials.},

ABSTRACT = {Recycling of metals from different waste streams must be increased in the near future for securing the availability of metals that are critical for high-tech applications, such as batteries for e-mobility. Black copper smelting is a flexible recycling route for many different types of scrap, including Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) and some end-of-life energy storage materials. Fundamental thermodynamic data about the behavior of battery metals and the effect of slag additives is required for providing data necessary for process development, control, and optimization. The goal of our study is to investigate the suitability of black copper smelting process for recycling of battery metals lithium, cobalt, manganese, and lanthanum. The experiments were performed alumina crucibles at 1300 °C, in oxygen partial pressure range of 10−11–10−8 atm. The slags studied contained 0 to 6 wt% of MgO. Electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) and laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) techniques were utilized for phase composition quantifications. The results reveal that most cobalt can be recovered into the copper alloy in extremely reducing process conditions, whereas lithium, manganese, and lanthanum deport predominantly in the slag at all investigated oxygen partial pressures.},

ABSTRACT = {Activated carbon (AC) with a very high specific surface area of >3000 m2 g−1 and a number of course particles (average size: 75 µm) was pulverized by means of planetary ball milling under different conditions to find its greatest performances as the active material of an electric double-layer capacitor (EDLC) using a nonaqueous electrolyte. The variations in textural properties and particle morphology of the AC during the ball milling were investigated. The electrochemical performance (specific capacitance, rate and cyclic stabilities, and Ragone plot, both from gravimetric and volumetric viewpoints) was also evaluated for the ACs milled with different particle size distributions. A trade-off relation between the pulverization and the porosity maintenance of the AC was observed within the limited milling time. However, prolonged milling led to a degeneration of pores within the AC and a saturation of pulverization degree. The appropriate milling time provided the AC a high volumetric specific capacitance, as well as the greatest maintenance of both the gravimetric and volumetric specific capacitance. A high volumetric energy density of 6.6 Wh L−1 was attained at the high-power density of 1 kW L−1, which was a 35% increment compared with the nonmilled AC. The electrode densification (decreased interparticle gap) and the enhanced ion-transportation within the AC pores, which were attributed to the pulverization, were responsible for those excellent performances. It was also shown that excessive milling could degrade the EDLC performances because of the lowered micro- and meso-porosity and the excessive electrode densification to restrict the ion-transportation within the pores.},

ABSTRACT = {The range of electrode porosity, electrode internal void volume, cell capacity, and capacity ratio that result from electrode coating and calendering tolerance can play a considerable role in cell-to-cell and lot-to-lot performance variation. Based on a coating loading tolerance of ±0.4 mg/cm2 and calender tolerance of ±3.0 μm, the resulting theoretical range of physical properties was investigated. For a target positive electrode porosity of 30%, the resulting porosity can range from 19.6% to 38.6%. To account for this variation during the manufacturing process, as much as 41% excess or as little as 59% of the target electrolyte quantity should be added to cells to match the positive electrode void volume. Similar results are reported for a negative electrode of 40% target porosity, where a range from 30.8% to 48.0% porosity is possible. For the negative electrode as little as 72% up to 28% excess electrolyte should be added to fill the internal void space. Although the results are specific to each electrode composition, density, chemistry, and loading the presented process highlight the possible variability of the produced parts. These results are further magnified as cell design moves toward higher power applications with thinner electrode coatings.},

ABSTRACT = {Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are gaining importance in the automotive sector because of the potential of electric vehicles (EVs) to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution. However, there are serious hazards resulting from failing battery cells leading to exothermic chemical reactions inside the cell, called thermal runaway (TR). Literature of quantifying the failing behavior of modern automotive high capacity cells is rare and focusing on single hazard categories such as heat generation. Thus, the aim of this study is to quantify several hazard relevant parameters of a failing currently used battery cell extracted from a modern mass-produced EV: the temperature response of the cell, the maximum reached cell surface temperature, the amount of produced vent gas, the gas venting rate, the composition of the produced gases including electrolyte vapor and the size and composition of the produced particles at TR. For this purpose, overtemperature experiments with fresh 41 Ah automotive lithium NMC/LMO—graphite pouch cells at different state-of-charge (SOC) 100%, 30% and 0% are performed. The results are valuable for firefighters, battery pack designers, cell recyclers, cell transportation and all who deal with batteries.},

ABSTRACT = {Lithium-ion batteries are extensively used for electric vehicles, owing to their great power and energy density. A battery thermal management system is essential for lithium-ion batteries. With the extensive utilization of liquid-cooling approaches for lithium-ion batteries’ thermal management, temperature homogeneity is considerably influenced by coolant distribution. A lower temperature of the cooling fluid brings about a lower temperature of the cell, but the relation and the amount are important to be analyzed. The cooling efficiency is considerably influenced by the flowing conduit arrangement in the cooling plate. Different parameters are affected by the cooling performance of the battery pack. Consequently, the effect of entrance temperature of coolant fluid, current rate, environment temperature, entrance velocity of the coolant fluid, and plate material on the performance and efficiency of a battery thermal management system were investigated. In this investigation, the program ANSYS/FLUENT was employed as the numerical solver to solve the problem. The simulation was accomplished after the end of the discharge. It was seen that the temperature distributions were the most sensitive to the entrance velocity of coolant fluid. It was concluded that the entrance velocity of coolant fluid has the greatest impact on the cooling efficiency and performance of the cold plate.},

ABSTRACT = {Internal resistance is one of the important parameters in the Li-Ion battery. This paper identifies it using two different methods: electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and parameter estimation based on equivalent circuit model (ECM). Comparing internal resistance, the conventional parameter estimation method yields a different value than EIS. Therefore, a hysteresis-free parameter identification method based on ECM is proposed. The proposed technique separates hysteresis resistance from the effective resistance. It precisely estimated actual internal resistance, which matches the internal resistance obtained from EIS. In addition, state of charge, open circuit voltage, and different internal equivalent circuit components were identified. The least square method was used to identify the parameters based on ECM. A parameter extraction algorithm to interpret impedance spectrum obtained from the EIS. The algorithm is based on the properties of Nyquist plot, phasor algebra, and resonances. Experiments were conducted using a cellphone pouch battery and a cylindrical 18650 battery.},

ABSTRACT = {Cycling Li-ion cells with large capacities requires high currents and hence an expensive measurement setup. Aging the Li-ion cell material in coin cells offers an orders-of-magnitude-lower power requirement to the battery tester. The preparation procedure used in this work allows one to build coin cells in a reproducible manner. The original 40 Ah pouch cells and the corresponding 4.3 mAh coin cells (PAT-Cell) utilizing electrode material from the original cells are cycled with 1C at different temperatures. The results show the same basic aging mechanisms in both cell types: loss of lithium inventory at room temperature but an increasing proportion of loss of active material toward higher temperatures. This is confirmed by similar activation energies in capacity degradation of the 40 Ah cells and the averaged coin cells. However, the capacity of the coin cells decreases faster over time. This is caused by diffusion of moisture into the coin cell housing. Nonetheless, the increasing water contamination over measurement time is not directly linked to the loss of capacity of the coin cells. Thus, the observed aging mechanisms of the 40 Ah cells can be qualitatively transferred to coin cell level.},

ABSTRACT = {Lithium–oxygen (Li-O2) batteries require scalable air electrode concepts and a sensible choice of operation parameters to achieve their promised energy densities. Furthermore, different test parameters are often investigated individually, but rarely brought together in order to optimize the discharge process and unlock the full discharge capability of an air electrode. In this work, we present a highly porous electrode based on graphite nanosheets (GNS) and discuss the impact of the discharge current density and the oxygen pressure as battery test parameters, as well as the electrolyte salt and volume, on the discharge behavior. In particular, changing the electrolyte salt from LiNO3 to LiTFSI proved to be an important step towards better cell performance, because synergistic effects of the electrolyte and GNS greatly enhance the carbon-specific capacity. The optimized combination of the aforementioned parameters enabled a remarkably high discharge capacity of 56.3 mAh/cm2 (5860 mAh/gcarbon) obtained at 150 µA/cm2 (15.6 mA/gcarbon), resulting in the almost complete conversion of the lithium anode. These experimental results are an important step towards practical high-capacity air electrodes for Li-O2 batteries.},

The goal is to characterize an Li-ion cell and obtain its charging and discharging curves with different current rates and different cycle depths, as well as its transitory response. In addition, the results provided are represented and compared, and different methods of estimating the state of the batteries are applied. They include the dynamics of the electrolyte and the effects of aging caused by a high number of charging and discharging cycles of the batteries. A complete comparison with the three-parameter method (TPM) is represented in order to demonstrate the superiority of the applied methodology.},

ABSTRACT = {Common issues aqueous-based vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs) face include low cell voltage due to water electrolysis side reactions and highly corrosive and environmentally unfriendly electrolytes (3 to 5 M sulfuric acid). Therefore, this investigation looks into the comparison of a highly conductive ionic liquid with a well-studied deep eutectic solvent (DES) as electrolytes for non-aqueous VRFBs. The latter solvent gives 50% higher efficiency and capacity utilization than the former. These figures of merit increase by 10% when nitrogen-doped graphene (N-G)-modified carbon papers, via a one-step binder-free electrophoretic deposition process, are used as electrodes. X-ray computed tomography confirms the enhancement of electrochemical surface area of the carbon electrodes due to N-G while electrochemical impedance spectra show the effect of its higher conductivity on improving RFB performance. Finally, potential strategies for the scaling-up of DES-based VRFBs using a simple economical model are also briefly discussed. From this study, it is deduced that more investigations on applying DESs as non-aqueous electrolytes to replace the commonly used acetonitrile may be a positive step forward because DESs are not only cheaper but also safer to handle, far less toxic, non-flammable, and less volatile than acetonitrile.},

ABSTRACT = {The economic value of high-capacity battery systems, being used in a wide variety of automotive and energy storage applications, is strongly affected by the duration of their service lifetime. Because many battery systems now feature a very large number of individual cells, it is necessary to understand how cell-to-cell interactions can affect durability, and how to best replace poorly performing cells to extend the lifetime of the entire battery pack. This paper first examines the baseline results of aging individual cells, then aging of cells in a representative 3S3P battery pack, and compares them to the results of repaired packs. The baseline results indicate nearly the same rate of capacity fade for single cells and those aged in a pack; however, the capacity variation due to a few degrees changes in room temperature (≃±3 ∘ C) is significant (≃±1.5% of capacity of new cell) compared to the percent change of capacity over the battery life cycle in primary applications (≃20–30%). The cell replacement strategies investigation considers two scenarios: early life failure, where one cell in a pack fails prematurely, and building a pack from used cells for less demanding applications. Early life failure replacement found that, despite mismatches in impedance and capacity, a new cell can perform adequately within a pack of moderately aged cells. The second scenario for reuse of lithium ion battery packs examines the problem of assembling a pack for less-demanding applications from a set of aged cells, which exhibit more variation in capacity and impedance than their new counterparts. The cells used in the aging comparison part of the study were deeply discharged, recovered, assembled in a new pack, and cycled. We discuss the criteria for selecting the aged cells for building a secondary pack and compare the performance and coulombic efficiency of the secondary pack to the pack built from new cells and the repaired pack. The pack that employed aged cells performed well, but its efficiency was reduced.},

ABSTRACT = {Temperature prediction of a battery plays a significant role in terms of energy efficiency and safety of electric vehicles, as well as several kinds of electric and electronic devices. In this regard, it is crucial to identify an adequate model to study the thermal behavior of a battery. This article reports a comparative study on thermal modeling approaches by using a LiCoO2 26650 lithium-ion battery, and provides a methodology to characterize electrothermal phenomena. Three approaches have been implemented numerically—a thermal lumped model, a 3D computational fluid dynamics model, and an electrochemical model based on Newman, Tiedemann, Gu and Kim formulation. The last two methods were solved using ANSYS Fluent software. Simulations were validated with experimental measurements of the cell surface temperature at constant current discharge and under a highway driving cycle. Results show that the three models are consistent with actual temperature measurements. The electrochemical method has the lower error at 0.5C. Nevertheless, this model provides the higher error ( 1.3∘C) at 1.5C, where the maximum temperature increase of the cell was 18.1∘C. Under the driving cycle, all the models are in the same order of error. Lumped model is suitable to simulate a wide range of battery operating conditions. Furthermore, this work was expanded to study heat generation, voltage and heat transfer coefficient under natural convection.},

ABSTRACT = {The purpose of this paper is to analyze the accuracy of three state of charge (SOC) estimators of a rechargeable Li-ion SAFT battery based on two accurate Li-ion battery models, namely a linear RC equivalent electrical circuit (ECM) and a nonlinear Simscape generic model, developed in Part 1. The battery SOC of both Li-ion battery models is estimated using a linearized adaptive extended Kalman filter (AEKF), a nonlinear adaptive unscented Kalman filter (AUKF) and a nonlinear and non-Gaussian particle filter estimator (PFE). The result of MATLAB simulations shows the efficiency of all three SOC estimators, especially AEKF, followed in order of decreasing performance by AUKF and PFE. Besides, this result reveals a slight superiority of the SOC estimation accuracy when using the Simscape model for SOC estimator design. Overall, the performance of all three SOC estimators in terms of accuracy, convergence of response speed and robustness is excellent and is comparable to state of the art SOC estimation methods.},

ABSTRACT = {Battery state of charge (SOC) accuracy plays a vital role in a hybrid electric vehicle (HEV), as it ensures battery safety in a harsh operating environment, prolongs life, lowers the cost of energy consumption, and improves driving mileage. Therefore, accurate SOC battery estimation is the central idea of the approach in this research, which is of great interest to readers and increases the value of its application. Moreover, an accurate SOC battery estimate relies on the accuracy of the battery model parameters and its capacity. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to design, implement and analyze the SOC estimation accuracy of two battery models, which capture the dynamics of a rechargeable SAFT Li-ion battery. The first is a resistor capacitor (RC) equivalent circuit model, and the second is a generic Simscape model. The model validation is based on the generation and evaluation of the SOC residual error. The SOC reference value required for the calculation of residual errors is the value estimated by an ADVISOR 3.2 simulator, one of the software tools most used in automotive applications. Both battery models are of real interest as a valuable support for SOC battery estimation by using three model based Kalman state estimators developed in Part 2. MATLAB simulations results prove the effectiveness of both models and reveal an excellent accuracy.},

ABSTRACT = {Lithium (Li)-ion battery thermal management systems play an important role in electric vehicles because the performance and lifespan of the batteries are affected by the battery temperature. This study proposes a framework to establish equivalent circuit models (ECMs) that can reproduce the multi-physics phenomenon of Li-ion battery packs, which includes liquid cooling systems with a unified method. We also demonstrate its utility by establishing an ECM of the thermal management systems of the actual battery packs. Experiments simulating the liquid cooling of a battery pack are performed, and a three-dimensional (3D) model is established. The 3D model reproduces the heat generated by the battery and the heat transfer to the coolant. The results of the 3D model agree well with the experimental data. Further, the relationship between the flow rate and pressure drop or between the flow rate and heat transfer coefficients is predicted with the 3D model, and the data are used for the ECM, which is established using MATLAB Simulink. This investigation confirmed that the ECM’s accuracy is as high as the 3D model even though its computational costs are 96% lower than the 3D model.},

ABSTRACT = {The VO2+/VO2+ redox couple commonly employed on the positive terminal of the all-vanadium redox flow battery was investigated at various states of charge (SOC) and H2SO4 supporting electrolyte concentrations. Electron paramagnetic resonance was used to investigate the VO2+ concentration and translational and rotational diffusion coefficient (DT, DR) in both bulk solution and Nafion membranes. Values of DT and DR were relatively unaffected by SOC and on the order of 10−10 m2s−1. Cyclic voltammetry measurements revealed that no significant changes to the redox mechanism were observed as the state of charge increased; however, the mechanism does appear to be affected by H2SO4 concentration. Electron transfer rate (k0) increased by an order of magnitude (10−6 ms−1 to 10−8 ms−1) for each H2SO4 concentrations investigated (1, 3 and 5 M). Analysis of cyclic voltammetry switching currents suggests that the technique might be suitable for fast determination of state of charge if the system is well calibrated. Membrane uptake and permeability measurements show that vanadium absorption and crossover is more dependent on both acid and vanadium concentration than state of charge. Vanadium diffusion in the membrane is about an order of magnitude slower (~10−11 m2s−1) than in solution (~10−10 m2s−1).},

ABSTRACT = {Understanding dynamic behavior of a battery and the possibility of simulating it is necessary during design of IoT systems. This plays a critical role, especially for industrial devices with low-power demands planned for long lasting operation. While cost limitation mostly leads to use of the low-budget batteries with fast degradation, a model of these batteries supplying low-power loads is provided here. The overall model is in open-loop form because no access to the terminal measurements is available during the design phase. The identification process of the relation between the state of charge and related electromotive force as a key element of the model is discussed. Moreover, guidelines are suggested for identification of this relation. Furthermore, SoC estimation based on the Coulomb counting is modified to include a dynamic inter-cycle aging factor. This factor enables replication of the degradation within a single cycle. In spite of simplicity of this concept, it is able to reduce the model’s estimation error evaluated with two different types of loads. The overall model provides promising results with relative errors less than 0.2%.},

ABSTRACT = {Automation equipment with different functions from different manufacturers is common in lithium ion battery manufacturing workshops, which is manifested as heterogeneous data distributed at different network levels at the information level. The interconnection between a workshop system and equipment is the basis for realizing manufacturing informatization and intelligence, and is a core problem of intelligent manufacturing workshop integration. The key to solve this problem is to establish a standardized and consistent information model. Aiming at the problem of information interconnection, this paper established an information model of the intelligent manufacturing workshop of lithium ion batteries based on the analysis of the architecture, functional categories, and information interaction of the intelligent manufacturing workshop. Then, by clarifying the attribute set, component set, and the information objects contained in each information model, the hierarchical architecture of the information model was constructed. Then, the rules that map the information model in to the OLE for Process Control Unified Architecture (OPC UA) address space is established. The approach for implementing data storage and interaction of the information model based on the OPC UA server/client are also discussed. Finally, taking the soft-pack battery manufacturing workshop as an example, the information model is applied to realize the interconnection and interoperability of production management data, material management data, equipment management data, and quality management data among various levels of the workshop, which verifies the feasibility of the proposed information model.},

ABSTRACT = {Batteries as a multi-disciplinary field have been analyzed from the electrical, material science and electrochemical engineering perspectives. The first principle-based four-dimensional degradation model (4DM) of the battery is used in the article to connect the interdisciplinary sciences that deal with batteries. The 4DM is utilized to identify the physical manifestation that electrolyte degradation has on the battery and the response observed in the terminal voltage. This paper relates the different kinds of side reactions in the electrolyte and the material properties affected due to these side reactions. It goes on to explain the impact the material property changes has on the electrochemical reactions in the battery. This paper discusses how these electrochemical reactions affect the voltage across the terminals of the battery. We determine the relationship the change in the terminal voltage has due to the change in the design properties of the electrolyte. We also determine the impact the changes in the electrolyte material property have on the terminal voltage. In this paper, the lithium ion concentration and the transference number of the electrolyte are analyzed and the impact of their degradation is studied.},

ABSTRACT = {The capacitance of Lithium-ion Capacitors (LiCs) highly depends on their terminal voltage. Previous research found that it varies in a nonlinear manner with respect to the voltage. However, none of them modeled the capacitance evolution while considering the physicochemical phenomena that happen in a LiC cell. This paper focuses on developing a new capacitance model that is based on the Stern model of the electrochemical double layer capacitance. The model accounts for the asymmetric V-shape of the C(V) curve, which reflects the variation of the capacitance with respect to the voltage. The novelty of this study concerns the development of a model for LiCs that relies on the fundamental theory of Stern for the differential capacitance. The basic model of Stern is modified in order to account for the hybrid physicochemical structure of LiCs. Moreover, the model was applied to three aged cells to which accelerated calendar aging tests were applied at three voltage values: 2.2, 3 and 3.8 V. A drift of the voltage corresponding to the minimum capacitance was detected for the aged cells. This voltage is related to the neutral state of the positive electrode. The main cause of this phenomenon concerns the loss of lithium ions from the negative electrode of a LiC. In addition, capacitance values decreased after aging, showing an eventual blocking of the pores of the positive electrode. Therefore, the analysis of the C(V) curve was found to be an interesting tool for the interpretation of aging mechanisms.},

ABSTRACT = {The thermal behavior of a commercial lithium-ion cell with the cathode material LiNi0.6Mn0.2Co0.2O2 (NMC622) was investigated during the cycling process using a Tian-Calvet calorimeter (C80, SETARAM Instrumentation, France). Various current flows of 42.5, 85, and 170 mA corresponding to charging rates of 0.5, 1, and 2 C, respectively, were applied in the measurements. The corresponding heat flow rates were measured by the C80 calorimeter at 30 °C. The reversible heat effect due to the reversible electrochemical reaction was quantified by the entropy change measurement. The irreversible heat effect due to internal resistances was determined by the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and the galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT). The results were compared with the direct measurement of the heat effect by calorimetry during electrochemical cycling.},

ABSTRACT = {In this work, optimal siting and sizing of a battery energy storage system (BESS) in a distribution network with renewable energy sources (RESs) of distribution network operators (DNO) are presented to reduce the effect of RES fluctuations for power generation reliability and quality. The optimal siting and sizing of the BESS are found by minimizing the costs caused by the voltage deviations, power losses, and peak demands in the distribution network for improving the performance of the distribution network. The simulation results of the BESS installation were evaluated in the IEEE 33-bus distribution network. Genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) were adopted to solve this optimization problem, and the results obtained from these two algorithms were compared. After the BESS installation in the distribution network, the voltage deviations, power losses, and peak demands were reduced when compared to those of the case without BESS installation.},

ABSTRACT = {The impacts on battery cell ageing from high current operation are investigated using commercial cells. This study utilised two tests–(i) to establish the maximum current limits before cell failure and (ii) applying this maximum current until cell failure. Testing was performed to determine how far cycling parameters could progress beyond the manufacturer’s recommendations. Current fluxes were increased up to 100 C cycling conditions without the cell undergoing catastrophic failure. Charge and discharge current capabilities were possible at magnitudes of 1.38 and 4.4 times, respectively, more than that specified by the manufacturer’s claims. The increased current was used for longer term cycling tests to 500 cycles and the resulting capacity loss and resistance increase was dominated by thermal fatigue of the electrodes. This work shows that there is a discrepancy between manufacturer-stated current limits and actual current limits of the cell, before the cell undergoes catastrophic failure. This presumably is based on manufacturer-defined performance and lifetime criteria, as well as prioritised safety factors. For certain applications, e.g., where high performance is needed, this gap may not be suitable; this paper shows how this gap could be narrowed for these applications using the testing described herein.},

ABSTRACT = {Cobalt is a critical, high-value metal used extensively in batteries and other sustainable technologies. To secure its supply in future, it is utmost important to recover cobalt efficiently from industrial wastes and recycled End-of-Life batteries. This study aims at finding ways to improve the reduction of cobalt as well as valuable metals nickel and copper in nickel slag cleaning furnace conditions by using both traditional fossil-based coke and a more sustainable option, low-CO2 footprint biochar, as reductants. A cobalt-rich fraction of battery scrap (25.5 wt% Co) was also used as a secondary feed. The experimental technique consisted of reduction experiments with different times at 1400 °C under inert atmosphere, quick quenching and Electron Probe X-ray Microanalysis. The use of biochar resulted in faster reaction kinetics in the reduction process, compared to coke. Moreover, the presence of battery scrap had a clear impact on the behavior and reduction kinetics of the elements and/or enhanced settling and separation of matte and slag. The addition of scrap increased notably the distribution coefficients of the valuable metals but consequently also the iron concentration in matte which is the thermodynamic constraint of the slag cleaning process.},

ABSTRACT = {Three major components in a cathode of aqueous rechargeable lithium batteries are the active material, the polymer binder, and the carbon conductive additive. The stability of each component in the battery is the key to long service life. To evaluate the stability of the carbon component, we introduce here a quick and direct testing method. LiMn2O4 is chosen as a typical active material for the preparation of the cathode, with polyvinylidene fluoride (PVdF), and a commercial carbon, which is chosen among Acetylene black, superP, superP-Li, Ketjen black 1, Ketjen black 2, Graphite, KS-6, splintered glassy carbon, and splintered spherical carbon. This method reveals the correlation between the electrochemical stability of a carbon and its physical and structural properties. This helps researchers choose the right carbon component for a Li-ion cathode if they want the battery to be robust, especially at near full state of charge.},

ABSTRACT = {A hermetic dense polymer-carbon composite-based current collector foil (PCCF) for lithium-ion battery applications was developed and evaluated in comparison to state-of-the-art aluminum (Al) foil collector. Water-processed LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 (LMNO) cathode and Li4Ti5O12 (LTO) anode coatings with the integration of a thin carbon primer at the interface to the collector were prepared. Despite the fact that the laboratory manufactured PCCF shows a much higher film thickness of 55 µm compared to Al foil of 19 µm, the electrode resistance was measured to be by a factor of 5 lower compared to the Al collector, which was attributed to the low contact resistance between PCCF, carbon primer and electrode microstructure. The PCCF-C-primer collector shows a sufficient voltage stability up to 5 V vs. Li/Li+ and a negligible Li-intercalation loss into the carbon primer. Electrochemical cell tests demonstrate the applicability of the developed PCCF for LMNO and LTO electrodes, with no disadvantage compared to state-of-the-art Al collector. Due to a 50% lower material density, the lightweight and hermetic dense PCCF polymer collector offers the possibility to significantly decrease the mass loading of the collector in battery cells, which can be of special interest for bipolar battery architectures.},

ABSTRACT = {Although titanium dioxide has gained much attention as a sodium-ion battery anode material, obtaining high specific capacity and cycling stability remains a challenge. Herein, we report significantly improved surface chemistry and pseudocapacitive Na-ion storage performance of TiO2 nanosheet anode in vinylene carbonate (VC)-containing electrolyte solution. In addition to the excellent pseudocapacitance (~87%), the TiO2 anodes also exhibited increased high-specific capacity (219 mAh/g), rate performance (40 mAh/g @ 1 A/g), coulombic efficiency (~100%), and cycling stability (~90% after 750 cycles). Spectroscopic and microscopic studies confirmed polycarbonate based solid electrolyte interface (SEI) formation in VC-containing electrolyte solution. The superior electrochemical performance of the TiO2 nanosheet anode in VC-containing electrolyte solution is credited to the improved pseudocapacitive Na-ion diffusion through the polycarbonate based SEI (coefficients of 1.65 × 10−14 for PC-VC vs. 6.42 × 10−16 for PC). This study emphasizes the crucial role of the electrolyte solution and electrode–electrolyte interfaces in the improved pseudocapacitive Na-ion storage performance of TiO2 anodes.},

The evaluability of battery series connections using ICA is confirmed by analytical and experimental considerations for cells of the same SOH. For cells of different SOH, a method for identifying non-uniform aging states on the modules’ IC curve is presented.

By using specific charging procedures based on negative electrode performance, as opposed to the industrial standard constant current constant voltage procedures, we show that the cells with a higher N:P ratio can be charged to ~16% higher capacity in the ten-minute time frame. Cells with a higher N:P ratio also show similar cycle life performance to those with a conventional N:P ratio, despite the fact that these cells experience a much higher irreversible capacity loss, leading to a lower reversible specific capacity.},

Its crystal structure, chemical composition, and geometric/electronic structural information are investigated by X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD), microwave plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (MP-AES), and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). The electroactivity of TiHCF as a host for Li-ion and Na-ion batteries is studied in organic electrolytes. The results demonstrate that TiHCF is a good positive electrode material for both Li-ion and Na-ion batteries. Surprisingly, however, the material shows better electrochemical performance as a Na-ion host, offering a capacity of 74 mAh g−1 at C/20 and a 94.5% retention after 50 cycles. This is due to the activation of Ti towards the redox reaction, making TiHCF a good candidate electrode material for Na-ion batteries.},

ABSTRACT = {Internal short-circuit tests were carried out in a battery safety investigation chamber to determine the behavior of batteries during the nail penetration test. So far, systematic investigations regarding the test setup and its influence are rarely found in the literature. Especially, to improve the comparability of the multitude of available results, it is essential to understand the effects of the geometric, operating and ambient parameters. In this study commercial lithium ion batteries with a capacity of 5.3 and 3.3 Ah were used to study the influence of the varied parameters on the voltage drop, the development of surface temperatures and of infrared active gas species. We studied both the influence of the geometry of the penetrating nail and concentration of water in the inert atmosphere especially on the quantities of the reaction products under variation of cell capacity. It could be shown that the geometry of the nail, within certain limits, has no influence on the processes of the thermal runaway of high energy density lithium ion batteries (LIBs). However, a change in capacity from 5.3 to 3.3 Ah shows that in particular the gaseous reaction products differ: The standardized gas concentrations show a higher measurable concentration of all gases except CO for the 3.3 Ah LIBs. This circumstance can be explained by the intensity of the reactions due to the different battery capacities: In the 5.3 Ah cells a larger amount of unreacted material is immediately discharged from the reaction center, and by the different available amounts of oxidizing reaction partners. An increase of the water content in the surrounding atmosphere during the thermal runaway leads to a reduction of the measurable gas concentrations of up to 36.01%. In general, all measured concentrations decrease. With increased water content more reaction products from the atmosphere can be directly bound or settle as condensate on surfaces.},

ABSTRACT = {Accurately predicting battery behavior, while using low input data, is highly desirable in embedded simulation architectures like grid or integrated energy system analysis. Currently, the available vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB) models achieve highly accurate predictions of electrochemical behavior or control algorithms, while the optimization of the required input data scope is neglected. In this study, a parametrization tool for a DC grey box simulation model is developed using measurements with a 10 kW/100 kWh VRFB. An objective function is applied to optimize the required input data scope while analyzing simulation accuracy. The model is based on a differential-algebraic system, and an optimization process allows model parameter estimation and verification while reducing the input data scope. Current losses, theoretical storage capacity, open circuit voltage, and ohmic cell resistance are used as fitting parameters. Internal electrochemical phenomena are represented by a self-discharge current while material related losses are represented by a changing ohmic resistance. Upon reducing input data the deviation between the model and measurements shows an insignificant increase of 2% even for a 60% input data reduction. The developed grey box model is easily adaptable to other VRFB and is highly integrable into an existing energy architecture.},

ABSTRACT = {The cell characterization in the incoming inspection is an important but time and cost intensive process step. In order to obtain reliable parameters to evaluate and classify the cells, it is essential to design the test procedures in such a way that the parameters derived from the data allow the required statements about the cells. Before the focus is placed on the evaluation of cell properties, it is therefore necessary to design the test procedures appropriately. In the scope of the investigations two differently designed incoming inspection routines were carried out on 230 commercial lithium-ion battery cells (LIBs) with the aim of deriving recommendations for optimal test procedures. The derived parameters of the test strategies were compared and statistically evaluated. Subsequently, key figures for the classification were identified. As a conclusion, the capacity was confirmed as an already known important parameter and the average cell voltage was identified as a possibility to replace the usually used internal resistance. With regard to capacity, the integration of CV steps in the discharging processes enables the determination independently from the C-rate. For the average voltage cycles with high C-rates are particularly meaningful because of the significant higher scattering due to the overvoltage parts.},

ABSTRACT = {The battery energy storage system (BESS) is an indispensable part of an electric fleet (EF) which needs to be charged by electricity from local grid when the fleet is in the dockyard. The uncoordinated fast charging of BESS in Grid to Ferry (G2F) mode imposes sudden increments of load in the power grid, which is analyzed by a simulated model of grid connected marine load. The probable impact on system stability is examined by MATLAB Simulink and Power World Simulator based models. According to simulation results for IEEE 5 bus system, voltage unbalance factors are 0.01% and 200% for all buses at fundamental and third harmonics frequencies, respectively. The total harmonic distortion (THD) at fundamental frequency becomes 0.16%, 0.16%, and 0.18%, respectively, for three cases. The transient, voltage reactive power (V-Q), and voltage real power (V-P) sensitivity analysis are performed for 7 bus system with load increment contingencies. According to simulation results, the V-Q sensitivity for the assigned contingency is increased by the addition of a shunt generator to the load bus with lowest bus voltage. In case of V-P sensitivity for the selected contingency, the load buses share power among them, and the nose point is attained at maximum shift of power with high V-Q sensitivity.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper describes an approach to determine a fast-charging profile for a lithium-ion battery by utilising a simplified single-particle electrochemical model and direct collocation methods for optimal control. An optimal control problem formulation and a direct solution approach were adopted to address the problem effectively. The results shows that, in some cases, the optimal current profile resembles the current profile in the Constant Current–Constant Voltage charging protocol. Several challenges and knowledge gaps were addressed in this work, including a reformulation of the optimal control problem that utilises direct methods as an alternative to overcome the limitations of indirect methods employed in similar studies. The proposed formulation considers the minimum-time optimal control case, trade-offs between the total charging time, the maximisation of the lithium bulk concentration, and energy efficiency, along with inequality constraints and other factors not previously considered in the literature, which can be helpful in practical applications.},

ABSTRACT = {Lithium-ion batteries are widely used in mobile applications because they offer a suitable package of characteristics in terms of specific energy, cost, and life span. Nevertheless, they have the potential to experience thermal runaway (TR), the prevention and containment of which require safety measures and intensive thermal management. This study introduces a novel combined thermal management and safety application designed for large aspect-ratio battery cells such as pouches and thin prismatics. It comprises polymer-based mini-channel cold plates that can indirectly thermally condition the batteries’ faces with liquid. They are lightweight and space-saving, making them suitable for mobile systems. Furthermore, this study experimentally clarifies to which extent the application of polymer mini-channel cold plates between battery cells is suitable to delay TR by heat dissipation and to prevent thermal runaway propagation (TRP) to adjacent cells by simultaneously acting as a thermal barrier. NMC pouch cells of 12.5 Ah capacity were overcharged at 1 C to induce TR. Without cold plates, TR and TRP occurred within one hour. Utilizing the polymer mini-channel cold plates for face cooling, the overcharge did not produce a condition leading to cell fire in the same time frame. When the fluid inlet temperature was varied between 5 and 40 °C, the overcharged cell’s surface temperature peaked between 50 and 60 °C. Indications were found that thermal conditioning with the polymer cold plates significantly slowed down parts of the process chain before cell firing. Their peak performance was measured to be just under 2.2 kW/m2. In addition, thermal management system malfunction was tested, and evidence was found that the polymer cold plates prevented TRP to adjacent cells. In conclusion, a combined thermal management and safety system made of polymer mini-channel cold plates provides necessary TR-related safety aspects in lithium battery systems and should be further investigated.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper provides a comprehensive exploration of float current analysis in lithium-ion batteries, a promising new testing method to assess calendar aging. Float currents are defined as the steady-state trickle charge current after a transient part. In the literature, a correlation to capacity loss was reported. Assuming the float current compensates for the voltage decay over time and is linked to calendar aging, effects from voltage slippery must be considered. The dU/dQ analysis suggests solely a loss of active lithium. Therefore, we investigate the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) growth as the general aging mechanism to explain the origin of float currents. Our results show that the voltage slippery theory holds true within the low to middle test voltage ranges. However, the theory’s explanatory power begins to diminish at higher voltage ranges, suggesting the existence of additional, yet unidentified, factors influencing the float current. A shuttle reaction or lithiation of the cathode by electrolyte decomposition are the most promising alternative aging mechanisms at high voltages. The paper proposes a unique voltage slippery model to check for correlations between aging mechanisms, the float current test and the check-up test. For a better understanding, test strategies are proposed to verify/falsify the aging mechanisms beyond SEI.},

ABSTRACT = {As an important element of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), the separator plays a critical role in the safety and comprehensive performance of the battery. Electrospun nanofiber separators have a high porosity and good electrolyte affinity, which are favorable to the transference of lithium ions. In this paper, the batch preparation of polyacrylonitrile (PAN)-based nanofiber separators are obtained via spherical section free surface electrospinning (SSFSE). Introducing an appropriate amount of polyester polyurethane (PU) can effectively enhance the mechanical property of PAN nanofiber separators and help the separators resist the external force extrusion. The results show that when PAN:PU = 8:2, the porosity and electrolyte uptake rate of the composite nanofiber separator (PAN-2) are 62.9% and 643.3%, respectively, exhibiting a high ionic conductivity (1.90 mS/cm). Additionally, the coin battery assembled with PAN-2 as a separator (LiFePO4/PAN-2/lithium metal) shows good cycling performance and good rate performance, with a capacity retention rate of 93.9% after 100 cycles at 0.5 C, indicating that the battery with PAN-2 has a good application potential in advanced energy storage.},

ABSTRACT = {Supercapacitors are extensively used in urban rail transit, electric vehicles, renewable energy storage, electronic products, and the military industry due to its long cycle life and high power density. Porous carbon materials are regarded as promising anode materials for supercapacitors due to their high specific surface areas and well-developed pore structures. However, the over-developed pore structure often results in poor conductivity and reduced cycle stability due to the destruction of a carbon skeleton. Herein, we introduce an advanced strategy for preparing porous carbon with high specific surface areas (3333 m2 g−1), high electrical conductivity (68.6 S m−1), and fast ion transport channels through secondary high-temperature carbonization treatment. As a result, the fabricated porous carbon anode delivers a high specific capacitance (199.2 F g−1 at 1 A g−1) and outstanding rate performance (136.3 F g−1 at 20 A g−1) in organic electrolyte. Furthermore, the assembled symmetrical supercapacitor achieves an energy density of 43.2 Wh kg−1 at 625.0 W kg−1, highlighting the potential of a secondary high-temperature carbonization strategy in practical applications.},

ABSTRACT = {The increasing global warming problem has pushed the community to implement emission reduction measures in almost every segment of human life. Since the major source of anthropogenic Greenhouse Gases (GHGs) is fossil fuel combustion, in the shipping sector, these measures are oriented toward a reduction in tailpipe emissions, where the replacement of traditional internal combustion marine engines with zero-carbon technologies offers the ultimate emission reduction results. According to the International Maritime Organization (IMO) GHG strategy, vessels involved in international shipping must achieve a minimum 50% reduction in their GHG emissions by 2050. However, this requirement does not extend to fishing vessels, which are significant consumers of fossil fuels. This paper deals with the full electrification of two types of fishing vessels (purse seiners and trawlers), wherein different Lithium-ion Batteries (LiBs) are considered. To investigate their environmental footprint and profitability, Life-Cycle Assessments (LCAs) and Life-Cycle Cost Assessments (LCCAs) are performed. The comparison of all-electric fishing vessels with existing diesel-powered ships highlighted the Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP) battery as the most suitable alternative powering option regarding environmental and economic criteria.},

ABSTRACT = {Vanadium redox-flow batteries (VRFBs) have played a significant role in hybrid energy storage systems (HESSs) over the last few decades owing to their unique characteristics and advantages. Hence, the accurate estimation of the VRFB model holds significant importance in large-scale storage applications, as they are indispensable for incorporating the distinctive features of energy storage systems and control algorithms within embedded energy architectures. In this work, we propose a novel approach that combines model-based and data-driven techniques to predict battery state variables, i.e., the state of charge (SoC), voltage, and current. Our proposal leverages enhanced deep reinforcement learning techniques, specifically deep q-learning (DQN), by combining q-learning with neural networks to optimize the VRFB-specific parameters, ensuring a robust fit between the real and simulated data. Our proposed method outperforms the existing approach in voltage prediction. Subsequently, we enhance the proposed approach by incorporating a second deep RL algorithm—dueling DQN—which is an improvement of DQN, resulting in a 10% improvement in the results, especially in terms of voltage prediction. The proposed approach results in an accurate VFRB model that can be generalized to several types of redox-flow batteries.},

ABSTRACT = {Lithium-ion batteries are key elements in the development of electrical energy storage solutions. However, due to cycling, environmental, and operating conditions, battery capacity tends to degrade over time. Capacity fade is a common indicator of battery state of health (SOH) because it is an indication of how the capacity has been degraded. However, battery capacity cannot be measured directly, and thus, there is an urgent need to develop methods for estimating battery capacity in real time. By analyzing the historical data of a battery in detail, it is possible to predict the future state of a battery and forecast its remaining useful life. This study developed a real-time, simple, and fast method to estimate the cycle capacity of a battery during the charge cycle using only data from a short period of each charge cycle. This proposal is attractive because it does not require data from the entire charge period since batteries are rarely charged from zero to full. The proposed method allows for simultaneous and accurate real-time prediction of the health and remaining useful life of the battery over its lifetime. The accuracy of the proposed method was tested using experimental data from several lithium-ion batteries with different cathode chemistries under various test conditions.},

ABSTRACT = {Non-aqueous redox flow batteries (NARFBs) have been attracting much attention because they can significantly increase power and energy density compared to conventional RFBs. In this study, novel pore-filled anion-exchange membranes (PFAEMs) for application to a NAPFB employing metal polypyridyl complexes (i.e., Fe(bpy)32+/Fe(bpy)33+ and Co(bpy)32+/Co(bpy)33+) as the redox species are successfully developed. A porous polyethylene support with excellent solvent resistance and mechanical strength is used for membrane fabrication. The PFAEMs are prepared by filling an ionic liquid monomer containing an imidazolium group and a crosslinking agent into the pores of the support film and then performing in situ photopolymerization. As a result, the prepared membranes exhibit excellent mechanical strength and stability in a non-aqueous medium as well as high ion conductivity. In addition, a low crossover rate for redox ion species is observed for the prepared membranes because they have relatively low swelling characteristics in non-aqueous electrolyte solutions and low affinity for the metal-complex redox species compared to a commercial membrane. Consequently, the PFAEM is revealed to possess superior battery performance than a commercial membrane in the NARFB tests, showing high energy efficiency of about 85% and stable operation for 100 cycles.},

ABSTRACT = {Li-ion batteries (LIBs) represent the most sophisticated electrochemical energy storage technology. Nevertheless, they still suffer from safety issues and practical drawbacks related to the use of toxic and flammable liquid electrolytes. Thus, polymer-based solid electrolytes may be a suitable option to fulfill the safety and energy density requirements, even though the lack of high ionic conductivity at 25 °C (10−8–10−7 S cm−1) hinders their performance. To overcome these drawbacks, herein, we present an all-solid-state Li-metal full cell based on a three-component solid poly(ethylene oxide)/lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide/titanium dioxide composite electrolyte that outclasses the conventional poly(ethylene oxide)-based solid electrolytes. Moreover, the cell features are enhanced by the combination of the solid electrolyte with a self-standing LiFePO4 catholyte fabricated through an innovative, simple and easily scalable approach. The structural, morphological and compositional properties of this system are characterized, and the results show that the electrochemical performance of the solid composite electrolyte can be considerably improved by tuning the concentration and morphology of TiO2. Additionally, tests performed with the self-standing LiFePO4 catholyte underline a good cyclability of the system, thus confirming the beneficial effects provided by the novel manufacturing path used for the preparation of self-standing electrodes.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper presents operation and control systems for a new modular on-board charger (OBC) based on a SEPIC converter (MSOBC) for electric vehicle (EV) applications. The MSOBC aims to modularise the battery units in the energy storage system of the EV to provide better safety and improved operation. This is mainly achieved by reducing the voltage of the battery packs without sacrificing the performance required by the HV system. The proposed MSOBC is an integrated OBC which can operate the EV during traction and braking, as well as charge the battery units. The MSOBC is composed of several submodules consisting of a full-bridge voltage source converter connected on the ac side and SEPIC converter installed on the battery side. The SEPIC converter controls the battery segments with a continuous current because it has an input inductor which can smooth the battery’s currents without the need for large electrolytic capacitors. The isolated version of the SEPIC converter is employed to enhance the system’s safety by providing galvanic isolation between the batteries and the ac output side. This paper presents the necessary control loops to ensure the optimal operation of the EV with the MSOBC in terms of charge and temperature balance without disturbing the required modes of operation. The mathematical analyses in this paper are validated using a full-scale EV controlled by TMS320F28335 DSP.},

ABSTRACT = {The integration of renewable resources in isolated systems can produce instability in the electrical grid due to its intermintency. In today’s microgrids, which lack synchronous generation, physical inertia is substituted for inertia emulation. To date, the most effective approach remains the frequency derivative control technique. Nevertheless, within this method, the ability to provide virtual drooping is often disregarded in its design, potentially leading to inadequate development in systems featuring high renewable penetration and low damping. To address this issue, this paper introduces an innovative design and analysis of virtual inertia control to simultaneously mimic droop and inertia characteristics in microgrids. The dynamic frequency response without and with renewable energy sources penetration is comparatively analyzed by simulation. The proposed virtual inertia control employs a derivative technique to measure the rate of change of frequency slope during inertia emulation. Sensitivity mapping is conducted to scrutinize its impact on dynamic frequency response. Finally, the physical battery storage system of the University of Cuenca microgrid is used as a case study under operating conditions.},

ABSTRACT = {Predicting the core temperature of a Li-ion battery is crucial for precise state estimation, but it is difficult to directly measure. Existing quick temperature-predicting approaches can hardly consider the thermal mass of complex structure that may cause time delays, particularly under high C-rate dynamic conditions. In this paper, we developed a quick temperature prediction algorithm based on a thermal convolution method (TCM) to calculate the core temperature of a flat heat pipe-based battery thermal management system (FHP-BTMS) under dynamic conditions. The model could predict the core temperature rapidly through convolution of the thermal response map which contains full physical information. Firstly, in order to obtain a high fidelity spatio-temporal temperature distribution, the thermal capacitance-resistance network (TCRN) of the FHP-BTMS is established and validated by constant and dynamic discharging experiments. Then, the response map of the core temperature motivated by various impulse heat sources and heat sinks is obtained. Specifically, the dynamic thermal characteristics of an FHP are discussed to correct the boundary conditions of the TCM. Afterwards, the temperature prediction performances of the TCM and a lumped model under different step operating conditions are compared. The TCM results show a 70–80% accuracy improvement and better dynamic adaptivity than the lumped model. Lastly, a vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) profile is employed. The temperature prediction accuracy results show that the TCM can maintain a relative error below 5% throughout the entire prediction period.},

ABSTRACT = {Macro-scale mechanical testing and finite element analysis of lithium metal in compression have been shown to suggest methods and parameters for producing thin lithium anodes. Consideration of engineering and geometrically corrected stress experiments shows that the increasing contact area dominates the stress increase observed during the compression, not strain hardening, of lithium. Under static loading, the lithium metal stress relaxes, which means there is a speed of deformation (engineering strainrate limit of 6.4×10−5 s−1) where there is no increase in stress during compression. Constant displacement tests show that stress relaxation depends on the initial applied stress and the amount of athermal plastic work within the material. The finite element analysis shows that barrelling during compression and the requirement for high applied stresses to compress lithium with a small height-to-width ratio are friction and geometric effects, respectively. The outcomes of this work are discussed in relation to the diminishing returns of stack pressure, the difficulty in closing voids, and potential methods for designing and producing sub-micron lithium anodes.},

ABSTRACT = {Over the past years, lithium-ion solid-state batteries have demonstrated significant advancements regarding such properties as safety, long-term endurance, and energy density. Solid-state electrolytes based on lithium halides offer new opportunities due to their unique features such as a broad electrochemical stability window, high lithium-ion conductivity, and elasticity at close to melting point temperatures that could enhance lithium-ion transport at interfaces. A comparative study of lithium indium halide (Li3InCl6) electrolytes synthesized through a mechano-thermal method with varying optimization parameters revealed a significant effect of temperature and pressure on lithium-ion transport. An analysis of Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) data within the temperature range of 25–100 °C revealed that the optimized Li3InCl6 electrolyte reveals high ionic conductivity, reaching 1.0 mS cm−1 at room temperature. Herein, we present the utilization of in situ/operando X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) and in situ X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) to investigate the temperature-dependent behavior of the Li3InCl6 electrolyte. Confirmed by these methods, significant changes in the Li3InCl6 ionic conductivity at 70 °C were observed due to phase transformation. The observed behavior provides critical information for practical applications of the Li3InCl6 solid-state electrolyte in a broad temperature range, contributing to the enhancement of lithium-ion solid-state batteries through their improved morphology, chemical interactions, and structural integrity.},

ABSTRACT = {This article explores the novel application of a trained artificial neural network (ANN) in the prediction of vanadium redox flow battery behaviour and compares its performance with that of a two-dimensional numerical model. The aim is to evaluate the capability of two ANNs, one for predicting the cell potential and one for the overpotential under various operating conditions. The two-dimensional model, previously validated with experimental data, was used to generate data to train and test the ANNs. The results show that the first ANN precisely predicts the cell voltage under different states of charge and current density conditions in both the charge and discharge modes. The second ANN, which is responsible for the overpotential calculation, can accurately predict the overpotential across the cell domains, with the lowest confidence near high-gradient areas such as the electrode membrane and domain boundaries. Furthermore, the computational time is substantially reduced, making ANNs a suitable option for the fast understanding and optimisation of VRFBs.},

ABSTRACT = {Recently, potassium-ion batteries (KIBs) have attracted significant interest due to a number of factors, including the growing demand for energy and limited lithium resources. However, their practical use is hampered by poor cycling stability due to the large size of K+. Therefore, it is critical to develop a structural design that effectively suppresses large volume changes. This study presents a simple method of using a salt template to fabricate porous microspheres (p-MoSe2@C MS) of MoSe2 and a carbon matrix as anode materials in KIBs. These microspheres have a distinct porous design, with uniformly distributed MoSe2 nanocrystals embedded in the carbon matrix to prevent MoSe2 overgrowth due to material diffusion during heat treatment. The manufacturing process combined one-step spray drying with recyclable NaCl as a hard template. Through a two-step thermal process under an inert atmosphere, the initial dextrin, NaCl, and Mo salt microspheres were converted into a p-MoSe2@N MS composite. The carbon structure derived from the dextrin maintained the shape of the microspheres when NaCl was removed, ensuring no overgrowth of MoSe2. This well-designed porous structure improves the interaction with the electrolyte, facilitating the transport of ions and electrons and reducing the K+ diffusion distances. In addition, the porous carbon structure accommodates large volume changes during cycling and maintains its structural strength. As a result, p-MoSe2@C MS composite exhibits superior electrochemical properties, with remarkable capacity, long-term cycling stability (193 mA h g−1 after 500 cycles at 2.0 A g−1), and rate capability.},

ABSTRACT = {The health assessment of lithium-ion batteries holds great research significance in various areas such as battery management systems, battery usage and maintenance, and battery economic evaluation. However, because environmental perturbations are not taken into account during the assessment, the accuracy and reliability of the assessment are limited. Thus, a health assessment model for lithium-ion batteries based on evidence reasoning rules with dynamic reference value (ER-DRV) is proposed in this paper. Firstly, considering that the data are subject to changes, dynamic reference values, real-time weights, and real-time reliability were utilized in the model to ensure the effectiveness and accuracy of the assessment. Moreover, an enhanced optimization method based on the whale optimization algorithm (WOA) was developed to improve the accuracy of the assessment model. In addition, the robustness of the ER-DRV model was studied with perturbation analysis methods. Finally, the proposed method was validated on two open lithium-ion battery datasets. The experimental results show that the health assessment method proposed in this article not only has higher accuracy and transparent reasoning process but also has strong robustness and good generalization ability.},

ABSTRACT = {Rapid technological changes and disruptive innovations have resulted in a significant shift in people’s behavior and requirements. Electronic gadgets, including smartphones, notebooks, and other devices, are indispensable to everyday routines. Consequently, the demand for high-capacity batteries has surged, which has enabled extended device autonomy. An alternative approach to address this demand is battery swapping, which can potentially extend the battery life of electronic devices. Although battery sharing in electric vehicles has been well studied, smartphone applications still need to be explored. Crucially, assessing the batteries’ state of health (SoH) presents a challenge, necessitating consensus on the best estimation methods to develop effective battery swap strategies. This paper proposes a model for estimating the SoH curve of lithium-ion batteries using the state of charge curve. The model was designed for smartphone battery swap applications utilizing Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) neural networks. To validate the model, a system was developed to conduct destructive tests on batteries and study their behavior over their lifetimes. The results demonstrated the high precision of the model in estimating the SoH of batteries under various charge and discharge parameters. The proposed approach exhibits low computational complexity, low cost, and easily measurable input parameters, making it an attractive solution for smartphone battery swap applications.},

ABSTRACT = {Effectively extracting a lithium-ion battery’s impedance is of great importance for various onboard applications, which requires consideration of both the time consumption and accuracy of the measurement process. Although the pseudorandom binary sequence (PRBS) excitation signal can inject the superposition frequencies with high time efficiency and an easily implementable device, processing the data of the battery’s impedance measurement is still a challenge at present. This study proposes a fast impedance spectrum construction method for lithium-ion batteries, where a multi-density clustering algorithm was designed to effectively extract the useful impedance after PRBS injection. According to the distribution properties of the measurement points by PRBS, a density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) was used for processing the data of the lithium-ion battery’s impedance. The two key parameters of the DBSCAN were adjusted by a delicate workflow according to the frequency range. The validation of the proposed method was proved on a 3 Ah lithium-ion battery under nine different test conditions, considering both the SOC and temperature variations.},

ABSTRACT = {As electric vehicles (EVs) gain market dominance, ensuring safety during the battery usage is crucial. This paper presents a new thermal management approach to address the battery heat accumulation challenge through a novel combination of composite phase change material (CPCM) with liquid cooling systems. An optimised hybrid cooling model is developed to evaluate the proposed battery thermal management system (BTMS) under high-temperature and high-power conditions. Benchmark studies are conducted to assess the impact of inlet position, inlet flow rate, and flow channel distribution on the cooling performance to achieve a uniform temperature distribution within the battery. The optimised BTMS, consisting of a five-cell battery pack, demonstrates a maximum temperature of 41.15 °C and a temperature difference of 4.89 °C in a operating condition at 36 °C with a discharge rate of 3 C. The BTMS outperforms the initial model, reducing the maximum temperature by 1.5%, temperature difference by 5%, and liquid fraction by 13%, with a slight (1.3%) increase in weight. The cooling performance is most efficient at a liquid flow rate of 0.1 m/s, minimising energy consumption. The proposed BTMS with CPCM-3 is also sufficient enough to keep the battery pack under a thermal runaway event. Overall, the theoretical simulation highlights the BTMS’s ability to effectively control battery temperatures and temperature differences, ensuring safe operation during high-temperature and high-power conditions in practical EV usage.},
