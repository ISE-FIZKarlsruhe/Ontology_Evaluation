ABSTRACT = {Hybrid composite laminates including carbon fibers and natural fibers, hence basalt and/or vegetable ones, draw on the experiences accumulated in studying the hybridization of fiberglass with carbon or natural fibers. Yet, in the case of carbon/natural fiber composites, the sense is different: in particular, the idea is to accept the reduction of properties from bare carbon fiber composites and the unavoidable complication in processing, induced by hybridization. The compensation obtained, which offers a rationale to this operation, is the improved toughness and a significant modification of the different modes of failure. This would bring a higher energy absorption and a substantially more effective damage tolerance. The aforementioned characteristics are particularly of interest in the case of flexural properties, impact properties, and residual post-impact performance.},

ABSTRACT = {Triple-layered composite plates are created by joining three composite layers using shear connectors. These layers, which are assumed to be always in contact and able to move relatively to each other during deformation, could be the same or different in geometric dimensions and material. They are applied in various engineering fields such as ship-building, aircraft wing manufacturing, etc. However, there are only a few publications regarding the calculation of this kind of plate. This paper proposes novel equations, which utilize Mindlin’s theory and finite element modelling to simulate the forced vibration of triple-layered composite plates with layers connected by shear connectors subjected to a moving load. Moreover, a Matlab computation program is introduced to verify the reliability of the proposed equations, as well as the influence of some parameters, such as boundary conditions, the rigidity of the shear connector, thickness-to-length ratio, and the moving load velocity on the dynamic response of the composite plate.},

ABSTRACT = {The performance characterization of the manufacturing processes for additive manufacturing (AM) systems is a significant task for their standardization and implementation in the industry. Also, there is a large diversity of materials used in different AM processes. In the present paper, a methodology is proposed to evaluate, in different directions, the performance of an AM process and material characterization in terms of surface quality. This methodology consists of eight steps, based on a new surface inspection artifact and basic artifact orientations. The proposed artifact with several design configurations fits different AM systems sizes and meets the needs of customers. The effects of main factors on the surface roughness of up-facing platens of the artifacts are investigated using the statistical design of experiments. The proposed methodology is validated by a case study focused on PolyJet material jetting technology. Samples are manufactured of photopolymer resins and post-processed. Three factors (i.e., artifact orientation, platen orientation, and finish type) are considered for the investigation. The case study results show that the platen orientation, finish type, and their interaction have a significant influence on the surface roughness (Ra). The best Ra roughness results were obtained for the glossy finish type in the range of 0.5–4 μm.},

ABSTRACT = {The effect of the Ni/Si mass ratio and combined thermomechanical treatment on the microstructure and properties of ternary Cu-Ni-Si alloys is discussed systematically. The Cu-Ni-Si alloy with a Ni/Si mass ratio of 4–5 showed good comprehensive properties. Precipitates with disc-like shapes were confirmed as the Ni2Si phase with orthorhombic structure through transmission electron microscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, and 3D atom probe characterization. After the appropriate thermomechanical treatment, the studied alloy with a Ni/Si mass ratio of 4.2 exhibited excellent mechanical properties: a hardness of 290 HV, tensile strength of 855 MPa, yield strength of 782 MPa, and elongation of 4.5%. Compared with other approaches, the thermomechanical treatment increased the hardness and strength without sacrificing electrical conductivity. Theoretical calculations indicated that the high strength was primarily attributed to the Orowan precipitation strengthening and secondarily ascribed to the work hardening, which were highly consistent with the experimental results. The appropriate Ni/Si mass ratio with a low content of Ni and Si atoms shows high strength and excellent electrical conductivity through combined thermomechanical treatment. This work provides a guideline for the design and preparation of multicomponent Cu-Ni-Si-X alloys with ultrahigh strength and excellent electrical conductivity.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, a 2-node beam element is developed based on Quasi-3D beam theory and mixed formulation for static bending of functionally graded (FG) beams. The transverse shear strains and stresses of the proposed beam element are parabolic distributions through the thickness of the beam and the transverse shear stresses on the top and bottom surfaces of the beam vanish. The proposed beam element is free of shear-looking without selective or reduced integration. The material properties of the functionally graded beam are assumed to vary according to the power-law index of the volume fraction of the constituents through the thickness of the beam. The numerical results of this study are compared with published results to illustrate the accuracy and convenience rate of the new beam element. The influence of some parametrics on the bending behavior of FGM beams is investigated.},

ABSTRACT = {Coal contains a large number of fractures, whose characteristics are difficult to describe in detail, while their spatial distribution patterns may follow some macroscopic statistical laws. In this paper, several fracture geometric parameters (FGPs) were used to describe a fracture, and the coal seam was represented by a two-dimensional stochastic fracture network (SFN) which was generated and processed through a series of methods in MATLAB. Then, the processed SFN image was able to be imported into COMSOL Multiphysics and converted to a computational domain through the image function. In this way, the influences of different FGPs and their distribution patterns on the permeability of the coal seam were studied, and a finite element model to investigate gas flow properties in the coal seam was carried out. The results show that the permeability of the coal seam increased with the rising of fracture density, length, aperture, and with the decrease of the angle between the fracture orientation and the gas pressure gradient. It has also been found that large-sized fractures have a more significant contribution to coal reservoir permeability. Additionally, a numerical simulation of CBM extraction was carried out to show the potential of the proposed approach in the application of tackling practical engineering problems. According to the results, not only the connectivity of fractures but also variations of gas pressure and velocity can be displayed explicitly, which is consistent well with the actual situation.},

ABSTRACT = {Metal additive manufacturing can produce geometrically complex parts with effective cost. The high thermal gradients due to the repeatedly rapid heat and solidification cause defects in the produced parts, such as cracks, porosity, undesired residual stress, and part distortion. Different techniques were employed for temperature investigation. Experimental measurement and finite element method-based numerical models are limited by the restricted accessibility and expensive computational cost, respectively. The available physics-based analytical model has promising short computational efficiency without resorting to finite element method or any iteration-based simulations. However, the heat transfer boundary condition cannot be considered without the involvement of finite element method or iteration-based simulations, which significantly reduces the computational efficiency, and thus the usefulness of the developed model. This work presents an explicit and closed-form solution, namely heat sink solution, to consider the heat transfer boundary condition. The heat sink solution was developed from the moving point heat source solution based on heat transfer of convection and radiation. The part boundary is mathematically discretized into many heats sinks due to the non-uniform temperature distribution, which causes non-uniform heat loss. The temperature profiles, thermal gradients, and temperature-affected material properties are calculated and presented. Good agreements were observed upon validation against experimental molten pool measurements.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper presents a radar cross-section (RCS) reduction technique by using the coding diffusion metasurface, which is optimised through a random optimization algorithm. The design consists of two unit cells, which are elements ‘1’ and ‘0’. The reflection phase between the two-unit cells has a 180° ± 37° phase difference. It has a working frequency band from 8.6 GHz to 22.5 GHz, with more than 9 dB RCS reduction. The monostatic RCS reduction has a wider bandwidth of coding diffusion metasurface as compared to the traditional chessboard metasurface. In addition, the bistatic performance of the designed metasurfaces is observed at 15.4 GHz, which shows obvious RCS reduction when compared to a metallic plate of the same size. The simulated and measured result shows the proficiency of the designed metasurface.},

ABSTRACT = {The penetration enhancement behaviors of a reactive material double-layered liner (RM-DLL) shaped charge against thick steel targets are investigated. The RM-DLL comprises an inner copper liner, coupled with an outer PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene)/Al reactive material liner, fabricated via a cold pressing/sintering process. This RM-DLL shaped charge presents a novel defeat mechanism that incorporates the penetration capability of a precursor copper jet and the chemical energy release of a follow-thru reactive material penetrator. Experimental results showed that, compared with the single reactive liner shaped charge jet, a deeper penetration depth was produced by the reactive material-copper jet, whereas the penetration performance and reactive material mass entering the penetrated target strongly depended on the reactive liner thickness and standoff. To further illustrate the penetration enhancement mechanism, numerical simulations based on AUTODYN-2D code were conducted. Numerical results indicated that, with increasing reactive liner thickness, the initiation delay time of the reactive materials increased significantly, which caused the penetration depth and the follow-thru reactive material mass to increase for a given standoff. This new RM-DLL shaped charge configuration provides an extremely efficient method to enhance the penetration damage to various potential targets, such as armored fighting vehicles, naval vessels, and concrete targets.},

ABSTRACT = {We have calculated that with the world population projected to increase from 7.5 billion in 2017 to 9.8 in 2050, the next generation (within 33 years) will produce 12,000–13,000 Mt of plastic, and that the yearly consumption will reach 37–40 kilos of plastic per person worldwide. One of the branches of the plastics industry is the production of plastics for agriculture e.g., seed trays and pots. In this paper, novel metakaolin-based geopolymer composites reinforced with cellulosic fibres are presented as an alternative to plastic pots. Materials can be dedicated to agricultural applications, provided they have neutral properties, however, geopolymer paste and its final products have high pH. Therefore, a two-step protocol of neutralisation of the geopolymer foam pots was optimised and implemented. The strength of the geopolymer samples was lower when foams were neutralised. The reinforcement of geopolymers with cellulose clearly prevented the reduction of mechanical properties after neutralisation, which was correlated with the lower volume of pores in the foam and with the cellulose chemical properties. Both, neutralisation and reinforcement with cellulose can also eliminate an efflorescence. Significantly increased plant growth was found in geopolymer pots in comparison to plastic pots. The cellulose in geopolymers resulted in better adsorption and slower desorption of minerals during fertilisation. This effect could also be associated with a lower number of large pores in the presence of cellulose fibres in pots, and thus more stable pore filling and better protection of internal surface interactions.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper investigates the progressive damage and failure behavior of unidirectional graphite fiber-reinforced aluminum composites (CF/Al composites) under transverse and longitudinal tensile loadings. Micromechanical finite element analyses are carried out using different assumptions regarding fiber, matrix alloy, and interface properties. The validity of these numerical analyses is examined by comparing the predicted stress-strain curves with the experimental data measured under transverse and longitudinal tensile loadings. Assuming a perfect interface, the transverse tensile strength is overestimated by more than 180% and the transverse fracture induced by fiber failure is unrealistic based on the experimental observations. In fact, the simulation and experiment results indicate that the interface debonding arising from the matrix alloy failure dominates the transverse fracture, and the influence of matrix alloy properties on the mechanical behavior is inconspicuous. In the case of longitudinal tensile testing, however, the characteristic of interface bonding has no significant effect on the macroscopic mechanical response due to the low in-situ strength of the fibers. It is demonstrated that ultimate longitudinal fracture is mainly controlled by fiber failure mechanisms, which is confirmed by the fracture morphology of the tensile samples.},

It was found that the PSO-BP neural network model was superior to the simple ANNs that were trained by a single algorithm and it is suitable for predicting the CS of GGBFS concrete.},

ABSTRACT = {Compressive strength is considered as one of the most important parameters in concrete design. Time and cost can be reduced if the compressive strength of concrete is accurately estimated. In this paper, a new prediction model for compressive strength of high-performance concrete (HPC) was developed using a non-tuned machine learning technique, namely, a regularized extreme learning machine (RELM). The RELM prediction model was developed using a comprehensive dataset obtained from previously published studies. The input variables of the model include cement, blast furnace slag, fly ash, water, superplasticizer, coarse aggregate, fine aggregate, and age of specimens. k-fold cross-validation was used to assess the prediction reliability of the developed RELM model. The prediction results of the RELM model were evaluated using various error measures and compared with that of the standard extreme learning machine (ELM) and other methods presented in the literature. The findings of this research indicate that the compressive strength of HPC can be accurately estimated using the proposed RELM model.},

ABSTRACT = {Concrete filled steel tubes (CFSTs) show advantageous applications in the field of construction, especially for a high axial load capacity. The challenge in using such structure lies in the selection of many parameters constituting CFST, which necessitates defining complex relationships between the components and the corresponding properties. The axial capacity (Pu) of CFST is among the most important mechanical properties. In this study, the possibility of using a feedforward neural network (FNN) to predict Pu was investigated. Furthermore, an evolutionary optimization algorithm, namely invasive weed optimization (IWO), was used for tuning and optimizing the FNN weights and biases to construct a hybrid FNN–IWO model and improve its prediction performance. The results showed that the FNN–IWO algorithm is an excellent predictor of Pu, with a value of R2 of up to 0.979. The advantage of FNN–IWO was also pointed out with the gains in accuracy of 47.9%, 49.2%, and 6.5% for root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and R2, respectively, compared with simulation using the single FNN. Finally, the performance in predicting the Pu in the function of structural parameters such as depth/width ratio, thickness of steel tube, yield stress of steel, concrete compressive strength, and slenderness ratio was investigated and discussed.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, the main objectives are to investigate and select the most suitable parameters used in particle swarm optimization (PSO), namely the number of rules (nrule), population size (npop), initial weight (wini), personal learning coefficient (c1), global learning coefficient (c2), and velocity limits (fv), in order to improve the performance of the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system in determining the buckling capacity of circular opening steel beams. This is an important mechanical property in terms of the safety of structures under subjected loads. An available database of 3645 data samples was used for generation of training (70%) and testing (30%) datasets. Monte Carlo simulations, which are natural variability generators, were used in the training phase of the algorithm. Various statistical measurements, such as root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), Willmott’s index of agreement (IA), and Pearson’s coefficient of correlation (R), were used to evaluate the performance of the models. The results of the study show that the performance of ANFIS optimized by PSO (ANFIS-PSO) is suitable for determining the buckling capacity of circular opening steel beams, but is very sensitive under different PSO investigation and selection parameters. The findings of this study show that nrule = 10, npop = 50, wini = 0.1 to 0.4, c1 = [1, 1.4], c2 = [1.8, 2], fv = 0.1, which are the most suitable selection values to ensure the best performance for ANFIS-PSO. In short, this study might help in selection of suitable PSO parameters for optimization of the ANFIS model.},

ABSTRACT = {The rapid growth of Additive Manufacturing (AM) in the past decade has demonstrated a significant potential in cost-effective production with a superior quality product. A numerical simulation is a steep way to learn and improve the product quality, life cycle, and production cost. To cope with the growing AM field, researchers are exploring different techniques, methods, models to simulate the AM process efficiently. The goal is to develop a thermo-mechanical weld model for the Directed Energy Deposition (DED) process for 316L stainless steel at an efficient computational cost targeting to model large AM parts in residual stress calculation. To adapt the weld model to the DED simulation, single and multi-track thermal simulations were carried out. Numerical results were validated by the DED experiment. A good agreement was found between predicted temperature trends for numerical simulation and experimental results. A large number of weld tracks in the 3D solid AM parts make the finite element process simulation challenging in terms of computational time and large amounts of data management. The method of activating elements layer by layer and introducing heat in a cyclic manner called a thermal cycle heat input was applied. Thermal cycle heat input reduces the computational time considerably. The numerical results were compared to the experimental data for thermal and residual stress analyses. A lumping of layers strategy was implemented to reduce further computational time. The different number of lumping layers was analyzed to define the limit of lumping to retain accuracy in the residual stress calculation. The lumped layers residual stress calculation was validated by the contour cut method in the deposited sample. Thermal behavior and residual stress prediction for the different numbers of a lumped layer were examined and reported computational time reduction.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper reviews the current achievements regarding the rheological behavior of polymer-based nanocomposites containing carbon nanotubes (CNTs). These systems have been the subject of a very large number of scientific investigations in the last decades, due to the outstanding characteristics of CNTs that have allowed the formulation of nanostructured polymer-based materials with superior properties. However, the exploitation of the theoretical nanocomposite properties is strictly dependent on the complete dispersion of CNTs within the host matrix and on the consequent development of a huge interfacial region. In this context, a deep knowledge of the rheological behavior of CNT-containing systems is of fundamental importance, since the evaluation of the material’s viscoelastic properties allows the gaining of fundamental information as far as the microstructure of nanofilled polymers is concerned. More specifically, the understanding of the rheological response of polymer/CNT nanocomposites reveals important details about the characteristics of the interface and the extent of interaction between the two components, hence allowing the optimization of the final properties in the resulting nanocomposites. As the literature contains plenty of reviews concerning the rheological behavior of polymer/CNT nanocomposites, this review paper will summarize the most significant thermoplastic matrices in terms of availability and relevant industrial applications.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, the effects of different hydrophobic coatings on the surface of covered electrodes on the quality of wet welded carbon steel joints were discussed. Commonly available hydrophobic substances used in industrial applications were selected for the research.

During experiments diffusible hydrogen content in deposited metal determination by mercury method, metallographic macro- and microscopic testing and hardness measurements were performed. Investigations showed that waterproof coatings laid on covered electrodes can improve the quality of wet welded joints, by decreasing the Vickers HV10 hardness in heat-affected zone and decreasing the diffusible hydrogen content in deposited metal, which minimalize possibility of cold cracking.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper presents research on the impact of fly ash addition on selected physical and mechanical parameters of concrete made with slag cement. Experimental tests were carried out to measure the migration of chloride ions in concrete, the tightness of concrete exposed to water under pressure, and the compressive strength and tensile strength of concrete during splitting. Six series of concrete mixes made with CEM IIIA 42.5 and 32.5 cement were tested. The base concrete mix was modified by adding fly ash as a partial cement substitute in the amounts of 25% and 33%. A comparative analysis of the obtained results indicates a significant improvement in tightness, especially in concrete based on CEM IIIA 32.5 cement and resistance to chloride ion penetration for the concretes containing fly ash additive. In the concretes containing fly ash additive, a slower rate of initial strength increase and high strength over a long period of maturation are shown. In accordance with the presented research results, it is suggested that changes to the European standardization system be considered, to allow the use of fly ash additive in concrete made with CEM IIIA 42.5 or 32.5 cement classes. Such a solution is not currently acceptable in standards in some European Countries.},

ABSTRACT = {Three-dimensional (3D) printing continuous carbon fiber-reinforced polylactic acid (PLA) composites offer excellent tensile mechanical properties. The present study aimed to research the effect of process parameters on the tensile mechanical properties of 3D printing composite specimens through a series of mechanical experiments. The main printing parameters, including layer height, extrusion width, printing temperature, and printing speed are changed to manufacture specimens based on the modified fused filament fabrication 3D printer, and the tensile mechanical properties of 3D printing continuous carbon fiber-reinforced PLA composites are presented. By comparing the outcomes of experiments, the results show that relative fiber content has a significant impact on mechanical properties and the ratio of carbon fibers in composites is influenced by layer height and extrusion width. The tensile mechanical properties of continuous carbon fiber-reinforced composites gradually decrease with an increase of layer height and extrusion width. In addition, printing temperature and speed also affect the fiber matrix interface, i.e., tensile mechanical properties increase as the printing temperature rises, while the tensile mechanical properties decrease when the printing speed increases. Furthermore, the strengthening mechanism on the tensile mechanical properties is that external loads subjected to the components can be transferred to the carbon fibers through the fiber-matrix interface. Additionally, SEM images suggest that the main weakness of continuous carbon fiber-reinforced 3D printing composites exists in the fiber-matrix interface, and the main failure is the pull-out of the fiber caused by the interface destruction.},

ABSTRACT = {Extreme atmospheric conditions in the marine and offshore industry are harmful to engineering materials, especially to welded joints, and may cause degradation of their properties. This article presents the results of research on the plasticity of bead-on-plate welds made using two types of seamless, copper plated flux-cored wires. Before welding, spools with wire were stored for 1 month in two distinct locations with different geographical and industrial conditions in Poland, and then subjected to visual examination. Bead-on-plate welds were subjected to a static tensile test and on this basis plasticity indexes showing the effect of storage on plasticity were determined. The fractures after tensile tests and the surfaces of the wires were examined on an electron scanning microscope. Additionally, diffusible hydrogen content in deposited metal measurements for each condition were carried out. The highest degradation level was found for wire stored in an agricultural building in north-eastern Poland—there was an almost fourfold decrease in the plasticity index value and the highest diffusible hydrogen content. For the same wire and the same location, the largest difference was also observed in fracture morphology after the tensile test—ductile fracture was obtained for wire at delivery condition while an almost full cleavage fracture was found after relatively short (1 month) storage of wire.},

ABSTRACT = {Additive Manufacturing (AM) processes enable their deployment in broad applications from aerospace to art, design, and architecture. Part quality and performance are the main concerns during AM processes execution that the achievement of adequate characteristics can be guaranteed, considering a wide range of influencing factors, such as process parameters, material, environment, measurement, and operators training. Investigating the effects of not only the influential AM processes variables but also their interactions and coupled impacts are essential to process optimization which requires huge efforts to be made. Therefore, numerical simulation can be an effective tool that facilities the evaluation of the AM processes principles. Selective Laser Melting (SLM) is a widespread Powder Bed Fusion (PBF) AM process that due to its superior advantages, such as capability to print complex and highly customized components, which leads to an increasing attention paid by industries and academia. Temperature distribution and melt pool dynamics have paramount importance to be well simulated and correlated by part quality in terms of surface finish, induced residual stress and microstructure evolution during SLM. Summarizing numerical simulations of SLM in this survey is pointed out as one important research perspective as well as exploring the contribution of adopted approaches and practices. This review survey has been organized to give an overview of AM processes such as extrusion, photopolymerization, material jetting, laminated object manufacturing, and powder bed fusion. And in particular is targeted to discuss the conducted numerical simulation of SLM to illustrate a uniform picture of existing nonproprietary approaches to predict the heat transfer, melt pool behavior, microstructure and residual stresses analysis.},

ABSTRACT = {The design of advanced alloys specifically tailored to additive manufacturing processes is a research field that is attracting ever-increasing attention. Laser powder-bed fusion (LPBF) commonly uses pre-alloyed, fine powders (diameter usually 15–45 µm) to produce fully dense metallic parts. The availability of such fine, pre-alloyed powders reduces the iteration speed of alloy development for LPBF and renders it quite costly. Here, we overcome these drawbacks by performing in-situ alloying in LPBF starting with pure elemental powder mixtures avoiding the use of costly pre-alloyed powders. Pure iron, chromium, and nickel powder mixtures were used to perform in-situ alloying to manufacture 304 L stainless steel cube-shaped samples. Process parameters including scanning speed, laser power, beam diameter, and layer thickness were varied aiming at obtaining a chemically homogeneous alloy. The scientific questions focused on in this work are: which process parameters are required for producing such samples (in part already known in the state of the art), and why are these parameters conducive to homogeneity? Analytical modelling of the melt pool geometry and temperature field suggests that the residence time in the liquid state is the most important parameter controlling the chemical homogeneity of the parts. Results show that in-situ alloying can be successfully employed to enable faster and cost-efficient rapid alloy development.},

ABSTRACT = {This study investigated the influence of the curing time on the fracture toughness of concrete produced with different content of low calcium fly ash (LCFA). During the study, the amounts of 20% and 30% of pozzolanic additive were used. In order to observe the effect of the applied pozzolanic additive on the analyzed concrete properties, the obtained results were compared with the values obtained for the reference concrete. Compressive strength—fcm and fracture toughness, by using mode II loading—KIIc (shearing), were determined between the 3rd and 365th days of curing. In the course of experiments, changes in the development of cracks in individual series of concrete were also analyzed. In addition, the microstructures of all composites and the nature of macroscopic crack propagation in mature concretes were assessed. It was observed that the greatest increase in fracture toughness at shear was in the case of reference concrete during the first 28 days, whereas, in the case of concretes containing LCFA, in the period of time above 4 weeks. Furthermore, concrete without the LCFA additives were characterized by a brittle fracture. In contrast to it, concretes with LCFA additives are mainly characterized by a quasi-plastic process of failure. Moreover, most of the samples showed a typical pattern of the destruction that occurs as a result of shearing. The presented test results may be helpful in selecting the composition of concrete mixtures containing LCFA to be used in concrete and reinforced concrete structures subjected to shear loads.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, a comparison of the mechanical properties of high-strength low-alloy S460N steel welded joints is presented. The welded joints were made by the gas metal arc welding (GMAW) process in the air environment and water, by the local cavity welding method. Welded joints were tested following the EN ISO 15614-1:2017 standard. After welding, the non-destructive—visual, penetrant, radiographic, and ultrasonic (phased array) tests were performed. In the next step, the destructive tests, as static tensile-, bending-, impact- metallographic (macroscopic and microscopic) tests, and Vickers HV10 measurements were made. The influence of weld porosity on the mechanical properties of the tested joints was also assessed. The performed tests showed that the tensile strength of the joints manufactured in water (567 MPa) could be similar to the air welded joint (570 MPa). The standard deviations from the measurements were—47 MPa in water and 33 MPa in the air. However, it was also stated that in the case of a complex state of stress, for example, bending, torsional and tensile stresses, the welding imperfections (e.g., pores) significantly decrease the properties of the welded joint. In areas characterized by porosity the tensile strength decreased to 503 MPa. Significant differences were observed for bending tests. During the bending of the underwater welded joint, a smaller bending angle broke the specimen than was the case during the air welded joint bending. Also, the toughness and hardness of joints obtained in both environments were different. The minimum toughness for specimens welded in water was 49 J (in the area characterized by high porosity) and in the air it was 125 J (with a standard deviation of 23 J). The hardness in the heat-affected zone (HAZ) for the underwater joint in the non-tempered area was above 400 HV10 (with a standard deviation of 37 HV10) and for the air joint below 300 HV10 (with a standard deviation of 17 HV10). The performed investigations showed the behavior of S460N steel, which is characterized by a high value of carbon equivalent (CeIIW) 0.464%, during local cavity welding.},

ABSTRACT = {The necessity to progress towards sustainability has inspired modern researchers to examine the lubrication and cooling effects of vegetable oils on conventional metal cutting operations. Consequently, as an eco-friendly vegetable product, castor oil can be the right choice as Minimum quantity lubrication (MQL) base fluid. Nonetheless, the high viscosity of castor oil limits its flowability and restricts its industrial application. Conversely, palm oil possesses superior lubricity, as well as flowability characteristics. Hence, an attempt has been made to improve the lubrication behavior of castor oil. Here, six castor-palm mixtures (varying from 1:0.5–1:3) were utilized as MQL-fluid, and the values of machining responses viz. average surface roughness, specific cutting energy, and tool wear were evaluated. Furthermore, an integrated Shannon’s Entropy-based Technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) framework was employed for selecting the most suitable volume ratio of castor-palm oil mixture. The rank provided by the TOPSIS method confirmed that 1:2 was the best volume ratio for castor-palm oil mixture. Afterward, a comparative analysis demonstrated that the best castor-palm volume fraction resulted in 8.262 and 16.146% lowering of surface roughness, 5.459 and 7.971% decrement of specific cutting energy, 2.445 and 3.155% drop in tool wear compared to that of castor and palm oil medium, respectively.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper presents the results of the fracture toughness of concretes containing two mineral additives. During the tests, the method of loading the specimens according to Mode I fracture was used. The research included an evaluation of mechanical parameters of concrete containing noncondensed silica fume (SF) in an amount of 10% and siliceous fly ash (FA) in the following amounts: 0%, 10% and 20%. The experiments were carried out on mature specimens, i.e., after 28 days of curing and specimens at an early age, i.e., after 3 and 7 days of curing. In the course of experiments, the effect of adding SF to the value of the critical stress intensity factor—KIcS in FA concretes in different periods of curing were evaluated. In addition, the basic strength parameters of concrete composites, i.e., compressive strength—fcm and splitting tensile strength—fctm, were measured. A novelty in the presented research is the evaluation of the fracture toughness of concretes with two mineral additives, assessed at an early age. During the tests, the structures of all composites and the nature of macroscopic crack propagation were also assessed. A modern and useful digital image correlation (DIC) technique was used to assess macroscopic cracks. Based on the conducted research, it was found the application of SF to FA concretes contributes to a significant increase in the fracture toughness of these materials at an early age. Moreover, on the basis of the obtained test results, it was found that the values of the critical stress intensity factor of analyzed concretes were convergent qualitatively with their strength parameters. It also has been demonstrated that in the first 28 days of concrete curing, the preferred solution is to replace cement with SF in the amount of 10% or to use a cement binder substitution with a combination of additives in proportions 10% SF + 10% FA. On the other hand, the composition of mineral additives in proportions 10% SF + 20% FA has a negative effect on the fracture mechanics parameters of concretes at an early age. Based on the analysis of the results of microstructural tests and the evaluation of the propagation of macroscopic cracks, it was established that along with the substitution of the cement binder with the combination of mineral additives, the composition of the cement matrix in these composites changes, which implies a different, i.e., quasi-plastic, behavior in the process of damage and destruction of the material.},

ABSTRACT = {This research aims to examine the fracture toughness of hybrid fibrous geopolymer composites under mode II. For this purpose, eight geopolymer mixtures were cast and tested to evaluate the influence of steel and synthetic fiber hybridization on mode II fracture response. The first mixture was plain and was kept as a reference, while steel, polypropylene and glass fibers were used in the rest seven mixtures. The first three of which were mono-reinforced with one of the three fibers, while the rest of the four were hybrids reinforced with combinations of steel and synthetic fibers. The Brazilian center notched disc and the double notched cube test configurations were used to evaluate the mode II fracture toughness of the eight mixtures. The results of the tests showed that steel fibers played the vital role in enhancing the fracture toughness, where the mixtures S1.6 and S1.3G0.3 showed the best performance. The results also showed that increasing the notch depth decreased the fracture toughness with an approximate linear decrement fashion. It was found that the use of double-notched cubes resulted in much higher fracture toughness than the Brazilian notched discs, where the ratio of normalized fracture toughness of the disc specimens to cube specimens was approximately 0.37 to 0.47. This is attributed to the concentration of stresses along one defined path in the disc specimens compared to the multi-path stresses in the cube specimens. In addition, the accompanied tensile stresses in the disc specimens may lead to a mode I fracture before the designed mode II fracture.},

ABSTRACT = {Lightweight materials are finding plentiful applications in various engineering sectors due to their high strength-to-weight ratios. Hole-making is an inevitable requirement for their structural applications, which is often marred by thermal damages of the drill causing unacceptable shortening of tool life. Efficient cooling of the tool is a prime requirement for enhancing the process viability. The current work presents a novel technique of cooling only the twist drill between drilling of holes with no effect of the applied cryogenic coolant transferred to the work material. The technique is applied in the drilling of two commonly used high-strength lightweight materials: carbon fibers reinforced polymer (CFRP) and an alloy of titanium (Ti-6Al-4V). The efficacy of the cooling approach is compared with those of conventionally applied continuous cryogenic cooling and no-cooling. The effectiveness is quantified in terms of tool wear, thrust force, hole quality, specific cutting energy, productivity, and consumption of the cryogenic fluid. The experimental work leads to a finding that between-the-holes cryogenic cooling possesses a rich potential in curbing tool wear, reducing thrust force and specific energy consumption, and improving hole quality in drilling of CFRP. Regarding the titanium alloy, it yields a much better surface finish and lesser consumption of specific cutting energy.},

ABSTRACT = {In this study, dissimilar sheets including AA3003 aluminum and A441 AISI steel were welded via cooling-assisted friction stir welding (FSW). Three different cooling mediums including forced CO2, forced water, and forced air were employed, and a non-cooled sample was processed to compare the cooling-assisted condition with the traditional FSW condition. The highest cooling rate belongs to CO2 and the lowest cooling rate belongs to the non-cooled sample as FSW. The best macrograph without any segregation at interface belongs to the water-cooled sample and the poorest joint with notable segregation belongs to the CO2 cooling FSW sample. The CO2 cooling FSW sample exhibits the smallest grain size due to the suppression of grain growth during dynamic recrystallization (DRX). The intermetallic compound (IMC) thickening was suppressed by a higher cooling rate in CO2 cooling sample and just Al-rich phase was formed in this joint. The lowest cooling rate in the FSW sample exhibits formation of the Fe rich phase. The IMC layers were thicker at the top of the weld due to closeness with the heat generation source. The water cooling sample exhibits the highest tensile strength due to proper mechanical bonding simultaneously with optimum IMC thickness to provide appropriate metallurgical bonding. Fractography observation indicates that there is a semi-ductile fracture in the water cooling sample and CO2 cooling sample exhibits more brittle fracture. Hardness evaluation reveals that the higher the cooling rate formed, the higher the hardness in stir zone, and hardness changes in the aluminum side were higher than the steel side.},

Much research has been carried out in the proposed study field over the previous two decades. Therefore, it was required to analyze the research trend from the available bibliometric data. In this study, the scientometric analysis and science mapping techniques were performed along with a comprehensive discussion to identify the relevant publication field, highly used keywords, most active authors, most cited articles, and regions with largest impact on the field of fracture properties of cement-based materials (CBMs). Furthermore, the characteristic of various fibers such as steel, polymeric, inorganic, and carbon fibers are discussed, and the factors affecting the fracture properties of fiber-reinforced CBMs (FRCBMs) are reviewed. In addition, future gaps are identified. The graphical representation based on the scientometric review could be helpful for research scholars from different countries in developing research cooperation, creating joint ventures, and exchanging innovative technologies and ideas.},

Therefore, the current study investigates the effect of cutting parameters (spindle speed and feed rate) and three types of cutting-tool coating (TiN/TiAlN, TiAlN, and TiN) on the surface finish, form, and dimensional tolerances of holes drilled in Al6061-T651 alloy. The study employed statistical design of experiments and ANOVA (analysis of variance) to evaluate the contribution of each of the input parameters on the measured hole-quality outputs (surface-roughness metrics Ra and Rz, hole size, circularity, perpendicularity, and cylindricity). The highest surface roughness occurred when using TiN-coated tools. All holes in this study were oversized regardless of the tool coating or cutting parameters used. TiN tools, which have a lower coating hardness, gave lower hole circularity at the entry and higher cylindricity, while TiN/TiAlN and TiAlN seemed to be more effective in reducing hole particularity when drilling at higher spindle speeds. Finally, optical microscopes revealed that a built-up edge and adhesions were most likely to form on TiN-coated tools due to TiN’s chemical affinity and low oxidation temperature compared to the TiN/TiAlN and TiAlN coatings.},

ABSTRACT = {The features of composite materials such as production flexibility, lightness, and excellent strength put them in the class of materials that attract attention in various critical areas, i.e., aerospace, defense, automotive, and shipbuilding. However, the machining of composite materials displays challenges due to the difficulty in obtaining structural integrity. In this study, Cu/Mo-SiCP composite materials were produced by powder metallurgy with varied reinforcement ratios and then their machinability was investigated. In machinability experiments, the process parameters were selected as cutting speed (vC), feed rate (f), depth of cut (aP), and reinforcement ratio (RR). Two levels of these parameters were taken as per the Taguchi’s L8 orthogonal array, and response surface methodology (RSM) is employed for parametric optimization. As a result, the outcomes demonstrated that RR = 5%, f = 0.25 mm/rev, aP = 0.25 mm, vC = 200 m/min for surface roughness, RR = 0%, f = 0.25 mm/rev and aP = 0.25 mm and vC = 200 m/min for flank wear and RR = 0%, f = 0.25 mm/rev, aP = 0.25 mm, vC = 150 m/min for cutting temperature for cutting temperature and flank wear should be selected for the desired results. In addition, ANOVA results indicate that reinforcement ratio is the dominant factor on all response parameters. Microscope images showed that the prominent failure modes on the cutting tool are flank wear, built up edge, and crater wear depending on reinforcement ratio.},

ABSTRACT = {As widely-available silicon solar cells, the development of GaAs-based solar cells has been ongoing for many years. Although cells on the gallium arsenide basis today achieve the highest efficiency of all, they are not very widespread. They have particular specifications that make them attractive, especially for certain areas. Thanks to their durability under challenging conditions, it is possible to operate them in places where other solar cells have already undergone significant degradation.

ABSTRACT = {The purpose of the following study was to compare the effect of the shape of a tool on the joint and to obtain the values of Friction Stir Welding (FSW) parameters that provide the best possible joint quality. The material used was an aluminium alloy, EN AW-3004 (AlMn1Mg1). To the authors’ best knowledge, no investigations of this alloy during FSW have been presented earlier. Five butt joints were made with a self-developed, cylindrical, and tapered threaded tool with a rotational speed of 475 rpm. In order to compare the welding parameters, two more joints with a rotational speed of 475 rpm and seven joints with a welding speed of 300 mm/min with the use of a cylindrical threaded pin were performed. This involved a visual inspection as well as a tensile strength test of the welded joints. It was observed that the value of the material outflow for the joints made with the cylindrical threaded pin was higher than it was for the joints made with the tapered threaded pin. However, welding defects in the form of voids appeared in the joints made with the tapered threaded tool. The use of the cylindrical tool resulted in higher values for about 37% of mechanical properties compared with the highest result for the tapered threaded joint. As far as the parameters were concerned, it was concluded that most of the specimens were properly joined for a rotational speed of 475 rpm. In the joints made with a welding speed of 300 mm/min, the material was not stirred properly. The best joint quality was given for a rotational speed of 475 rpm as well as a variety of welding speed values between 150 and 475 mm/min.},

ABSTRACT = {Tribological properties of engineering components are a key issue due to their effect on the operational performance factors such as wear, surface characteristics, service life and in situ behavior. Thus, for better component quality, process parameters have major importance, especially for metal matrix composites (MMCs), which are a special class of materials used in a wide range of engineering applications including but not limited to structural, automotive and aeronautics. This paper deals with the tribological behavior of Cu-B-CrC composites (Cu-main matrix, B-CrC-reinforcement by 0, 2.5, 5 and 7.5 wt.%). The tribological characteristics investigated in this study are the coefficient of friction, wear rate and weight loss. For this purpose, four levels of sliding distance (1000, 1500, 2000 and 2500 m) and four levels of applied load (10, 15, 20 and 25 N) were used. In addition, two levels of sliding velocity (1 and 1.5 m/s), two levels of sintering time (1 and 2 h) and two sintering temperatures (1000 and 1050 °C) were used. Taguchi’s L16 orthogonal array was used to statistically analyze the aforementioned input parameters and to determine their best levels which give the desired values for the analyzed tribological characteristics. The results were analyzed by statistical analysis, optimization and 3D surface plots. Accordingly, it was determined that the most effective factor for wear rate, weight loss and friction coefficients is the contribution rate. According to signal-to-noise ratios, optimum solutions can be sorted as: the highest levels of parameters except for applied load and reinforcement ratio (2500 m, 10 N, 1.5 m/s, 2 h, 1050 °C and 0 wt.%) for wear rate, certain levels of all parameters (1000 m, 10 N, 1.5 m/s, 2 h, 1050 °C and 2.5 wt.%) for weight loss and 1000 m, 15 N, 1 m/s, 1 h, 1000 °C and 0 wt.% for the coefficient of friction. The comprehensive analysis of findings has practical significance and provides valuable information for a composite material from the production phase to the actual working conditions.},

ABSTRACT = {The adoption of green technology is very important to protect the environment and thus there is a need for improving the existing methods for the fabrication of carbon materials. As such, this work proposes to discuss, interrogate, and propose viable hydrothermal, solvothermal, and other advanced carbon materials synthesis methods. The synthesis approaches for advanced carbon materials to be interrogated will include the synthesis of carbon dots, carbon nanotubes, nitrogen/titania-doped carbons, graphene quantum dots, and their nanocomposites with solid/polymeric/metal oxide supports. This will be performed with a particular focus on microwave-assisted solvothermal and hydrothermal synthesis due to their favourable properties such as rapidity, low cost, and being green/environmentally friendly. These methods are regarded as important for the current and future synthesis and modification of advanced carbon materials for application in energy, gas separation, sensing, and water treatment. Simultaneously, the work will take cognisance of methods reducing the fabrication costs and environmental impact while enhancing the properties as a direct result of the synthesis methods. As a direct result, the expectation is to impart a significant contribution to the scientific body of work regarding the improvement of the said fabrication methods.},

ABSTRACT = {Silicon nitride (SiNx) and hydrogenated silicon nitride (SiNx:H) thin films enjoy widespread scientific interest across multiple application fields. Exceptional combination of optical, mechanical, and thermal properties allows for their utilization in several industries, from solar and semiconductor to coated glass production. The wide bandgap (~5.2 eV) of thin films allows for its optoelectronic application, while the SiNx layers could act as passivation antireflective layers or as a host matrix for silicon nano-inclusions (Si-ni) for solar cell devices. In addition, high water-impermeability of SiNx makes it a potential candidate for barrier layers of organic light emission diodes (OLEDs). This work presents a review of the state-of-the-art process techniques and applications of SiNx and SiNx:H thin films. We focus on the trends and latest achievements of various deposition processes of recent years. Historically, different kinds of chemical vapor deposition (CVD), such as plasma enhanced (PE-CVD) or hot wire (HW-CVD), as well as electron cyclotron resonance (ECR), are the most common deposition methods, while physical vapor deposition (PVD), which is primarily sputtering, is also widely used. Besides these fabrication methods, atomic layer deposition (ALD) is an emerging technology due to the fact that it is able to control the deposition at the atomic level and provide extremely thin SiNx layers. The application of these three deposition methods is compared, while special attention is paid to the effect of the fabrication method on the properties of SiNx thin films, particularly the optical, mechanical, and thermal properties.},

ABSTRACT = {This investigation attempts to explore the weld characteristics of a laser welded dissimilar joint of ferritic/martensitic 9Cr-1Mo-V-Nb (P91) steel and Incoloy 800HT austenitic nickel alloy. This dissimilar joint is essential in power generating nuclear and thermal plants operating at 600–650 °C. In such critical operating conditions, it is essential for a dissimilar joint to preserve its characteristics and be free from any kind of defect. The difference between the physical properties of P91 and Incoloy 800HT makes their weldability challenging. Thus, the need for detailed characterization of this dissimilar weld arises. The present work intends to explore the usage of an unconventional welding process (i.e., laser beam welding) and its effect on the joint’s characteristics. The single-pass laser welding technique was employed to obtain maximum penetration through the keyhole mode. The welded joint morphology and mechanical properties were studied in as-welded (AW) and post-weld heat treatment (PWHT) conditions. The macro-optical examination shows the complete penetrations with no inclusion and porosities in the weld. The microstructural study was done in order to observe the precipitation and segregation of elements in dendritic and interface regions. Solidification cracks were observed in the weld fusion zone, confirming the susceptibility of Incoloy 800HT to such cracks due to a mismatch between the melting point and thermal conductivity of the base metals. Failure from base metal was observed in tensile test results of standard AW specimen with a yield stress of 265 MPa, and after PWHT, the value increased to 297 MPa. The peak hardness of 391 HV was observed in the P91 coarse grain heat-affected zone (CGHAZ), and PWHT confirmed the reduction in hardness. The impact toughness results that were obtained were inadequate, as the maximum value of impact toughness was obtained for AW P91 heat-affected zone (HAZ) 108 J and the minimum for PWHT Incoloy 800HT HAZ 45 J. Thus, difficulty in obtaining a dissimilar joint with Incoloy 800HT using the laser beam welding technique was observed due to its susceptibility to solidification cracking.},

ABSTRACT = {Siliceous fly ash (FA) is the main additive to currently produced concretes. The utilization of this industrial waste carries an evident pro-ecological factor. In addition, such actions have a positive effect on the structure and mechanical parameters of mature concrete. Unfortunately, the problem of using FA as a Portland cement replacement is that it significantly reduces the performance of concretes in the early stages of their curing. This limits the possibility of using this type of concrete, e.g., in prefabrication, where it is required to obtain high-strength composites after short periods of curing. In order to minimize these negative effects, this research was undertaken to increase the early strength of concretes with FA through the application of a specifically formulated chemical nano-admixture (NA) in the form of seeds of the C-S-H phase. The NA was used to accelerate the strength growth in concretes. Therefore, this paper presents results of tests of modified concretes both with the addition of FA and with innovative NA. The analyses were carried out based on the results of the macroscopic and microstructural tests in five time periods, i.e., after 4, 8, 12, 24 and 72 h. The results of tests carried out with the use of NA clearly indicate the possibility of using FA in a wide range of management areas in sustainable concrete prefabrication.},

ABSTRACT = {This article deals with the dissimilar joining of two different grade Cr-Mo steel (2.25Cr-1Mo: P22 and modified 9Cr-1Mo: P91) for power plant application. The dissimilar butt-welded joint was produced for conventional V groove design by using the gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW) process with the application of an ERNiCrMo-3 Ni-based super alloy filler. A microstructure characterization was performed to measure the inhomogeneity in the microstructure and element diffusion across the interface in a welded joint. The experiments were also performed to evaluate the mechanical properties of the dissimilar welded joint in as-welded (AW) and post-weld heat treatment (PWHT) conditions. An acceptable level of the mechanical properties was obtained for the AW joint. After PWHT, a significant level of the element diffusion across the interface of the weld metal and P22 steel was observed, resulting in heterogeneity in microstructure near the interface, which was also supported by the hardness variation. Inhomogeneity in mechanical properties (impact strength and hardness) was measured across the weldments for the AW joint and was reduced after the PWHT. The tensile test results indicate an acceptable level of tensile properties for the welded joint in both AW and PWHT conditions and failure was noticed in the weak region of the P22 steel instead of the weld metal.},

ABSTRACT = {The enormous use of cutting fluid in machining leads to an increase in machining costs, along with different health hazards. Cutting fluid can be used efficiently using the MQL (minimum quantity lubrication) method, which aids in improving the machining performance. This paper contains multiple responses, namely, force, surface roughness, and temperature, so there arises a need for a multicriteria optimization technique. Therefore, in this paper, multiobjective optimization based on ratio analysis (MOORA), VIseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR), and technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) are used to solve different multiobjective problems, and response surface methodology is also used for optimization and to validate the results obtained by multicriterion decision-making technique (MCDM) techniques. The design of the experiment is based on the Box–Behnken technique, which used four input parameters: feed rate, depth of cut, cutting speed, and nanofluid concentration, respectively. The experiments were performed on AISI 304 steel in turning with minimum quantity lubrication (MQL) and found that the use of hybrid nanofluid (Alumina–Graphene) reduces response parameters by approximately 13% in forces, 31% in surface roughness, and 14% in temperature, as compared to Alumina nanofluid. The response parameters are analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA), where the depth of cut and feed rate showed a major impact on response parameters. After using all three MCDM techniques, it was found that, at fixed weight factor with each MCDM technique, a similar process parameter was achieved (velocity of 90 m/min, feed of 0.08 mm/min, depth of cut of 0.6 mm, and nanoparticle concentration of 1.5%, respectively) for optimum response. The above stated multicriterion techniques employed in this work aid decision makers in selecting optimum parameters depending upon the desired targets. Thus, this work is a novel approach to studying the effectiveness of hybrid nanofluids in the machining of AISI 304 steel using MCDM techniques.},

ABSTRACT = {First-principles density functional theory (DFT) is employed to study the electronic structure of oxygen and gallium vacancies in monoclinic bulk β-Ga2O3 crystals. Hybrid exchange–correlation functional B3LYP within the density functional theory and supercell approach were successfully used to simulate isolated point defects in β-Ga2O3. Based on the results of our calculations, we predict that an oxygen vacancy in β-Ga2O3 is a deep donor defect which cannot be an effective source of electrons and, thus, is not responsible for n-type conductivity in β-Ga2O3. On the other hand, all types of charge states of gallium vacancies are sufficiently deep acceptors with transition levels more than 1.5 eV above the valence band of the crystal. Due to high formation energy of above 10 eV, they cannot be considered as a source of p-type conductivity in β-Ga2O3.},

ABSTRACT = {Titanium and its alloys exhibit numerous uses in aerospace, automobile, biomedical and marine industries because of their enhanced mechanical properties. However, the machinability of titanium alloys can be cumbersome due to their lower density, high hardness, low thermal conductivity, and low elastic modulus. The wire electrical discharge machining (WEDM) process is an effective choice for machining titanium and its alloys due to its unique machining characteristics. The present work proposes multi-objective optimization of WEDM on Ti6Al4V alloy using a fuzzy integrated multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach. The use of MCDM has become an active area of research due to its proven ability to solve complex problems. The novelty of the present work is to use integrated fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and fuzzy technique for order preference by similarity to ideal situation (TOPSIS) to optimize the WEDM process. The experiments were systematically conducted adapting the face-centered central composite design approach of response surface methodology. Three independent factors—pulse-on time (Ton), pulse-off time (Toff), and current—were chosen, each having three levels to monitor the process response in terms of cutting speed (VC), material removal rate (MRR), and surface roughness (SR). To assess the relevance and significance of the models, an analysis of variance was carried out. The optimal process parameters after integrating fuzzy AHP coupled with fuzzy TOPSIS approach found were Ton = 40 µs, Toff = 15 µs, and current = 2A.},

ABSTRACT = {This article studied the effects of pin angle on heat generation and temperature distribution during friction stir welding (FSW) of AA1100 aluminum alloy and St-14 low carbon steel. A validated computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model was implemented to simulate the FSW process. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was employed in order to investigate internal materials’ flow. Simulation results revealed that the mechanical work on the joint line increased with the pin angle and larger stir zone forms. The simulation results show that in the angled pin tool, more than 26% of the total heat is produced by the pin. Meanwhile, in other cases, the total heat produced by the pin was near 15% of the total generated heat. The thermo-mechanical cycle in the steel zone increased, and consequently, mechanical interlock between base metals increased. The simulation output demonstrated that the frictional heat generation with a tool without a pin angle is higher than an angled pin. The calculation result also shows that the maximum heat was generated on the steel side.},

ABSTRACT = {Graphene has been widely and extensively used in mass sensing applications. The present study focused on exploring the use of single-layer graphene (SLG) and double-layer graphene (DLG) as sensing devices. The dynamic analysis of SLG and DLG with different boundary conditions (BDs) and length was executed using the atomistic finite element method (AFEM). SLG and DLG sheets were modelled and considered as a space–frame structure similar to a 3D beam. Spring elements (Combin14) were used to identify the interlayer interactions between two graphene layers in the DLG sheet due to the van der Waals forces. Simulations were carried out to visualize the behavior of the SLG and DLG subjected to different BDs and when used as mass sensing devices. The variation in frequency was noted by changing the length and applied mass of the SLGs and DLGs. The quantity of the frequency was found to be highest in the armchair SLG (6, 6) for a 50 nm sheet length and lowest in the chiral SLG (16, 4) for a 20 nm sheet length in the bridged condition. When the mass was 0.1 Zg, the frequency for the zigzag SLG (20, 0) was higher in both cases. The results show that the length of the sheet and the various mass values have a significant impact on the dynamic properties. The present research will contribute to the ultra-high frequency nano-resonance applications.},

ABSTRACT = {This study presents test results and in-depth discussion regarding the measurement of the fracture mechanics parameters of new concrete composites based on quaternary blended cements (QBC). A composition of the two most commonly used mineral additives, i.e., fly ash (FA) and silica fume (SF), in combination with nanosilica (nS), has been proposed as a partial replacement for ordinary Portland cement (OPC) binder. Four series of concrete were made, one of which was the reference concrete (REF) and the remaining three were QBC. During the research, the main mechanical parameters of compressive strength (fcm) and splitting tensile strength (fctm), as well as fracture mechanics parameters and the critical stress intensity factor KIcS, along with critical crack-tip opening displacements (CTODc) were investigated. Based on the tests, it was found that the total addition of siliceous materials, i.e., SF + nS without FA, increases the strength and fracture parameters of concrete by approximately 40%. On the other hand, supplementing the composition of the binder with SF and nS with 5% of FA additive causes an increase in all mechanical parameters by approximately 10%, whereas an increase by another 10% in the FA content in the concrete mix causes a significant decrease in all the analyzed factors by 10%, compared to the composite with the addition of silica modifiers only.},

ABSTRACT = {The use of the friction stir welding (FSW) process as a relatively new solid-state welding technology in the aerospace industry has pushed forward several developments in different related aspects of this strategic industry. In terms of the FSW process itself, due to the geometric limitations involved in the conventional FSW process, many variants have been required over time to suit the different types of geometries and structures, which has resulted in the development of numerous variants such as refill friction stir spot welding (RFSSW), stationary shoulder friction stir welding (SSFSW), and bobbin tool friction stir welding (BTFSW). In terms of FSW machines, significant development has occurred in the new design and adaptation of the existing machining equipment through the use of their structures or the new and specially designed FSW heads. In terms of the most used materials in the aerospace industry, there has been development of new high strength-to-weight ratios such as the 3rd generation aluminum–lithium alloys that have become successfully weldable by FSW with fewer welding defects and a significant improvement in the weld quality and geometric accuracy. The purpose of this article is to summarize the state of knowledge regarding the application of the FSW process to join materials used in the aerospace industry and to identify gaps in the state of the art. This work describes the fundamental techniques and tools necessary to make soundly welded joints. Typical applications of FSW processes are surveyed, including friction stir spot welding, RFSSW, SSFSW, BTFSW, and underwater FSW. Conclusions and suggestions for future development are proposed.},
