Herein, the effect of the shear flow on the growth of columnar crystals in an undercooled melt is studied. The asymptotic method is used to solve the dynamic model for the growth of a columnar crystal. The resulting asymptotic solution shows that the shear flow significantly changes the interface morphology of the columnar crystal. With the shear effect of the forced flow, the growth rate of the columnar interface increases in the shear direction of the shear flow. As the shear rate of the shear flow further increases, the interface of the columnar crystal is seriously deformed and distorted. The shear flow causes the columnar crystal in the undercooled melt to tend to evolve into smaller crystals in the initial stage of crystal growth. The analytical result provides a prediction of the formation of interface microstructures during solidification through the change of processing parameters.
The formation of morphological patterns with respect to the solidification of microstructures is of fundamental significance in materials science and processing engineering. Extensive experimental and theoretical works have been undertaken by the inclusion of various small-scale effects such as interface kinetics, anisotropy, etc., among which convection effects of the forced flow are of utmost importance regarding morphological pattern formation [
1
,
2
,
3
,
4
,
5
,
6
,
7
]. The treatment of generating convection in experimental frames and practical applications is performed to exert mechanical stirring or electro-magnetic stirring on the melt. The induced convection by the forced flow in the undercooled melt strongly alters the solidification kinetics, which in turn changes the morphological pattern formation of microstructures. As a result, a great number of crystals with micro and even nanometer scales form in the melt and significantly improve the grain refinement and second phase particle microstructures and consequently the physical and mechanical properties of solidified materials [
8
,
9
,
10
,
11
].
The morphological pattern formation of microstructures is a nonlinear dynamic problem, in which the growing interface’s shape is a part of the solution. Generally, it is hard to obtain the exact solution and for a solution to apply numerical approaches accurately. During crystal growth, the interface is always moving. The division and allocation of the upper and lower meshes of the interface in numerical approaches have some inevitably artificial assumptions. Hence, although they handle many large and complex systems, numerical methods have inherent defects in revealing the physical essence. They are effective means to seek the approximate analytical solution, which has a concise mathematical expression and unambiguous physical nature [
1
,
3
,
4
]. Convection in the melt is complex; however, the fluid velocity near the crystal can be decomposed into a superposition of a uniform flow and a linear flow, among which it has been demonstrated that the shear flow of a forced flow on crystal growth dominates in the solidification of microstructures [
12
,
13
,
14
]. The morphological patterns of spherical particles growing from a supersaturated solution or from a supercooled melt have widely been studied [
15
,
16
,
17
,
18
]. As perhaps the simplest case of the spherical particles, we investigate the shear effect of the forced flow on the growth of columnar crystals in the supercooled melt [
19
,
20
]. Using the asymptotic method, we find the asymptotic solution of the dynamic model for the growth of the columnar crystal and show the prediction of the formation of interface microstructures during solidification through the change of the processing parameters.
Consider the growth of a right infinite columnar crystal with an initial radius of a circular column

 in a convective undercooled melt. It is assumed that the melt is undercooled to a temperature

). The convection in the undercooled melt is driven by a forced flow when the melt is placed on a rotational disk. The convection velocity near the columnar crystal can be decomposed into a superposition of uniform flow and linear flow, in which it is assumed that the convection velocity

It is easily testified that the asymptotic solution in (59)–(61) does not satisfy the initial conditions for the temperature fields. This is caused by the early-time behavior of crystal growth from the assumption 




∂


/


∂


t


=


O


(

)




. In order to solve for the early-time behavior, we introduce the fast time variable 






t


^




=


t


/


ε




 and seek the inner solution with respect to time (see 
Appendix B
). Consequently, we can match the inner solution with the solution in Equations (58)–(62) and obtain the uniformly valid asymptotic solution of the columnar crystal growth in the whole melt region. Since the phase transformation occurs near the interface, the asymptotic solution in (59)–(61) shows the variations in the temperature and the interface of the columnar crystal during the growth of the columnar crystal.
With the asymptotic solution in (58)–(62), we use the following physical parameters of a Cu–Fe alloy with face-centered cubic (f.c.c) structures and analyze the interface morphologies of the columnar crystal under the influence of an anisotropic interface energy and the shear effect of the forced flow.
The physical parameters of a Cu–Fe alloy are as follows:

Figure 1
, 
Figure 2
, 
Figure 3
 and 
Figure 4
 show the interface morphologies of a columnar crystal growing in an undercooled melt under the influence of an anisotropic interface energy and forced flow. 
Figure 1
 shows the cross-sectional curves of the interface morphology of a columnar crystal growing in an undercooled melt under the influence of anisotropic interface energy. It is seen that during the initial growth times from 




t


=


0




 to 




t


≈


0.6




, some part of the interface of the columnar crystal in the <110> growth directions decays inwardly, whereas the other part of the interface grows outwardly in the <100> preferred growth directions.
Figure 2
 shows that when the inward decay proceeds up to a certain distance, the parts of the interface of the columnar crystal in the <110> growth directions begin to grow outwardly. During the initial growth process, the inward decay of the part of the interface induced by the anisotropic interface energy results in the smaller inner radius, which is less than the critical nucleation radius 






R


*






. The local inward growth and outward growth of the columnar crystal deforms the interface of the columnar crystal and forms the remarkable ear-like interface shape with some parts concave and other parts convex. As the anisotropic interface energy parameters increase, the interface increases in the <100> preferred growth directions and decreases in the <110> growth directions. The columnar crystal with a smaller inner radius than the critical nucleation radius 






R


*






 tends to be locally re-melted or broken.
Figure 3
 shows the interface morphology of the columnar crystal under the influence of the forced flow. When affected by the shear flow, the ‘ear-like’ interface shape of the columnar crystal induced by the anisotropic effect of the interface energy is deformed. As the shear rate increases, the ‘ear-like’ interface of the columnar crystal is distorted and recedes further inward near the angles of 




θ


=


3


π


/


4




, leading to the splitting tendency of the columnar crystal (as seen in 
Figure 4
). This phenomenon implies that the shear effect of the forced flow aggravates the local melting tendency that was caused by the possession of a smaller inner radius than the critical nucleation radius 






R


*






, leading to the splitting of the distorted columnar crystal during the initial crystal growth to form finer crystals.
Figure 5
 shows the variations in the interface growth velocity along different growth directions under the shear effect of the forced flow. The shear flow causes the different growth velocity of the interface at different growth directions, leading to the distortion of the interface. With the growth of the columnar crystal, the interface of the columnar crystal is further distorted. As a result, the interface of the columnar crystal tends to split into several smaller crystals.
Figure 6
 and 
Figure 7
 show the variations in the temperature near the interface along different growth directions under the shear effect of the forced flow at different times. It can be observed that along some growth directions (
Figure 6
), the shear flow induces the larger interface temperature gradient, whereas along other growth directions (
Figure 7
), it decreases the interface temperature gradient. The increase in the interface temperature gradient enhances the growth velocity of the interface, but the decrease in the interface temperature gradient depresses the growth velocity of the interface. Due to the shear flow around the columnar crystal, the temperature gradient along the direction from the polar angle causes the accelerated growth of some parts of the interface but the accelerated extrusion of other parts of the interface. When the growth of the columnar crystal (the interface where the arrows point) is oriented to the right, the interface of the columnar crystal is distorted. Since the inward growth of the interface in the initial stage of crystal growth led to a smaller inner radius than the critical nucleation radius of the columnar crystal 






R


*






, the interface of the columnar crystal splits into multiple smaller crystals in the initial stage of crystal growth. Each split particle is of the same order of magnitude in the initial stage of crystal growth. Under the shear effect of the forced flow, they will continuously split until the end of solidification to refine the microstructures
As an application, we have conducted the calculation of the microstructural formation of the second phase nanoparticles in a centrifugal casting experiment of as-cast Cu–Fe–Co alloys [

, the anisotropy parameter of interface kinetics is taken as

R

 is in the range of 0.33~0.85 nm. According to our theoretical result, the relative undercooling parameter 


ε


 is in the range of 0.20~0.58; the nanoparticles formed in the Cu–Fe–Co alloy melt are of the same order of magnitude as the critical radius for nucleation. Since the anisotropy of the interface kinetics induces the local inward growth of the nuclei after nucleation, the nuclei have radii less than the critical radius of nucleation 






R


*






 and thus tend to split. Under the shear effect of the forced flow, the nuclei are deformed and distorted. As a result, the interface of the particle splits or is broken into multiple finer particles in the initial stage of growth after nucleation. The finer particles repeat the same process to form particles at a nano scale. We should understand that even if one nucleus has split into several smaller particles in the melt, it is hard to judge whether these smaller particles have just split from this particle. By contrast, it was observed that if the shear flow is not exerted in the melt, the dispersed iron nano particles’ second phase and nano grains are difficult to obtain in the Cu–Fe–Co alloy matrix [
6
,
9
].
We have studied the shear effect of the forced flow on the growth of the columnar crystal interface in an undercooled melt. By using the asymptotic method, we solved the asymptotic solution of the dynamic model for the columnar crystal. The asymptotic solution of the temperature and interface morphology reveals that the shear flow significantly changes the interface morphology of the columnar crystal in the initial stage of crystal growth. As the shear rate of the forced flow shear rate increases, the growth velocity of the columnar interface increases in the shear direction of the forced flow. With the further increase in the shear rate, the interface of the columnar crystal seriously deforms and distorts, eventually evolving into smaller crystals in the initial stage of crystal growth. Each split particle is of the same order of magnitude in the initial stage of crystal growth. Under the shear effect of the forced flow, they will continuously split. The split crystals repeat the same process until the end of solidification to refine their microstructures. The analytical solution of the dynamic model for columnar crystal growth contains the relevant processing parameters during solidification and suggests definite physical explanations. The splitting mechanism of the nuclei revealed by the solution has been evidenced in our experiment involving Cu alloys. The analytical solution provides a prediction of the formation of interface microstructures during solidification through the change in processing parameters. Future work is expected to extend the model for multi-component alloy systems and applications in a wide variety of alloys such as aluminum alloys and nickel base alloys.
