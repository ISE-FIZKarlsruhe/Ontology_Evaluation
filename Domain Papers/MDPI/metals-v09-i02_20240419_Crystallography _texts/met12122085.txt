. The nonclassical model of homogeneous nucleation is used to predict 
T

, T

 and the specific heat. The singular values of (f) leading to (

). Values of (

) can be higher than (2 T

) for 
T

/T

 < 0.7069. A specific heat equal to zero is predicted after cooling from 
T
 ≤ 2 T

 and would correspond to a glassy phase. Weak glassy fractions are nucleated near (
T

) without transition at (T

Liquid-liquid phase transitions occur in glass-forming melts at temperatures 
T

 above Tm, the equilibrium thermodynamic melting transition of crystals [

]. These transitions often result from the separation of two liquid states, occurring in all supercooled materials at a temperature 
T
x
 < T
m
, including pure elements in which two liquid phases of the same composition coexist. A liquid fraction crystallizes at T
x
 and melts at T
m
 while the complementary glassy fraction melts at 
T
n+
 = T
g
 [
22
,
23
,
24
]. The purpose of this publication is to relate all the liquid-liquid transitions, occurring above the melting temperature (T
m
) in Bi and Sn up to (2 T
m
), and beyond, to glass transition temperatures [
1
,
3
,

]. A weak glassy fraction disappeared at 784 K in Sn as recently observed with specific heat measurements [
5
]. Here, we recall that (
T

Molecular dynamics simulations were employed to study the thermodynamics and kinetics of the glass transition and crystallization in deeply undercooled liquid Ag and Ag-Cu at high cooling rates of the order of 10
12
 K/s [
25
,
26
]. A first order transition from the liquid-phase (L) to a metastable, heterogeneous phase called G-phase was observed, leading to a glassy phase below the recovery temperature 
T
n+
 of the enthalpy above T
m
. The L–G transition occurred by nucleation of the G-phase from the L-phase. The lowest glass transition temperature of liquid-phase (L) depends on its Lindemann coefficient and is much weaker than the nucleation temperature of G-phase [
27
,
28
,
29
,
30
]. Increasing the heating rate increased the glass transition temperature of liquid (L). A first order transition from liquid (L) to G-glass was observed, when a supercooled liquid evolved isothermally below its melting temperature at deep undercooling [
26
]. Several simulations of G-phases in various elements showed full melting heat H
m
 at various temperatures 
T
n+
 = T
g
 in Ag [
25
], in Zr [
31
], in Cu and in Fe [
32
]. The values of 
T
n+
 were determined from singular values of G-phase frozen enthalpy, employing the nonclassical homogeneous nucleation (NCHN) model to predict 
T
x
, T
n+
 and the enthalpy. Singular values of (
f
) leading to (
T
n+
) correspond to percolation thresholds of broken bonds (configurons) leading to glassy phases during cooling below 
T
n+
 [
24
,
29
,
30
,
33
,
34
].
The high undercooling rates of bulk liquid elements have been known for many years [
35
]. Consequently, we plan to confirm, in this publication, that the nucleation of G-phases and their glass transition temperatures above T
m
 are observable without employing heating and cooling rates of the order of 10
10
 to 10
13
 K/s to escape from crystallization. A phase diagram of glassy fractions, occurring in molten elements at 
T
x
 < T
m
, is proposed, completing the diagram already established for 
T
x
 > T
m
 [
30
] in agreement with previous molecular dynamics simulations [
25
,
26
,
31
,
32
]. The specific heat values at 
T
g
 = T
n+
 is predicted up to 
T
g
 = 2 T
m
 where a glassy phase transition is expected. The density far above T
m
 depends on the formation time of bonds increasing glassy phase fractions. Resistivity decreases are due to the increase in (
f
) in these liquids [
4
].
Three liquid states are present in all melts with complementary enthalpies introduced in the classical Gibbs free energy change which are equal to ε

H

, 
ε

H

 and Δ
ε

H

 [
36
], with H

 being the melting enthalpy. The coefficient (
ε

) is attached to the initial liquid state before adding new atomic bonds induced by cooling while (
ε
gs
) is obtained by including them. The coefficient Δ
ε
lg
, equal to the difference (
ε

 − ε
gs
), is attributed to the formation of a new liquid state describing the contribution of new bonds. For liquid elements, that are easily crystallized, the liquid enthalpy coefficients obey to the following [

(θ
g
) is the latent heat coefficient, accompanying the glass transition during the first cooling and the formation of Phase 3 below the percolation threshold of bonds. The partial breaking of bonds during reheating occurs without latent heat [
2
]. This type of enthalpy relaxation due to the development of bonds below the percolation threshold at T
g
 was observed after quenching glass-forming melts in amorphous state and heating them at 20 K/min [
37
,
38
,
39
,
40
,
41
,
42
]. After these relaxation phenomena, the glass transition occurs without latent heat.
Coefficient minima (ε
lso
) and (ε
gso
) were initially determined to be equal to 0.217 [
43
]. They were the average of many liquid element coefficients deduced from the undercooling rate of each of them corresponding to the mean value 0.103 of their Lindemann coefficient [
27
,
28
,
29
]. The number 2.25, initially equal to 2.5 in Equation (1), consequently, fixed the VFT temperature to T
m
/3 [
44
]. It appeared later that (Δ
ε
lg
) in Equation (3) is the enthalpy coefficient of a true thermodynamic phase called “Phase 3” discovered for the first time in supercooled water [
45
,
46
,
47
]. It is now a generic name that we extend to all glassy phases, and to those resulting from a first-order transition [
37
]. Phase 3 could be the congruent bond lattice predicted for disordered oxide systems [
48
], extended later to critical packing density formation applied to broken bonds (configurons), producing the glass transitions at T
g<<<
 [
33
,
49
]. A fraction (Δε
lg
) of atomic bonds equal to various percolation thresholds still exists up to 
T
n+
, in all glass-forming melts [
23
,
34
,
50
]. Phase 3 results from the formation of configuron phases [
50
].
A configuron is an elementary configurational excitation in an amorphous material, formed by breaking of a chemical bond (or transformation of an atom from one to another atomic shell) and the associated strain-releasing local adjustment of centers of atomic vibration [
48
]. For metals, evidence on configuron formation was first demonstrated by Iwashita et al. [
51
]. The temperature dependence of configuron contents is provided by Gibbs statistics [
52
,
53
]. The melting of an amorphous solid differs from the melting of a crystal. Glasses, on heating continuously, change most of their properties to those of a liquid-like state in contrast to crystals, where such changes occur abruptly at a fixed temperature (the melting point) which is explained by the high mobility of broken bonds tending to condense on irregularities of crystals, such as surfaces and inclusions. Therefore, there are no discontinuities in the volume and entropy changes at T
g
 [
33
]. 
The NCHN model predicted the formation conditions of glacial phases (Phase 3) in Ag-Cu and Ag liquids at various heating rates as previously described by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, showing full melting at 
T
n+
 = 1.119 T
m
 for Zr, 1.126 T
m
 for Ag, 1.219 T
m
 for Fe and 1.354 T
m
 for Cu [
25
,
26
,
31
,
32
]. These phenomena are governed by singular values of the enthalpy Δ
ε
lg
 of glassy Phase 3, formed at nucleation temperatures T
nG
 [
29
,
30
]. 
Two families of nucleation temperatures are provided in Equations (5) and (6) where θ
n-
 is equal to two opposite values of θ
g
 because ε
gs
 is a function of θ

There are two methods to produce a glassy phase from an enthalpy coefficient equal to (−Δε). The first predicts the undercooling temperature for each value of Δε. These nucleation temperatures (θ

 = 1. For Δε = 0, a second order-like phase transition temperature takes place at T
g
 during heating for the minimum value of ε
gs0
. Values of 
θ
x
 for various values of Δ
ε
 are deduced for the same value of ε
gs0
. Consequently, Equation (6) demonstrates that enthalpy above 
θ
x
 is constant and equal to −Δ
ε
H
m
, belongs to a glassy fraction with a zero specific heat. The glass transition at (
T
n+
) is not accompanied during the first heating by the latent heat recovery (+Δ
ε
 H
m
). 
Glassy phases, formed at 
θ
x
 after undercooling, lead to glassy phase fractions which are volume fractions occupied by the glassy phases with 
θ
g
 = θ
n+
 =
 Δ
ε
 in agreement with Equation (6). It has been shown that the set theory provides clear evidence of structural differences between glasses and melts; both glassy and liquid structures near T
g
 are disordered, however they have different Hausdorff–Besicovitch dimensions [
54
]. The set theory, as a branch of mathematical logic that studies abstract sets, can be used to characterize the configuron phase formed in amorphous materials out of broken chemical bonds termed configurons. Glasses have a 3D geometry of bonds with point-type broken bonds with a 0D geometry and, because of that, they exhibit a solid-like behavior. The configuron phase behaves differently in glasses and melts, forming a condensed phase in melts and occurring as a gaseous phase in glasses. It therefore has different Hausdorff–Besicovitch dimensions in melts and glasses [
55
]. The stepwise change in the Hausdorff–Besicovitch dimension of the set of configurons is due to the formation of the macroscopic (condensed fractal cluster) configuron phase above the T
g
 and as a result has the appearance of a kink in the first sharp diffraction minimum of scattered X-ray or neutrons [
56
].
The formation of a glassy fraction is accompanied by a crystallized fraction (
1 −
 Δ
ε
). A composite crystal–glass is built below T
m
 with a melting enthalpy (
1 −
 Δ
ε
) H
m
 and a missing enthalpy (Δ
ε
 H
m
) recovered at 
T
n+
 [
23
]. The glassy phase fraction is not destroyed at T
m
 and depends on the sample thermal history and the last value of Δ
ε
 obtained at 
T
x
 during heating.
The minimum glass transition at T
g
 is masked by spontaneous crystallization of liquid element and determined with Equation (7) using Δε = 0 and the minimum value of ε
gso

In 
Figure 1
, a second method is used to calculate new values of 
θ
x
 during heating. Each value of 
θ
g
 varying from −0.5 to 2 corresponds to a value of 
T
g
/T
m
 between 0.5 and 3. All ratios 
T
g
/T

, represented in 
Figure 1
, would be those of phases resulting from a first-order transition at 
T
x
,
 with 
T
x
 and 
T
g
 depending on heating rates. Applying Equation (7) determines the value of ε
gs0
 = ε
ls0,
 (positive or negative [
23
]), for each (
θ
g
) and Δε = 0. Each first-order transition at 
θ
x
 respects Δ
ε = θ
n+
 = θ
g
 > 0, in agreement with Equation (6). Negative values of 
θ
g
 (
T
g
/T
m
 < 1) are higher than 
θ
x
 because 
T
g
/T
m
 is always higher than 
T
x
/T
m
. The values of (
θ
x
) obtained with Equation (7) are weaker than those predicted in 
Figure 1
 along the dashed curve.
The two lines between T
g
/T
m
 = 0.5 and 1.5 are symmetrical with respect to 1. There are five values of 
T
g
/T
m
 for 
T
x
/T
m
 higher than 0.7069, and three values of 
T
g
/T
m
 for 
T
x
/T
m
 < 0.7069, depending on the singular values of Δ
ε
 determined by each thermal history. For T
x
/T
m
 = 0.7069, T
g
/T
m
 = 1.475. Note that the NCHN model predicts nucleation temperatures at 
T
n+
 > 2 T

, ignoring the structure of these new ordered phases. We assume that glassy phases are formed.
Liquid-liquid transitions in bismuth were observed along lines (1,2,4,5) in 
Figure 1
, by several authors using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) or differential thermal analysis (DTA) at various heating rates. In fact, this leads to vitreous transitions at 
T
g
/T
m
 = 1.4291, 1.4384, 1.8675 and 2 for 
T
x
/T
m
 = 0.70811, 0.70767, 0.80681 and 1, respectively, without recovery of the endothermic heat (Δε H
m
) at these temperatures [
1
,
3
,
4
]. The value of ε
gs0
 for bismuth was equal to 0.1907 corresponding to δ
ls
 = 0.0912 [
23
]. 
The vertical lines (3,5) in 
Figure 1
 are those of tin and correspond to T
g
/T
m
 = 1.5523 (T
g
 = 783.9 K) and 2 (T
g
 = 2 T
m
). The horizontal line T
x
/T
m
 = 0.71022 determines T
g
/T
m
 = 1.5523. Two liquid-liquid transitions, occurring at T
g
/T
m
 = 1.5523 and 2 are known up until now. Only T
g
/T
m
 = 1.5523 is characterized as a glass transition [
5
]. 
The Bi glass transition was not reproduced at T
g
/T
m
 = 2 during cooling because all bonds were erased during heating far above T
g
/T
m
 = 2, as observed with the heating and cooling rates of 2 K/min [
4
] 
In contrast, the Sn transition at T
g
/T
m
 = 2.168, during heating, disappeared during cooling and gave rise to a new transition at T
g/
T
m
 = 1.832, characterizing a first-order transition at T
g
/T
m
 = 2, and observing that [(2.168 + 1.832)/2 = 2] with heating and cooling rates of 7.5 K/min [
3
]. The first-order transition at T
g
/T
m
 = 1.832 (T
g
 = 652 °C) was reproduced during the second heating and cooling at 10 °C/min and could correspond to Δε = 0.832. 
The resistivity measurements [
4
] after the second heating were much weaker than those obtained during the first heating of Sn and Bi. At the highest temperature T = 2.28 T
m
, the ordered fractions did not disappear because T
g
 is expected to be on the order of 3 T
m
. The resistivity decreases were equal to 22% for tin and 16.7% for Bi. 
We examine the case where the glassy phase is formed at 
T
x
. Characteristic values of Δ
ε
lg
 (
θ
) 
= −
Δ
ε
 at various temperatures 
T
x
 would correspond to various percolation thresholds of configurons. The enthalpy coefficient (Δε
lg
 = −Δε) of Phase 3 is constant up to T
n+
 = T
g
. The transition at T
g
 leads to a new liquid state with Δε
lg
 linearly decreasing with temperature in agreement with Equation (6). Consequently, the melt-specific heat, being proportional to the derivative (Δε
lg
/dT), undergoes a jump equal to Δ
ε
 H
m
/T
m
 at T
g
 = T
n+
. 
The weakest glass transition temperature of bismuth was predicted at T
g
 = 202.46 K [
23
]. The singular enthalpy coefficients Δ
ε
 were determined: Δε
lg
 = 0, Δε
lg0
 = 0.1907, −Δε
lg
 (θ
g
) = 0.094065, −Δε
lg
 (θ
0m
 = −2/3) = 0.10594, −Δε
lg
 (θ = −1) = 0.238375 and Δε
lg
 = −1. The experimental coefficients (Δε) giving rise to θ
n+
 = 778/544.5 −1 = 0.429 and 784.6/544.5 −1 = 0.44096 were obtained with a heating rate of 5 K/min and were nearly equal to the theoretical values (0.42908 = 0.1907 + 0.23838) and (0.43838 = 0.094065 + 0.10594 + 0.23838) [
1
]. In 
Figure 2
, these two transitions are nucleated at T
x
 = 286.2 and 288 K during undercooling. Only the transition at T = 286.2 K is represented, leading to the horizontal line (2) up to T
g
 = 778.1 K. The observed coefficient Δε = 0.8675 [
3
], nucleated at T = 370 K, was equal to the sum (0.42908 + 0.43838) up to T
g
 = 1016 K along Line (3) [
23
]. The coefficient (Δε = 1) along Line (4), nucleated at 395 K, without crystallization at T
m
, disappears at T
g
 = 2 T
m
 = 1089 K. We expect, by reversing heating to cooling at a reduced temperature slightly lower than T
g
, that the enthalpy coefficient Δε
lg
 = −Δε will fall to zero after an incubation time, starting from a glassy fraction equal to Δε.
The enthalpy coefficient variation of Phase 3 along Line (5) in 
Figure 2
, obeying to Equation (6), is obtained after a transition at 
T
g
 = T
n+
 followed by continuous heating through the various glass transitions. The latent heat (Δ
ε
 H
m
) would be recovered by reversing heating to cooling slightly below 
T
g
. 
The weakest glass transition temperature of tin is T
g
 = 185.2 K (θ
g
 = −0.63332), applying Equations (7) and (8) for Δε
gs0
 = 0.167, (δ
ls
 = 0.08028). The singular enthalpy coefficients of liquid tin are Δε
lg
 = 0, Δε
lg0
 = 0.167, −Δε
lg
 (θ
g
) = 0.08373, −Δε
lg
 (θ
0m
 = −2/3) = 0.09278, −Δε
lg
 (θ = −1) = 0.20875 and −Δε
lg
 = 1. A sum of all basic coefficients leads to Δε = 0.5523. Here, too, the combination of singular enthalpy coefficients determines the glass transition at T
g
/T
m
. 
In 
Figure 3
, the transition occurring at T
x
 = 284 K (θ
x
 = −0.43757) gives rise to a glassy fraction f = 0.5523 and a glass transition at T
g
/T
m
 = 1.5523 (T
g
 = 783.9 K) calculated with ε
gs0
 = 0.167 and Equations (6) and (7). The temperature (284 K) separates two crystalline phases corresponding to gray and white tin. The temperature T
x
 = 284 K, corresponding to the melting temperature T
m
 ≅ 284 K of gray tin, is difficult to observe because of the concomitant formation of a glass phase at the same temperature [
57
]. Above 284 K, the liquid fraction of gray phase is a glass with T
g
 = 783.9 K, coexisting with a crystallized fraction (1 − 0.5523 = 0.4477) of white tin up to T
m
. A glass transition temperature was observed in tin at T
g
 ≅ 780 K, confirming the existence of a glassy fraction above T
m
 [
5
]. The glassy phase corresponding to f = Δε = 1 would be nucleated at T
x
 = 366.7 K and heated without crystallization at T
m
, up to T
g
 = 2 T
m
 = 1010 K. We will see that the glass transition at 1010 K observed by resistivity measurements is reversible [
4
].
As a conclusion of this chapter, the existence of singular glassy fractions (f) in liquid Bi and Sn is predicted. Liquid-liquid transitions are observed and occur at the predicted glass transition temperatures. The latent heat (Δε H
m
) is absent during heating as expected for glass transitions and could be present by reversing heating to cooling slightly below T
g
.
Density varies linearly with increasing temperature, 
T
 (K), above T

where d

 is a density at 0 K. In general, density measurements were made after melting the crystalline phase in the absence of temperature T
x
 resulting from undercooling and reheating. Nevertheless, liquid-liquid transitions were observed with heating rates between 0.1 and 20 °C/min at temperatures (
T
n+
) [
23
]. Consequently, new atomic bonds are induced by relaxation of liquid state near 
T
n+
 [
22
]. The singular coefficient Δ
ε
 belonging to lower enthalpy phases determines the temperature 
T
n+

g
. Bond formation gives rise, at very low heating rate, to weak endothermic latent heat, dispersing the liquid density measurements above T
m
. Density, 
d
, is expected to be reduced for bismuth and increased for tin by this enthalpy relaxation up to T
g
 = 2 T

. Then, Equation (9) can be written as a function of

Density measurements would lead to dispersed results because they would be dependent on the measurement time and on the amplitude of the relaxed enthalpy. 
The specific heat of bismuth above T
m
, measured point after point [
62
], is strongly dispersed as reproduced in 
Figure 4
. Few singular values of T
n+
 are indicated. The deepest one occurs at 862 K (Δε = 2 × 0.23838 + 0.10594 = 0.5827) and the highest ones at 1017 K (Δε = 0.8675) and 1089 K (Δε = 1). The specific heat (0.147 J/K/g) at T
m
 is recovered at 1180 K showing that the transition width at 1089 K is about 100 K in this case. These results show that the dispersion of measurements attains 12%, and that these weak glassy fractions induced by relaxation have glass transition temperatures equal to 
T
n
+
. Consequently, liquid-liquid transitions observed around each temperature T
n+
 would correspond to fractions much weaker than the singular value (Δ
ε
) associated with T
n+
 Dispersion is expected for density measurements below the line defined by Equation (9). 
The density of liquid bismuth was measured by gamma attenuation from the melting point to 1000 °C in discrete steps of 5 °C and reproduced in 
Figure 5
 [
3
]. Values of density were stabilized at singular coefficients, 0.42908, 0.8093 and 0.90594, each of them being a sum of basic coefficients corresponding to a glassy phase. A transition between 0.8093 and 0.90594, occurring at 1.8675 T
m
 (743.8 °C) was observed by DTA at 0.1 °C/min.
The density change at T
m
 corresponds to a melting heat of 1.23838 H
m
 instead of H
m
, because it contains the enthalpy (0.23838 H
m
) provided by Equation (4), which corresponds to the initial formation of Phase 3 for T
g
/T
m
 = 1 as shown in 
Figure 1
. There is no visible transition in 
Figure 5
 at T = 2 T
m
 as shown by the quasi-continuity of the density. 
The density of tin is represented by Lines (1–3) in 
Figure 6
: solid tin, Line (1) [
60
], and liquid tin, Lines (2) [
59
] and (3) [
63
]. Lines (2,3) are chosen among measurements with only 50 kg/m
3
 of error reviewed by Alchagirov and Chochaeva [
59
]. The difference in density, 82 kg/m
3
 at 2 T
m
 is higher than the measurement error. Lines (2,3) could represent two liquid densities that are parallel and separated by approximately 75 kg/m
3
 or less inside the measurement error. This phenomenon, if confirmed, would be associated with the presence of a weak glassy fraction f << 0.20875 from 0 K to 2 T
m
 and beyond as predicted. The density change at T
m
 and the melting heat depend on the thermal history and may include glassy fractions that are melted at very high temperatures beyond 3 T
m
 as predicted by the glassy phase diagram. 
The specific heat (
C
p
) is reduced by a contribution (Δ

m
 leading to 10,662 J/mole inside an uncertainty of measurements varying from 10,480 to 11,300 J/mole [
68
]. 
The constants 28.43 and 30.2 J/K/mole are values of 
C
p
 at T
m
 in the absence of glassy phases. These heat capacities are equal to zero at T = 2 T
m
 and to 28.43 and 30.2 J/mole at temperatures higher than 2 T
m
 as shown for Sn and Bi in 
Figure 7
 and 
Figure 8
. When a fraction (f) of liquid is no longer in a glassy state above the temperature (
T
), (
C
p
) linearly decreases from 28.43 for Sn to zero and from 30.2 J/K/mole to zero for Bi. These specific heat variations, expected during heating, are plotted as a function of temperature for Sn and Bi in 
Figure 7
 and 
Figure 8
 without latent heat recovery as expected for glass transitions.
A glass transition was detected for the first time around 783.9 K in agreement with our predictions [
5
]. This transition induced a specific heat jump of about 1.8 J/K/mole instead of 28.4 J/K/mole corresponding to a glassy fraction f ≅ 1.8/28.4 = 6.3%. This glassy fraction was induced in a “stepwise-scanning mode: the temperature during the thermal equilibration stage changed with time and gradually approached a constant value in about 60 min”. The peak of Δ
C
p
,
 observed during this slow heating, accompanied by critical phenomena, could be attributed to the thermodynamic transition of configurons [
33
,
69
]. The jump of Δ
C
p
 measured at 4 K/min was weaker because the nucleation time of new bonds was much lower.
DTA at 0.1 °C/min reveals an endothermic latent heat of the order of 20 to 100 J/mole [
3
] at T
g
 =1.8675 T
m
. A transition width (ΔT) of 200 K was observed at 1089 K by resistivity measurements with 2 °C/min and a width (ΔT = 10 K) expected for R = 0.1 °C/min [
4
]. We attribute this liquid-liquid transition to a glassy fraction transition of the order of 6.6% with 20 J/mole and 33% with 100 J/mole] assuming a transition width of 10 K. A second endothermic heat was observed by DTA at T = 2 T
m
 = 1089 K corresponding to a second glass transition and to the enthalpy relaxed during 720 min between 1017 and 1089 K. 
Configuron thermodynamic transition was revealed by structural changes at the glass transition via radial distribution functions [
56
,
70
]. The first sharp diffraction minimum in the pair distribution function was shown to contain information on structural changes in amorphous materials at the glass transition temperature (T
g
). An additional feature of such configuron transition was determined by measuring the temperature dependence of the structure factor of molten bismuth, 
−S(q)
” [
3
]. The authors observed, in their neutron diffraction analysis, an additional feature in the measurement that appeared around the melting temperature of bismuth. “Pair distribution function curves (
g(r)
) were calculated for each (
S(q))
 measurement”. “At and above melting, both the 
S(q)
 and 
g(r)
 curves were characterized by a shoulder located on the high q and r side of the first peak, respectively”. The temperature dependence of the coordination numbers lead to the number of atoms contributed by the shoulder, 
N
Shoulder
(T). The derivative of 
N
Shoulder
 with respect to temperature, showed a discontinuity at the transition point at 1089 K, and was associated with this temperature-driven transformation and a structural change. This structural change is a signature of the thermodynamic transition of configurons [
33
].
DSC revealed that C
p
 was equal to zero at 1070 °C with a heating rate of 20 °C/min [
4
]. From our model, we deduce that the glassy fraction (f) was 100%. The liquidus temperature of this alloy is 425 °C (698 K). The glass transition, occurring at 1070 °C (1343 K), was weaker than 2 T
m
 = 1396 K. The specific heat increased from 1070 °C to 1123 °C without latent heat. The transition width (2000 K) is expected to be 10 times wider than at 2 K/min. Consequently, the recovery of Δ
C
p
, for a temperature increase of 53 K, is of the order of 53/2000 ≅ 2.6% of its value at T
m
. We conclude that the glassy fraction (f = 100%) was induced at a temperature 
T
x
 < T
m
. As a result, the rapid increase of the heating rate would have to induce the first order transition at 
T
x
 < T
m
. This experiment showed for the first time that a glassy phase of 100% can be obtained with a heating rate of 20 K/min. The latent heat equal to H
m
 is not recovered as predicted in 
Figure 7
.
An internal friction method was used to study the structural changes of InSn80 wt% [
71
]. This alloy has a melting temperature of about 190°C (463 K) and a glass transition temperature expected at 2 T
m
 = 926 K (653 °C). A minimum of internal friction occurs at 625 °C and a maximum at 700 °C. Based on the results of a diffraction experiment around 700 °C, the liquid structures before and after the peak are very different [
4
]. “Before the change, there are residual covalent bonds of solid tin in the melt and during the transition, the residual bonds are broken and at the same time, new atomic bonds build up, with a relatively uniform melt forming”. This description provided by [
4
] is known to be due to the percolation threshold of configurons [
33
].
This eutectic composition has a melting temperature of 183 °C (456 K). The highest glass transition temperature is predicted at 912 K (639 °C). The internal friction has a maximum at 670 °C and a minimum at 560 °C with a heating rate of 2.5 °C/min and a maximum at 712 °C and a minimum at 600 °C with 6 °C/min. This liquid-liquid transition temperature increases with the heating rate as observed in all glasses [
4
]. 
A process was described by Zu F.Q. [
4
], ignoring at this time that resistivity decreases could be due to the formation of glassy fractions, added after several cooling cycles to various temperatures 
T
x
 < T
m
, followed by successive reheating as shown in 
Figure 9
. Each value of 
T
x
/T
m
 < 0.7069 lead to a glass transition much higher than 2 T
m
 as shown by the glassy phase diagram of 
Figure 1
. These various reheating cycles enriched the total glassy fraction as shown by resistivity reductions of 40% after three heating of Cu-Sb76.5 wt%, of 22% in tin and 16.7% in bismuth after two heating cycles. In addition, depending on heating rate, another glass transition occurs at T
m
 < 
T
n+
 < 2 T
m
 in various alloys such as InSn80 wt%, InBi32 wt% at R = 3 °C/min and CuSb76.5 wt% at 5 °C/min. They were due to the formation of very weak glassy fractions (
f
), depending on heating and cooling rates. The residual resistivity is equal to 100 µΩ·cm at T
m
 during the first heating. Consequently, the formation of high glassy fractions with 
T
g
 >> 2 T
m
 could be attained after adding new thermal cycles, leading to a maximum resistivity fall. Reheating cycles could stabilize the glassy phase above (T
n+
 = 2 T
m
). 
Liquid-liquid transitions are observed below and above T
m
. 
First-order transitions, predicted by the NCHN model, occur at 
T
x
 < T
m
, building glassy phase fractions (
f =
 Δ
ε
) and crystallized fractions (
1 −
 Δ
ε
) after supercooling the melt. Melting of glassy fractions occurs at temperatures 
T
n+
 > T
m
 at the percolation threshold of bonds. One of them induces a glass enthalpy equal to the melting enthalpy (Δε = 1) and a zero specific heat, without crystallized fraction, up to the glass transition (T
g
 = 2 T
m
). All glassy fractions are expected to have enthalpies equal to zero, after reversing heating to cooling below T
n+
 and a long time of incubation at a temperature close to T
g
. 
Liquid-liquid transitions between the melting temperature (T
m
) and (2 T
m
) are observed in the absence of first order transition at 
T
x
 < T
m
 and are reminiscent of glassy fractions (
f
) formed at temperatures (
T
x
) weaker than (T
m
) through first-order transitions. These weak fractions correspond to singular values (Δ
ε
) of enthalpy coefficients (Δ
ε
lg
 (θ) = −
Δ
ε
) of a new phase called “Phase 3”, and to typical percolation thresholds of configurons at various temperatures (
T
n+
 = T
g
). These fractions are slowly induced near (
T
n+
) by relaxation in the absence of first order transition prior to melting.
All these liquid-liquid transitions above T
m
 are glass transitions. 
Several situations are encountered in bismuth and tin:
(1)
After melting Bi and Sn at T = T
m
, weak fractions (
f
) were built by slow heating (0.1 °C/min for Bi and one hour between each measurement for Sn) and melted at

/T
m
 = Δ
ε
. Liquid-liquid transitions were observed at 1.8675 T
m
 for bismuth and 1.5523 T
m
 for Sn. The glassy character of these transitions is confirmed by structural transitions that we attribute to the melting of configurons. An observed glass transition in Sn was also characterized by a weak specific heat jump predicted by the NCHN model and a peak at 1.5523 T
m
 due to the thermodynamic character of a transition obeying critical exponents associated with configuron percolation. There is no endothermic latent heat (Δ
ε
 H
m
) during heating.
(2)
After melting Bi and Sn at T = T
m
, transitions were also observed at T = 2 T
m
 by DTA and (or) resistivity that we consider as new glass transitions. The transition was reversible only for Sn. A weak endothermic heat instead of H
m
 was observed for Bi at 2 T
m
. The glassy states of Bi and Sn could have a density equal to that of the liquid at T
m
 only after reversing heating to cooling and a long incubation time close to T
m
.
(3)
After melting Bi at T = T
m
, high-resolution measurements of the density showed the existence of singular values corresponding to those of the enthalpy of Phase 3. The melting heat at T
m
 corresponds to 1.23838 H
m
 instead of H
m
 including, in addition, the latent heat of glassy phase as predicted by the NCHN model.
(4)
A glassy phase diagram is proposed for systems having their lowest transition determined by their Lindemann coefficients. Each first order transition at 
T
x
 < T
m
 leads to multiple glass transitions. The possible existence of weak glassy fractions (f) for 
T
x
/T
m
 < 0.7069, with glass transition temperatures much higher than (2 T
m
) is envisaged (beyond (3 T
m
) for 
f
 < 22.45%). Resistivity measurements showed decreases in Bi and Sn from T
m
 to 2 T
m
 and beyond, after thermal cycling between undercooled liquid and solid states.

T

 are accompanied by latent heats, without being recovered at

 ≤ 2 T

. The heat capacity linearly decreases down to zero when Δ

 increases up to 1 (T
n+

m
). An enthalpy equal to zero, down to T
m
, would be induced by reversing heating to cooling from a temperature slightly weaker than 
T
g
 = T
n+
. We show, for the first time, that the liquid-specific heat is constant between T
m
 and 2 T
m
 in the absence of glassy phase.

The stability of glassy fractions for 
T

/T
m
 < 0.7069 can be very high because their (
T

f

f
 ≤ 100%.
