 to the quasi-stationary strain rate that has been reported for coarse-grained materials with high fraction of low-angle boundaries; this suggests that dynamic recovery of dislocations is generally mediated by boundaries. The influence of anelastic back flow on

 related with generation and storage of dislocations; its activation volume is in the order expected from the classical theory of thermal glide.
In materials science one is used to think in terms of strain hardening and recovery: The dislocation density increases with plastic strain so that the material hardens; recovery decreases this density with time so that the material softens. However, this view is too simple as the recovery processes get biased under stress so that dynamic recovery, i.e., recovery under stress, also causes strain. Recovery by cross slip is an early and well known example. When the rate of strain due to recovery decreases, the material may seem to harden even though it recovers. The present work deals with this surprising effect in an ultrafine-grained material with high content of high-angle boundaries (HABs).
In a companion paper the quasi-stationary (qs) deformation strength of ultrafine-grained (ufg) Cu–Zr has been described. In qs deformation storage and recovery of dislocations approximately balance each other so that the dislocation density 


ρ


 remains approximately constant, i.e.,
Storage occurs after expansion of dislocation loops on slip planes (
Figure 1
: ’dislocations in’). Dynamic recovery is coagulation of dislocation loops after dipole capture (
Figure 1
: ’dislocations out’). The recovery processes may be spatially concentrated at crystallite boundaries or may be more equally distributed as in solid solutions of class I-type with solute drag on dislocations [
1
,
2
]. Recovery generally requires dislocation motion outside the primary slip plane by climb or cross slip [
3
].
In the view in a direction parallel to the glide plane, where dislocations appear as points (
Figure 1
), recovery seems to make a negligible contribution to strain during annihilation of dislocation dipoles. Therefore, dynamic recovery is usually not considered as a process generating strain. Rather, the models regard strain as a result of thermally activated expansion of slipped areas bounded by dislocation lines with positive curvature that have to overcome a significant athermal stress component (forest dislocations, long-range back stresses from boundaries). In this picture the existing dislocations act as 
obstacles
 to dislocation glide. However, the view in a direction perpendicular to the slip plane shows that strain may well be generated during the process of coagulation of dislocation loops in recovery as negatively curved dislocation segments straighten [
4
,
5
]. Here, the interaction of dislocations 
supports
 the expansion of slipped areas by glide rather than opposing it. The difference in driving forces means that the kinetics of generation of dislocation length by glide of positively curved dislocations moving through the existing dislocation structure differs from that of decrease of dislocation length by motion of negatively curved dislocations. Therefore, it makes sense to treat the rate

In the literature, there are a couple of examples of processes of type

,

], accommodation processes at HABs [
10
], strain coupled with migration of LABs (e.g., [
11
]) and HABs (e.g., [

 the recovery–strain rate

 has received little attention (see e.g., [

13
]). In monotonic qs deformation, the two terms 






ϵ


˙




+




 and 






ϵ


˙




−




 are coupled via condition Equation 
1
. To investigate recovery of dislocation lines separately from storage of dislocations, one must decouple the two processes. This can be done by perturbing monotonic flow by a sudden change of the force 
F
 at which the specimen deforms. Such a perturbation abruptly changes the forces exerted per length of dislocations and triggers reversible time-dependent dislocation motions (e.g., bowing/unbowing). The strains caused by those motions are called anelastic. So the total inelastic strain rate is

. Anelastic strains are negligible. Just after the

].
Now we consider relatively large 
F
-changes (cases c and d in 
Figure 2
). Anelastic strains are no longer negligible and diminish 






ϵ


˙




inel




 compared to 






ϵ


˙




pl




 (Equation (

)). At sufficiently low 
R
, the forces acting on the dislocations initially get negative so that 






ϵ


˙




inel




 becomes negative directly after the 
R
-reduction [
17
]. This is a consequence of internal stresses of short- and long-range nature acting on the dislocations [
17
] and opposing thermally activated glide of type 






ϵ


˙




+




. As the back flow relaxes the internal back stresses created before the 
R
-reduction, the absolute magnitude of the rate

 declines, 






ϵ

 becomes dominant again, and forward deformation is reestablished at a rate

. The preceding anelastic back flow is expected to cause only subtle changes of the dislocation arrangement and the rest of the microstructure; therefore, the rate 






ϵ


˙






r


,


2






, measured short after the period of back flow, has also been adressed as ’constant structure’ rate. However, it is clear that this is not fully correct (see Equation (4)).
In the further course of the transient after large 
R
-reductions, 






ϵ


˙




anel




 becomes negligible so that 








ϵ


˙




inel




≈






ϵ

pl






. A remarkable result is that 






ϵ


˙




inel




 generally 
decreases
 for long times as schematically indicated by the dashed curve. This behavior is not well known in the community, although it is regularly found whenever investigated, independent of materials and pretreatment. It is distinct from the so-called inverse transient behavior where the decrease of 






ϵ


˙




inel




 with strain after 
R
-reduction occurs in the whole interval 




0


<


R


<


1




, and not only at small 
R
. One reason for the lack of knowledge about decreasing 






ϵ


˙




inel




 after large 
R
-reductions is, that long-term tests are required for such observations, covering test times distinctly beyond the extended period of back flow. Such tests have been done by Blum and coworkers on a number of materials including e.g., Al–5Mg (class I alloy) [
18
,
19
], Al–Zn (class II alloy) [
20
], and pure LiF [
21
] and by Van Swygenhoven and coworkers on nanocrystalline Ni and Ni-Fe [
10
,
22
,
23
]. In these tests direct evidence for ongoing net recovery of dislocations was obtained. A natural explanation of the decrease of 






ϵ


˙




inel




 after perturbation of plastic flow by a large 
R
-reduction is that the recovery rate component 






ϵ


˙




−




 decreases, because the driving force for recovery declines during the decrease of 


ρ


 and other crystal defects to the lower level in the new qs state at the lower stress.
The same process of net recovery must also be expected when a deformed specimen is simply unloaded to 




R


=


0




 and subsequently annealed at elevated temperature higher than the deformation temperature. This type of experiment has been done by Hasegawa, Yakou and Kocks on pure Al [
24
,
25
] that was deformed at ambient temperature and then quickly heated to elevated temperature. The result was qualitatively the same as the result of unloading at fixed temperature described before: net 
back
 flow due to anelastic strains was followed by net 
forward
 flow at declining rate. This forward flow at zero stress after predeformation was interpreted by the authors as consequence of recovery; the recovery was suggested to result from reaction of neighboring polarized dislocation walls.
So far, comprehensive studies of the transient response to stress reductions are missing in the case of ECAP-processed ufg materials. Two tests performed on ufg Cu [
26
] showed a decrease of creep rate after relative stress reductions to 




R


=


0.77




 and 0.70 that could be explained in terms of decreasing recovery–strain rate. The present study of transient deformation after qs deformation of ufg Cu–Zr has these main objectives:
demonstrate that the transient response to load changes can be studied in standard tensile creep machines with load control,
advertise a new type of plot [
27
] (
Figure 3
e) displaying the full strain-time evolutions of all tests of a series with different degrees of unloading at reasonable resolution,
show that the transient behavior of an ufg material is qualitatively the same as that of cg materials, including an initial period of strain mainly due to recovery,
discuss the mechanism of dynamic recovery in qs and transient deformation with special regard to the influence of internal stresses.

 load, not for precisely following small strain changes after load changes. The reproducibility of measurements of back flow was worse than in Milička’s tests [
14
,
15
,
16
], but better than originally expected, although some artifacts from unmotivated jumps in the extensometer system or errors in 




σ

 occasionally seem to have occurred (see e.g., the black curve in 
Figure 3
b after unloading). In the periods of deformation (creep) at constant load the inelastic strain rate is practically identical to the measured total strain rate

Figure 3
a–c shows three tests with relative load reductions to by 60% to

Figure 3

Figure 3
b). However, the strains accumulated there were small and no significant effect on the values of

R

Figure 3
b).

inel




 is large, because relatively small strain intervals

inel




 (compare Equation (

Two of the

Figure 3
c still appear somewhat noisy. Yet further smoothing of data was avoided because the 






ϵ


˙




inel




-variations seem to have a real origin in slow 
T
-fluctuations caused by the control system. The two gray curves for 8Cu–Zr in subfigure b show the measured 






ϵ


˙




inel




-extremes. They differ by a factor of 3 to 4 in 






ϵ


˙




inel




. We ascribe that to the aforementioned inhomogeneity of the grain structure of 8Cu–Zr. The upper gray curve for 8Cu–Zr is quite similar to the black curve for 12Cu–Zr. We conclude from this result that, apart from the scatter of the initial microstructure produced by the thermomechanical history, there is no significant difference between the ufg materials 8Cu–Zr and 12Cu–Zr.
Figure 3
d-f gives the overview of all 
R
-reduction tests performed in this work. Again, we focus on the forward flow observed 
after
 the anelastic back flow. The curves in 
Figure 3
f derived from 
Figure 3
e are arranged in a fairly consistent sequence corresponding to the loads shown in 
Figure 3
d. This underscores the quality of the length measurements in our creep machines although these were not built for load change tests. For 




R


≤


0.3




 a transient decrease of the (forward) strain rate 








ϵ


˙




inel




>

 is evident.
Figure 4
 shows the times 




t


back




 (circles) for anelastic back flow taken from the length-time recordings. Due to differences in unloading histories and uncertainties in length measurement the scatter is large. The dashed line corresponds to the dashed curve from 
Figure 3
f approximating the boundary of back flow. For 




R


>


0.75




 the time interval of back flow is immeasurably small. So back flow becomes negligible here and deformation goes on at positive rate directly after the load reduction.
Dislocation generation needs strain. Therefore, the strain 




ϵ


inel




 is much more closely related to the microstructural evolution than the testing time 
t
. So the evolution of deformation strength 




(


σ


,






ϵ


˙




inel




)




 is commonly displayed on a strain scale. 
Figure 5
 exhibits the transients of 
Figure 3
f as function of 




ϵ


inel




. As 


σ


 increases at constant load 
F
, 






ϵ


˙




inel




 increases even if the microstructure is constant. This effect was eliminated by correcting 






ϵ


˙




inel




 (see caption). The corrected curves in 
Figure 5
 should be horizontal in the qs state if the grain and phase structure remains constant. This is indeed found for large 
R
 near 1. For smaller 
R
 the curves exhibit a positive slope in the whole strain interval. This means that slow microstructural changes are going on throughout the test. Comparison of the dotted and the solid curves at 




R


=


0.4




 and 0.3 shows that these changes are the same in tests with and without 
R
-reduction. At the lowest 
R
 of 0.2 (80% unloading) deformation is slowest and the structural changes including dislocations are largest. Consequently, softening is most pronounced here. The curve for 




R


=


0.2




 was followed for 42 days before it was interrupted without any indications of fracture; note that the 




ϵ


˙




(


ϵ


) curve is concave, not convex as in fracture. In [
28
] the softening has been shown to be a consequence of microstructural coarsening, in particular grain coarsening. This means that only the short-term portions of the curves after 
R
-reduction show the transient response to perturbance of the dynamic equilibrium of storage and recovery of dislocations in the qs state at 




t


0




.
Note that the character of this short-term portion of the transients changes significantly with

 there is a relative

Our results for ufg Cu–Zr are qualitatively quite similar to the general behavior observed for crystalline materials after a perturbation of monotonic plastic flow by load changes. For small 
R
-reductions deformation goes on at reduced rate in forward direction according to the applied stress and the material softens with strain in parallel to the recovery of the dislocation structure. For large 
R
-reductions deformation first goes backward before it returns to positive direction again and then continues at decreasing rate. As mentioned in Equation (
1
), this rate decrease parallels that of recovery and therefore may be directly linked to dynamic recovery. This can be understood from the view that the strain rate term 






ϵ


˙




+




 leading to storage of dislocations disappears for small 
R
 so that the strain rate term 






ϵ


˙




−




 related with dynamic recovery dominates. These transient phenomena disappear while the new qs state corresponding to 
R
 is approached.
The two terms 






ϵ


˙




+




 and 






ϵ


˙




−




, corresponding to the cases ’dislocations in’ and ’dislocations out’ of 
Figure 1
, have different kinetics. This difference should become apparent in those ranges of 
R
 where either 






ϵ

 or 






ϵ

−




 dominate. This is in line with the different 
R
-dependences of the lines for 






ϵ

 and 






ϵ

−




 in 
Figure 6
b. Milička [

,
15
,
16
] restricted his measurements to the 
R
-range with 








ϵ


˙






r

≥

. In spite of this restriction, he discovered that a single mechanism of deformation obeying Equation (
4

ϵ


˙

,


1






 with 
R
. So he proposed to express 






ϵ


˙






r

 as a sum of two terms [

16
]. This parallels the separation of 






ϵ

 into

From the preceding discussion we surmise that for

 the rate

 in terms of the classical theory of thermally activated glide over fixed repulsive obstacles in pure materials (e.g., forest dislocations) may be possible.
We now turn attention to the recovery–strain rate

. So far there is no accepted detailed model of dynamic recovery and its strain rate contribution 






ϵ


˙




−




. Strain contributions from recovery of individual dislocations stored at recovery sites, probably internal crystal boundaries (LABs, HABs), and from recovery of boundaries by migration need to be considered.
One may ask to which extent the recovery–strain rate gets reduced in the period of back flow before 






ϵ


˙






r


,


2






 is measured. It is clear that anelastic back flow relaxes internal stresses. Also, some fast recovery processes of the kind shown in 
Figure 1
 will happen already during the period of net back flow and thereby reduce the density of recovery sites. This indicates that use of the term ’constant structure’ for 






ϵ


˙




cs


−




 becomes increasingly problematic with declining 
R
 with regard to the dislocation structure and raises the question whether the constant structure assumption is wrong and anelastic back flow may even be lasting long enough to modify not only the internal stresses, but also allow the dislocation structure to evolve close to the new qs state at reduced stress. In this case 






ϵ


˙






r


,


2






 should become equal to the qs rate 






ϵ


˙




qs




 for low 
R
 and correspondingly low stresses. And this is in fact observed around 100 


M




Pa


, as 
Figure 7
a shows. To answer the question we estimate a lower limit 




t


rec


′




 of the time 




t


rec




 for full recovery into the new qs state. The estimate is based on the assumptions that (i) no dislocation generation takes place during the anelastic back flow even though the new qs state is based on dynamic equilibrium of generation and recovery and (ii) the maximal rate of dislocation recovery pertains throughout the back flow period even though the driving force for recovery must decrease. In the literature there is very little direct information on the evolution of the density 


ρ


 of dislocations during dynamic recovery. The reasons are that dynamic recovery is generally accompanied by dislocation glide of type 






ϵ


˙




+




 and that reliable observations can only be made if the dislocations can safely be pinned up to microscopic observation. A set of data was measured in [

The results of the present work do not allow us to deduce details about the mechanism of recovery–strain. Cross slip [
31
] and climb [
32
] are generally being considered as rate-controlling mechanisms (compare [
3
]). Stress concentrations at boundaries by long-range internal stresses have been used in descriptions of kinetics with the composite model [
33
]. LABs in coarse-grained materials [
11
,
21
] and of HABs in nanocrystalline materials [
34
] are being discussed as sinks of dislocations as well as of boundaries themselves (via recombination during migration). Measurements on single-crystalline LiF have led to the conclusion that migration of LABs is responsible for most or even all of the observed recovery strain [
21
]. (A different situation is encountered in class II alloys like Al–Mg with viscous dislocation glide due to strong solute drag and spatially homogeneous distribution of recovery events [
2
,
18
,
19
,
35
]; here long-range stresses seem to play only little role.) The insensitivity of the relative recovery–strain contribution of recovery in the qs state to the boundary misorientation is intriguing. The observation that LABs are the major carriers of recovery strain in coarse-grained (cg) materials means that generation of recovery–strain by annihilation of single dislocations (
Figure 1
) cannot be used to explain the recovery strain in both LAB- and HAB-dominated structures. A boundary-mediated recovery mechanism, however, may be valid in both cases. It could mean that the rates of dynamic recovery vary with the HAB-content, but the basic mechanism involving free dislocations and boundaries is the same.
Better understanding of recovery–strain may be of profound value in technical application of strong materials under conditions of varying stress 


σ


, e.g., in stress relaxation and cyclic deformation. The period of dominant recovery–strain rate 






ϵ


˙




−




 after load reductions gives the unique chance to investigate the kinetics of dynamic recovery alone without influence of the storage strain rate 






ϵ


˙




+




. One option is to perform 
secondary
 load change tests in this period after a primary large load reduction. Such secondary load changes have been started on Al [
36
] and recently continued on nc Ni [
22
,
23
]. The stress sensitivity in the period of 






ϵ


˙




qs


−




-dominance was found to be much smaller than the qs stress sensitivity 




n


qs




. Another option is to develop a 
model
 of dynamic recovery describing both the stress dependences of 








ϵ

(

 at constant structure and of 






ϵ


˙




qs


−




 in the qs state.
An obvious question to be answered by a model is why the recovery–strain rate 






ϵ


˙




cs


−




 at constant structure is so similar to the qs strain rate 






ϵ


˙




qs




 (
Figure 7
a). At least part of the answer seems to lie in internal stresses [
37
]. It is probable that recovery processes are concentrated at relatively hard regions, in particular crystallite boundaries, where the local stress 




σ


h




 is enhanced relative to the applied stress by a local forward stress 




σ


f




. In the following we apply the phenomenological approach used in [

qs

 shows the recovery–strain rate expected in the qs state, if the ratio

 is independent of stress as suggested by numerous results obtained for cg materials. It is seen that although the relaxation of the internal stresses during back flow may be significant, it always keeps the recovery–strain rate generated from the dense defect structure at high stress 




σ




r


,


0






 above the qs strain rate expected at the lower stresses acting at 




R


<


1




 where the qs defect density is much lower. That makes sense. The preceding exercise shows that the measured constant structure recovery–strain rates can be understood on the basis of internal forward stresses of some kind acting at the recovery sites. It must, however, naturally be expected that the decrease of the volume density of recovery sites during back flow also contributes to the decline of 






ϵ

Figure 7
.
One problem with measuring the recovery–strain rate 






ϵ


˙




−




 is that its separation from 






ϵ


˙




+




 in load/stress change tests is not trivial and sometimes impossible. The separation is easy and accurate if the inflection point in the semilogarithmic 






ϵ


˙






r


,


2






-curve (
Figure 6
b) is well pronounced. This depends strongly on the slope of this curve at 




R


=


1




. This slope is mostly given by the stress exponent 




n


cs


+




 of 






ϵ


˙




+




 (see Equation 
A15
), i.e., the rate associated with generation of defects leading to work hardening. According to the estimate of Equation 
A14 




n


cs


+




 decreases inversely proportional to the temperature 
T
.
On the other hand, the slope of the 






ϵ


˙




−




-curve due to recovery is rather insensitive to 
T
. Therefore, the separation of 






ϵ


˙




−




 becomes increasingly problematic when 
T
 increases. Solid solution strengthening leads to further reduction of 




n


cs


+




 and the inflection point in the semilogarithmic 






ϵ


˙






r


,


2






-curve (
Figure 6
b) may disappear completely (e.g., in Al–5Mg [
14
,
19
] and Fe–Si [
15
]. Then the separation of 






ϵ


˙




+




 and 






ϵ


˙




−




 may be based on the fact that 






ϵ


˙




+




 is driven by a thermal stress component 
lower
 than the applied stress, whereas 






ϵ


˙




−




 is driven by a local stress that is 
enhanced
 by the interaction of the recovering defects; this is an open task.

The recovery–strain rate

. This fraction for ufg Cu–Zr with high volume fraction of HABs is similar to the one commonly reported for cg materials with high volume fraction of LABs. That could mean that boundaries play qualitatively similar roles in mediating dynamic recovery independent of their misorientation.
The values of 






ϵ


˙




cs


−




 (at constant structure) and 






ϵ


˙




qs




 (at quasi-stationary structure) are relatively similar for large load reductions, even though the microstructures, in particular the dislocation structures, should differ significantly. This becomes understandable, if promotion of recovery by internal forward stresses is taken into account.
Combining the rates of recovery–strain in the qs state and after perturbation of monotonic flow seems promising to better understand the mechanism of dynamic recovery of crystal defects, limiting the deformation strength under monotonic as well as cyclic loading conditions.

This has only marginal influence on the results.

 followed by stepwise unloading within less than 30 


s


. It is seen how the (inelastic) strain 




ϵ


inel




 continues to increase till 307 


s


 and then starts to decrease. This decrease is called anelastic, because it is reversible on a macroscopic level. The elimination of the elastic strain helps to visualize the anelastic response that is less pronounced than the elastic one (also in comparison to the elastic response of the specimen). Equation (
A7
) may cause an elastic overcorrection at stresses below 100 


M




Pa


. However, this is irrelevant for the inelastic strain rates in the periods of relatively constant load, where the major elastic strain component resulting from
