As important structural features of the metal materials, chemical short-range ordering clusters play a critical role in the mechanical properties of the materials. They have been discovered in dilute Al-alloy systems and are usually generated by annealing processes at high temperatures or by severe plastic deformation at room temperature. In the present work, systematic first-principle calculations were conducted to evaluate the influences of the chemical short-range ordering clusters L1

Al alloys are crucial engineering materials, which are used in a wide range of structural applications [
1
,
2
,
3
,
4
,
5
,
6
,
7
,
8
]. This is because they usually show excellent mechanical properties (such as good machinability and excellent high-temperature resistance and creep resistance) as compared to pure Al [
1
,
2
,
3
,
4
,
5
,
6
,
7
,
8
]. However, similar to other dilute alloys, the mechanical properties including both tensile strength and ductility of the dilute Al alloys are two contradictory properties, which cannot be improved simultaneously. It has been found that the chemical short-range ordering structures play an important role in mechanical properties including both tensile strength and ductility. The experimental results showed that the complex concentrated alloys possess exceptional mechanical properties including both tensile strength and ductility. This may be attributed to the emergence of chemical short-range ordering (SRO) structures, which have a strong interaction with dislocation [
9
,
10
,
11
,
12
,
13
,
14
,

,

,

,

,

,

27
]. For instance, in the Cr-Co-Ni medium-entropy alloy, the effects of the chemical SRO structures on the tensile strength and ductility were investigated by Ruopeng Zhang et al. Bulk tensile tests indicated that the chemical SRO structures had a strengthening effect (an approximately 25% increase of the yield strength as well as a marked change of the work hardening behavior) on the Cr-Co-Ni medium-entropy alloy, which was due to that the formation of SRO has a strong impact on dislocation [
10
].
In addition, in dilute alloys such as Al alloys and Cu alloys, the chemical short-range ordering structures (L1
2
-Al
3
Zr, L1
0
-AlZn, FCC-Fe and B2-Fe) were also observed by using HAADF-STEM experimental technology [
11
,
13
,
14
,
15
,
20
,
24
,
25
,
26
,
27
]. For instance, in the Al-Zn alloys, the authors reported chemical short-range ordering structure L1
0
-AlZn in an ultrafine-grained supersaturated Al-Zn alloy introduced by severe plastic deformation (strain (%) > 1) at room temperature [
11
]. It is believed that vacancies introduced by severe plastic deformation play an important role in the formation of the chemical short-range ordering at room temperature. The chemical SRO was also found in Guinier-Preston (GP) zones in Al-Cu alloys, which promotes dispersion strengthening [
20
,
21
]. Moreover, in the Al-Mg-Si alloys, co-clusters ≥20 solute atoms were observed by using atom probe tomography technology and DFT calculations [
16
]. It is indicated that the stability of the single-species Si clusters is improved as the vacancies exist. In turn, the single-species Si-vacancy clusters can attract further solute atoms to serve as a pathway to the formation of the larger Mg-Si co-cluster. The larger Mg-Si co-cluster can more effectively improve the mechanical properties of the AA6016 Al-Mg-Si alloy. The tensile mechanical properties of the 6016 alloy of the PA + PB exhibited excellent ultimate tensile strength (UTS) (291 MPa) and good ductility with a uniform elongation of 18% and a total elongation of 23% [
16
]. For the Cu-Fe alloys, it has been demonstrated that the chemical short-range ordering structures (FCC-Fe and B
2
-Fe) were obtained by annealing processes at high temperatures [
13
]. The chemical short-range ordering cluster structures L1
2
-Al
3
Zr has been found in Al-Zn-Mg-Cu-Zr, and can promotes dispersion strengthening [
20
]. In these dilute alloys and complex concentrated alloys, the formation of the chemical short-range ordering structures leads to the improvement of the mechanical properties including tensile strength and ductility.
Therefore, in order to trade off the tensile strength and ductility in Al-alloy systems, it is necessary to develop new Al alloys with chemical short-range ordering cluster structures. Traditionally, the investigation of a new generation of Al alloys with excellent mechanical properties adopts the ‘trial and error’ approach, which requires a systematical production of alloys with varied compositions and aging conditions. Therefore, the theory method such as the first-principle calculations based on density function theory (DFT) was used because the “trial and error” approach is usually costly and time-consuming. To the best of our knowledge, the mechanical properties including tensile strength and ductility for the Al alloys with the chemical short-range ordering structures have rarely been investigated by using theory methods such as the first-principle calculations based on density function theory (DFT).
In the present work, the mechanical properties of the Al alloys with the chemical short-range ordering structures L1

-Al
3
Zr were studied using the first-principle calculations based on density function theory (DFT). Firstly, for comparative purposes, the supercells of the solid solution with varied compositions of the solute atoms Zr were constructed by using the special quasirandom structures (SQSs). Next, the Al supercells with the chemical short-range ordering cluster structures L1

Zr. In addition, the projected density of state (PDOS), electron localization function (ELF) and deformation charge density were computed to reveal the nature of the strengthening effects of the chemical short-range ordering structures L1

. The main findings of this work were twofold: (1) compared with the pure Al, the solid solutions with varied compositions of the solute atoms Zr and the chemical short-range ordering cluster structures L1
2
-Al
3
Zr had a strengthening effect on the pure Al supercell, which is attributed to more significant charge accumulations and electronic interactions between the host Al atoms and the Zr atoms and (2) addition of the L1

 and the ratio (

 to the work of dislocation emission

. The paper is organized as follows: in 
Section 2
, we describe, in detail, and using the computational approach, the supercells of the solid solution with varied compositions of the solute atoms Zr and Al supercell with the chemical short-range ordering cluster structure L1

Zr and in 
Section 3
, the results and discussion about the ideal tensile strength, the elastic property, the work of the dislocation emission 
G
disl
, the deformation charge density, the electron localization function (ELF) and the density of state (DOS) are presented. All main findings are summarized in 
Section 4
.
In the present work, the first-principle calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) [
28
,
29
] were conducted by using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) [
28
,
29
]. The interactions between ions and electronics were described by using the projector augmented wave potential (PAW) [
30
] method. The exchange-correlation functions were treated by utilizing the Perdew, Burke and Ernzerhof (PBE) form of generalized gradient approximation (GGA) [
31
]. In all calculations, a plane wave cutoff energy of 450 eV was adopted to guarantee converged total energies. The convergence criteria of 10
−6
 eV/atom for the total energy and 0.01 eV/Å for the atomic force were adopted. The 
k
-space integrations were conducted adopting the Monkhorst–Pack sampling scheme with an equivalent of the 
k
-point mesh of 26 × 26 × 26 for the bulk Al [
32
]. The equilibrium crystal structure data of bulk Al were calculated to be a
Al
 = 4.040 Å, which is consistent with the result of previous studies [
8
]. 
The chemical short-range ordering cluster structures (L1
2
-Al
3
Zr) are shown in 
Figure 1
. The supercells of the Al solid solution with varied compositions (3.12%Zr, 6.25%Zr, 9.37%Zr, 12.50%Zr and 15.62%Zr) of the solute atoms Zr were constructed to assess the mechanical properties of the Al solid solution, as shown in 
Figure 2
 and 
Figure 3
. 
Figure 2
 shows the supercells before relaxing atomic positions and volumes, while 
Figure 3
 denotes the supercells after relaxing atomic positions and volumes. The special quasirandom structures (SQSs) were adopted to qualitatively consider the solubility of individual solute atoms in the Al lattices [
33
,
34
,
35
]. Special quasirandom structures (SQSs) have been successfully used in many alloy systems, and they can serve as structural templates to derive the mixing energies within the context of DFT total energy computations [
33
,
34
,
35
]. In the present work, 32-atom SQSs were generated, which could successfully satisfy correlation functions of pair clusters up to 3rd-nearest neighbors and perfect triplet matches on SQSs. The atomic positions and the volumes of the supercells of the solid solution were relaxed. A 
k
-point mesh of 7 × 7 × 7 was adopted during the optimization of the supercells of the solid solution. In addition, when the first-principles tensile test of the supercells of the solid solution was conducted, a 
k
-point mesh of 7 × 7 × 7 was sufficiently employed to guarantee converged total energies to balance the accuracy and efficiency of calculation. The Al supercells with the chemical short-range ordering (SRO) cluster structures L1
2
-Al
3
Zr were obtained by substituting the Al atoms with the Zr atoms, as shown in 
Figure 2
 and 
Figure 3
. The Al supercell with the chemical short-range ordering (SRO) cluster structures L1
2
-Al
3
Zr possesses 108 atoms. Therefore, to balance the accuracy and efficiency of calculation, 5 × 5 × 5 Monkhorst–Pack 
k
-point meshes were employed to perform optimization and first-principles tensile tests of the Al supercells with the chemical short-range ordering (SRO) cluster structures L1
2
-Al
3
Zr. Firstly, the atomic positions and volumes were relaxed to obtain the most stable structures, as shown in 
Figure 3
. It can be seen that after relaxing the atoms and volumes of the supercells of the Al solid solution with varied compositions of the solute atoms Zr, the volumes were greatly changed, as shown in 
Figure 3
a–e. This is due to the fact that the size mismatch between the solute atoms Zr and host Al atoms is high (28.00%), as shown in 
Table 1
. This results in the tendency for the formation of the Al solid solution to be weak. In contrast, the volumes of the Al supercells with the chemical short-range ordering (SRO) cluster structures hardly changed after relaxing the atoms and volumes, as shown in 
Figure 3
f–h. Because the electronegativity difference between the solute atoms Zr and host Al atoms is big (17.39%), as shown in 
Table 1
. This leads to the formation of chemical short-range ordering (SRO) cluster structures L1
2
-Al

Zr being energetically favorable.
To investigate the elastic property below a specific stress, the bulk modulus 
B
, shear modulus 
G
, Young’s modulus

, Poisson’s ratio

 and hardness 
H
 of the polycrystal were calculated. The pure Al supercell and the Al supercell with the chemical short-range ordering cluster Al

Zr of volume fraction of 1/27 possess a cubic characteristic after optimizing the structure. However, the crystal structures of the Al supercell with the chemical short-range ordering cluster Al
3
Zr of volume fraction of 3/27 and 9/27 change from the cubic structure before optimizing to a tetragonal structure after optimizing. For the cubic structure material, the equations of the bulk modulus

In addition, to reveal the mechanical behavior of the pure Al supercell and the Al supercell with the chemical short-range ordering cluster Al
3
Zr, the Pugh ratio 
B
/
G
 is adopted to characterize the ductile or brittle of these materials. The bulk modulus 
B
 is considered to be resistant to fracture, while the shear modulus 
G
 is considered to be resistant to plastic deformation. If the Pugh ratio 
B
/
G
 > 1.75, the material is more ductile, otherwise, it shows a brittle characteristic [
42
]. 
The bulk modulus 
B
, shear modulus 
G
, Young’s modulus 
E
, Poisson’s ratio 
ν
 and hardness 
H
 of the pure Al supercell and the Al supercell with the chemical short-range ordering cluster Al
3
Zr of volume fraction of 1/27, 3/27 and 9/27 are displayed in 
Table 2
. When the chemical short-range ordering cluster Al
3
Zr is introduced to the Al supercell, it is seen that the increase of the volume fraction of the chemical short-range ordering cluster Al
3
Zr leads to an increase in the bulk modulus 
B
, shear modulus 
G
 and Young’s modulus 
E
. The Poisson’s ratio 
ν
 first increases when the volume fraction of the chemical short-range ordering cluster Al
3
Zr increases from 1/27 to 3/27. Then it decreases with the increase of the volume fraction of the chemical short-range ordering cluster Al
3
Zr. The smaller values (<0.5) of the Poisson’s ratio 
ν
 indicate the good compressibility of the Al supercell without or with the chemical short-range ordering cluster Al
3
Zr. The hardness 
H
 decreases first with the volume fraction of the chemical short-range ordering cluster Al
3
Zr and then increases. In particular, the value of the Pugh ratio 
B
/
G
 increases with an increase of the volume fraction of the chemical short-range ordering cluster Al
3
Zr from 1/27 to 3/27. Then, when the volume fraction of the chemical short-range ordering cluster Al
3
Zr increases from 3/27 to 9/27, the value of the Pugh ratio 
B
/
G
 is decreased from 2.572 to 2.109. Furthermore, it is seen that the value of the Pugh ratio 
B
/
G
 > 1.75, implying that the Al supercell without or with the chemical short-range ordering cluster Al
3
Zr is ductile. The ductility of the Al supercell with the chemical short-range ordering cluster Al
3
Zr of the volume fraction of 3/27 is the largest, which is consistent with the result of the first-principles tensile test. The calculated anisotropy of the bulk modulus 
B
, shear modulus 
G
, Young’s modulus 
E
 and Poisson’s ratio 
ν
 are displayed in 
Table 3
 and 
Figure 4
. From 
Table 3
 and 
Figure 4
, it is seen that the chemical short-range ordering cluster Al
3
Zr altered the anisotropy of the Al supercell. The larger the volume fraction of the chemical short-range ordering cluster Al
3
Zr the more significant the calculated anisotropy. 
In this study, the first-principles tensile test loaded in the [001] direction was conducted for the supercells of the Al solid solution with varied compositions (3.12%Zr, 6.25%Zr, 9.37%Zr, 12.50%Zr and 15.62%Zr) of the solute atoms Zr and Al supercells with the chemical short-range ordering clusters L12-Al3Zr (the volume fraction of 1/27, 3/27 and 9/27). It is well known that the theoretical tensile strengths are much larger along [001] directions as compared to the [110] and [111] directions. As a result, in this work, the [001] direction was set as the tensile direction for the solid solution supercell and the Al supercell without or with the chemical short-range ordering clusters L1
2
-Al
3
Zr. In the absence of strain, the atomic positions and the volumes were relaxed. It should be noted that the lattice parameters of pure Al supercells in the zero-strain state coincide with the previous calculation [
8
]. Under distortion, a uniaxial tensile strain was applied along the [001] direction, and at each application, the lattice vector c along the [001] direction was fixed. In contrast, the other two lattice vectors (a ([100] direction) and b ([010] direction)) perpendicular to the [001] direction were relaxed. From this quasistatic procedure, the engineering stress σ versus engineering strain ε data were obtained. The engineering stress σ can be expressed as the first order derivative of total energy

If Griffith cleavage decohesion occurs before conditions for crack tip blunting by dislocation nucleation, the deformation of the Al supercell is in the form of brittle. Conversely, if crack tip blunting by dislocation nucleation occurs before conditions for Griffith cleavage decohesion, the deformation of the Al supercell is in the form of ductile [

θ
 between the slip plane and the crack plane is 54.73° [

Figure 5
a,b, the increase of the engineering strain resulted in an increase in the engineering stress, yielding the ideal tensile strength (the maximum of the tensile stress), which is listed in 
Table 4
. It can be seen from 
Figure 5
 and

Zr of the volume fraction of 3/27 not only results in an increase in the strength of the Al supercell but also brings an increase in the ductility of the Al supercell. The result is consistent with the calculated elastic property.

Zr of volume fraction of 3/27 was much larger than that of 1/27. This result is consistent with the calculated engineering stress and strain curve, as shown in 
Figure 5

To further understand the nature of the stress enhancement (or weakening), the three-dimensional deformation charge density was obtained from Equation (16). 
Figure 7
a–f show the three-dimensional deformation charge density of pure Al and Al solid solution with varied compositions of the solute atoms Zr after relaxing atoms and volumes. The three-dimensional deformation charge density of pure Al and Al supercell with the chemical short-range ordering clusters L1

Zr after relaxing atoms and volumes are shown in 
Figure 7
g–j. It can be seen that the charge redistribution was significant in these supercells. An accumulation of the charge is represented by a yellow color, while depletion of the charge is shown by a cyan color. An accumulation of the charge indicates bond strengthening, while depletion of the charge means bond weakening. In 
Figure 7
a–f, the charge accumulations were significant between Al atoms. In particular, the charge accumulations between Al atoms and the solute atoms Zr for the Al solid solution of 3.12% Zr and 9.37% Zr were more significant than that between Al atoms for the pure Al. This explains why the ideal tensile strength of Al solid solution of 3.12% Zr and 9.37% Zr was bigger than that of the pure Al (See 
Figure 5
a). The charge accumulations between Al atoms and the solute atoms Zr for the Al supercells with the chemical short-range ordering clusters L1

Zr were stronger than that between Al atoms for the pure Al supercells, which leads to larger ideal tensile strength for the Al supercell with chemical short-range ordering clusters L1

Zr on the pure Al supercell. The ELF can clearly characterize the formation of bonds and electron occupation of the atomic orbitals. The type of bonding is indicated by the distribution and overall intensity of the ELF. For instance, the regions of space between the atomic cores are occupied homogeneously by the free electrons of the metal. In addition, in metals, the relative intensities of the ELF remain low. However, in ionic and covalent materials, the electronic distribution in the region between neighboring atoms is more localized. Moreover, ionic and covalent materials show a larger overall intensity of the ELF. It can be seen from 
Figure 8
a,c) that the pure Al displays a low overall ELF intensity (~0.5 e/Bohr
3
), indicating that there is a metallic bonding characterization in the pure Al. When the solute atom Zr and chemical short-range ordering clusters L1
2
-Al
3
Zr are introduced to the pure Al supercell, the regions around the Zr show a lower overall ELF intensity (~0.0 e/Bohr
3
), suggesting that the delocalization of the electronics is more significant in the region around the Zr. However, the regions around the Al show a larger overall ELF intensity (~0.7 e/Bohr
3
), indicating that the localization of the electronics is more significant in the region around the Al. This means that the metallic bonding between Al atoms for the pure Al will shift towards partially covalent or ionic bonding between the Al atom and Zr atom for the Al solid solution supercell and the Al supercells with the chemical short-range ordering clusters L1

Zr, which increases the bonding interaction between the Al and the nearest neighbor Zr atoms. These results are consistent with the charge density differences (See 
Figure 7
) and the calculated engineering stress–strain curves (See 
Figure 5
).
Apart from the charge density difference and electron localization function (ELF), the electronic interactions of solute atoms Zr and surrounding host Al atoms in the Al supercells with the chemical short-range ordering cluster L1

Figure 9
b, there are no significant hybrid peaks of the p electronic state of the host Al atoms and the d electronic state of the solute atoms Zr. In addition, it can be seen from 
Figure 9
c that the hybrid peaks of the p electronic state of the host Al atoms and the d electronic state of the solute atoms Zr are significant, as indicated by the arrows. 
Figure 9
d shows that the p electronic state of the host Al atoms and the d electronic state of the solute atoms Zr only exist as a hybrid peak below the Fermi level, as denoted in the arrow. These results indicate that the interactions between the solute atoms Zr and nearest the host Al atoms in the Al supercells with the chemical short-range ordering clusters L1
