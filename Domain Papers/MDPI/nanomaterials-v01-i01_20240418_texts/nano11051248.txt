In the past decades, the energy consumption of nonrenewable fossil fuels has been increasing, which severely threatens human life. Thus, it is very urgent to develop renewable and reliable energy storage devices with features of environmental harmlessness and low cost. High power density, excellent cycle stability, and a fast charge/discharge process make supercapacitors a promising energy device. However, the energy density of supercapacitors is still less than that of ordinary batteries. As is known to all, the electrochemical performance of supercapacitors is largely dependent on electrode materials. In this review, we firstly introduced six typical transition metal oxides (TMOs) for supercapacitor electrodes, including RuO

, Co

, MnO
2
, ZnO, XCo

O

 (X = Mn, Cu, Ni), and AMoO

 (A = Co, Mn, Ni, Zn). Secondly, the problems of these TMOs in practical application are presented and the corresponding feasible solutions are clarified. Then, we summarize the latest developments of the six TMOs for supercapacitor electrodes. Finally, we discuss the developing trend of supercapacitors and give some recommendations for the future of supercapacitors.
Owing to the rapid development of the global economy, accelerating the consumption of fossil fuels like coal, fuel, and natural gas, the problems of global climate change and environmental pollution are increasing to significant levels. Developing solar, wind, tidal, and other renewable clean energy is a way to mitigate current energy and environmental pollution problems [

,
2
,
3
,
4
,
5
,
6
]. However, those renewable clean forms of energy are severely restricted by environmental factors and energy supply is intermittent [
7
]. Therefore, it is urgent to develop effective and reliable devices for energy storage [
8
,
9
]. As a new type of storage device, supercapacitors have gained great attention in recent years thanks to their advantages of fast charge/discharge rate, high power density, and very long cycle life [
10
,
11
,
12
,
13
,
14
]. Supercapacitors have great potential in the area of portable electronic equipment, renewable energy systems, and hybrid power cars [
15
,
16
,
17
]. There are two categories of supercapacitors: electrical double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) and pseudocapacitors [
18
,
19
]. For EDLCs, energy is stored with the charge accumulating on the interface between the electrode and electrolyte. For pseudocapacitors, the energy is stored through a fast and reversible faradaic redox reaction [
20
,
21
,
22
]. At present, the low energy density is still the bottleneck of supercapacitors [
23
,
24
]. According to the energy density formula,

, where 
E
 represents the energy density, 
C
 represents the specific capacitance, and 
V
 represents the potential window, we can know that the energy density of a supercapacitor depends on both capacitance and operating voltage, and it can be enhanced by increasing the potential window and using an electrode material with high capacitance [
25
,
26
]. It is noteworthy that the design and preparation of electrode materials are the key steps to determine the electrochemical performance of supercapacitors. In other words, the performance of supercapacitors is highly dependent on electrode materials [
27
,
28
,
29
,
30
].
Electrode materials can be divided into three categories: carbon materials, conductive polymers, and transition metal oxides (TMOs). Carbon materials are usually used as electrode materials for EDLCs. They have the characteristics of high specific surface area, adjustable pore size distribution, and excellent electrical conductivity [
31
,
32
]. Owing to the storage mechanism of EDLCs, carbon materials can provide high power density, but low energy density, which limits the overall performance [
33
,
34
]. Carbon materials such as graphene, carbon nanotubes, and carbon nanofibers have been widely studied for electrode materials. However, low specific capacitance of carbon material limits the capacity of the EDLCs [
35
], and the applications of those carbon materials are limited by their high cost [
36
]. The conductive and pseudocapacitive properties of conductive polymers are good, but the stability is poor, and conductive polymers can easily fall off the substrate [
37
,
38
]. For example, the charge and discharge speed of polyaniline is low and the stability of the charge/discharge process is poor [
39
,
40
]. TMOs have higher specific capacitance (100–2000 F g
−1
), higher energy density than carbon materials, and better chemical stability than conductive polymers [
41
,
42
,
43
]. Thanks to its high theoretical capacitance and rapid faraday redox reaction, RuO
2
 is thought to be an optimal pseudocapacitive electrode material [
44
,
45
,
46
]. However, its high price and toxicity to the environment seriously hinder its application in supercapacitors [
47
,
48
,
49
]. Co
3
O
4
, MnO
2
, and ZnO have the advantages of being natural abundant and high specific capacitance, which makes them substitutes for RuO
2
 [
50
,
51
]. The disadvantage of poor electrical conductivity is exhibited by many metal oxide electrodes [
52
]. Because of the co-existence of two metal ions and synergistic effects of elements, ternary metal oxides, AB
2
O
4
 (A or B = Ni, Co, Mo, Mn, and so on), have more active reaction sites and high electrical conductivity than binary metal oxides [
53
]. In addition, spinel cobaltates (XCo
2
O
4
, X = Ni, Cu, Zn, Mn, and so on) and metal molybdate (AMoO
4
, A = Ni, Mn, Co, and so on) have received tremendous research interest because of their low cost, enhanced electrochemical activity, and being a natural abundant resource [
54
,
55
].
In this review, six transition metal oxide materials including RuO

, Co

, MnO
2
, ZnO, XCo
2
O
4
 (X = Mn, Cu, Ni), and AMoO

 (A = Co, Mn, Ni, Zn) are firstly introduced. Secondly, existing problems of those TMOs in practical application and the corresponding methods are presented. The methods include synthesizing composites, preparing material in nano scale, introducing battery-type material or oxygen vacancies, and modification of quantum dots. Particularly, we introduce the latest developments of six TMOs for supercapacitor electrode according to the strategies. Finally, the future development of supercapacitors is discussed and recommendations on supercapacitors are exhibited.
RuO
2
 has high theoretical capacitance (2000 F g
−1
) and it can carry out rapid faraday redox reaction. It has good electrical conductivity, high chemical and thermal stability, as well as a big voltage window. Thus, RuO
2
 is called the most ideal pseudocapacitive electrode material [
40
,
56
]. However, ruthenium is too expensive to be used for large-scale synthesis of electrode materials.
Synthesizing composites can improve the utilization of RuO
2
 and reduce the cost of RuO
2
 electrode [
57
]. At the same time, the synergistic effect of the materials is beneficial to improve the electrochemical performance of the electrode. Various forms of RuO
2
-based electrodes have been prepared such as metal sulfide-RuO
2
 electrode, metal oxide-RuO
2
 electrode, carbon material-RuO
2
 electrode, and multicomponent RuO
2
-based electrode [
39
,
57
,
58
,
59
,
60
,
61
]. Asim et al. [
62
] decorated carbon nanotubes (CNTs) grown carbon cloth (CNTS-CC) with RuO
2
 nanorods (RuO
2
-NRs) via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and the annealing process. The prepared electrode has the characteristics of both supercapacitors and lithium batteries. The results show that the designed material has high specific capacitance (176 F g
−1
) and superior cycling stability (97% retention after 10,000 cycles at 40 mA cm
−2
) (
Figure 1
).
In addition, they demonstrate a reversible capacity of ~3.85 mAh cm
−2
 at the current density of 100 mA cm
−2
 as a Li-ion batteries electrode. The excellent electrochemical performance lies in the synergistic effect of metal oxide NRs and the unique structure of CNTS-CC. Enlarged surface area and exposed active sites allow accessibility of the ions/electrolytes to the electrodes. Ternary single-walled carbon nanotubes/RuO
2
/polyindole (SWCNT/RuO
2
/PIn) nanocomposite fabricated by Zhu’s group [
63
] presents the specific capacitance of 1283 F g

 at 1.0 A g
−1
. At 500 W kg
−1
 and 5000 W kg
−1
, the energy densities of the SWCNT/RuO
2
/PIn electrode-based symmetric supercapacitor are 42 W h kg
−1
 and 33 W h kg
−1
, respectively. It also shows good cycling stability and capacitive performance of 1203 F g
−1
 at 1.0 A g
−1
. Via the hydrothermal and annealing process, CuCo
2
O
4
/CuO nanoneedles were synthesized directly on the conductive Ni foam (NF), on which RuO
2
 nanoparticles were deposited [
64
]. The CuCo

O

/CuO@RuO
2
 can work as water oxidation catalysis and has low overpotential (279 mV at 10 mA cm
−2
), low Tafel slope, and stable long-term performance. Besides, it achieves a high areal capacity up to 862.5 mAh cm
−2
 and a capacity retention of about 90.1% after 8000 cycles. The hybrid supercapacitor fabricated by CuCo

 and activated carbon achieves an energy density of 0.84 mW h cm

 at 8 mW cm
−2
.
In the reports above, many electrode materials have the addition of carbon materials. Theoretically, adding carbon materials can improve the surface area and conductivity of electrodes [
65
]. However, some reports pointed out that the porous surface of carbon materials was blocked by RuO
2
 particles, which results in reduced surface area, limited electrochemical properties, and decreased double layer capacitance [
66
,
67
]. Hydrated RuO
2
 is a kind of nanocrystalline material with RuO
2
 as the core and a small amount of water hydrogen bond on the surface. The form of porous structure provides conduction paths for protons to enter the inner part of RuO
2
 [
68
,
69
]. The annealing treatment of activated carbon-RuO
x
•nH
2
O composites (annealing for 2 h in 200 °C air) obviously improves the discontinuity of the electron path in particles. Further, the obstacle of electron hopping between particles is reduced because a large amount of active carbon (AC) powder is introduced. The specific capacitance of the RuO
x
•nH
2
O is 1340 F g
−1
 (at 25 mV s
−1
) [
70
]. Similarly, Yang’s group [
71
] synthesized RuO
2
@SWCNTs/graphene (S/G) composites by the sol–gel method. The hybrid electrode material, RuO
2
@S/G-60, has a specific capacitance up to 988 F g
−1
 and excellent rate capability at 1 A g
−1
. Hexagon WO

 (h-WO
3
) and hydrous RuO
2
 were respectively prepared on three-dimensional conducting carbon cloth (CC) via the hydrothermal method [
72
], which meant fast electronic pathway, high conductivity substrate, high surface area, and enhanced electrochemical performance.

−3
 at 5 mA cm
−2
. Moreover, at a power density of 40 W cm
−3
, the asymmetric supercapacitor device shows brilliant energy density of 1.25 W h cm
−3
 and it also shows promising electrochemical stability. By comparison, an all-pseudocapacitive asymmetric device [
73
] has an energy density of only 37 µW h cm
−2
 at 40 mW cm
−2
, but a remarkable 96% retention after 20,000 charge/discharge cycles.

 has the advantages of high theoretical specific capacitance (3560 F g
−1
), low price, environmental friendliness, and good chemical durability, so it is a promising active material [
75
,
76
,
77
]. However, the capacitance in practical application differs a lot from the theoretical value. A reason is that electron transfer is hindered owing to low conductivity, slow kinetics, large volume expansion-contraction, and severe particle aggregation. Thus, the capacitance and cycling performance of Co
3
O
4
 are limited [
78
,
79
].
Nanomaterials have a large surface with numerous active sites. The ultra-small size of nanomaterials shortens the electron/ion diffusion path, providing favorable transfer pathways [
78
]. Because the dimension and morphology of the materials play an important role in improving the electrochemical performance, increasingly more attention has been paid to the synthetic materials in micro and nano scale [
80
]. A variety of Co
3
O
4
 nanomaterials have been synthesized, such as nanowires [
81
], nanofibers [
82
], nanoparticles [
83
,
84
], and nanosheets [
85
]. Yue and co-workers [
86
] used a simple and environmentally friendly one-step hydrothermal and calcination method to prepare Co

/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) composites. Tiny Co
3
O
4
 nanoparticles are dispersed on rGO flakes and a three-dimensional structure is formed. The prepared electrode has more active sites than Co

 nanowires [
87
] to achieve better electrochemical performance. The optimized electrode Co
3
O
4
/rGO-120-12 shows high specific capacitance of 1152 F g
−1
 at 1 A g
−1
. Indira Priyadharsini [
88
] firstly prepared Co
3
O
4
 nanoparticles by the sol–gel method. The obtained Co
3
O
4
 nanoparticles, carbon, and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) were then mixed with a mass ratio of 8:1:1. The electrode was prepared by coating the synthesized slurry uniformly on the Ni foam substrate. The specific capacitance of the electrode at 11 mA cm
−2
 is 761.25 F g
−1
. The reason for the low specific capacitance is that the addition of PVDF increases the resistance between the collector and the redox active material, which results in a decrease in the number of active sites and the electron/charge transport rate [
89
]. However, directly growing Co
3
O
4
 active materials on conductive substrates such as carbon fiber, carbon cloth, stainless steel sheet, and metal foam can avoid the addition of binder and conductive additive [
51
]. Ag doped Co
3
O

 nanosheets synthesized on Ni foam [
90
] possess a specific surface area (176 m

 g

) larger than the original Co

O

 (108 m

 g
−1
). There is still a superior specific capacitance of 1323 F g
−1
 at the current density of 10 A g
−1
 (92.84% of the initial specific capacitance), indicating outstanding rate capability of the sample. Furthermore, it exhibits 104.7% of the initial capacitance at the first 2000 cycles. The electrode materials prepared by Yang’s group [
91
] and Wang et al. [
92
] both show good electrochemical properties (883 F g
−1
 and 1606.6 F g
−1
 at the current density of 1 A g
−1
, respectively). Electrode prepared by Wei [
93
] has unique nanoarray structures. The SEM images of Co

 nanowires were anchored on the surface of the Co

 nanosheet, effectively expanding the surface area, providing rich active states for the faradaic redox reaction and promoting the diffusion rate of electrolyte ions. The sample prepared at hydrothermal heating for 8 h (Co
3
O
4
/NF-8 h) shows a high specific capacitance of 2053.1 F g
−1
 at 1 A g
−1
. The working voltage of the hybrid supercapacitor device assembled by the hetero-structured Co
3
O
4
 array and graphene can reach 1.6 V. The maximum energy density of 22.2 W h kg
−1
 is delivered and the excellent cycle is proved by the 93.3% capacitance retention after 10,000 cycles.
In recent years, metal organic frameworks (MOFs)-based materials have attracted attention in various fields of gas adsorption, energy device, pollutant degradation, electrocatalysis, and drug release [
1
]. Besides, with adjustable porous structure, controllable pore size distribution, and high surface area, MOFs are thought to be an ideal template for the preparation of Co
3
O
4
 nanomaterials [
94
,
95
]. Commonly, Zeolitic Imidazolate Frameworks-67 (ZIF-67) is used as precursor to synthesize Co
3
O
4
 nanomaterials. With ZIF-67 crystals as precursor, porous Co
3
O
4
 nanoparticles [
96
] were transformed by simple calcination treatment. The results show that ZIF-67-derived Co

O

 nanoparticles exhibit high specific capacitance (190 F g

 at 5 A g
−1
) and capacitance retention (71.42% after 5000 cycles). Bao and co-workers [

 is obtained at 1 A g
−1
 and the capacitance retention is 74% at 10 A g
−1
. Meanwhile, the hybrid nanocages still maintain 72.34% of original capacitance after 8000 charge/discharge cycles. In addition, α-Co/Ni(OH)

−1
. This shows 2D Co

 ultrathin nanoparticles’ great performance in oxygen evolution reaction. Besides, Co-based MOFs (Co-MOFs) have become fascinating templates for thermal transformation to generate porous Co

 structures [
99
]. Li et al. [
100
] prepared 3D porous carbon (3DPC)/Co
3
O
4
 composites by pyrolysis of 3D graphene/Co-MOF precursor. The electrochemical performance of the composites is not good (specific capacitance of 423 F g
−1
 at 1 A g
−1
 and capacitance attenuation of about 17% after 2000 cycles). This is because MOFs-based electrodes are usually composed of insulation binder, conductivity additives, and MOFs, which hinders the electrolyte penetration and reduces the electron transport between electroactive sites of active material and electrolytes [
101
].
Synthesizing electrode materials directly on conductive substrates can avoid the addition of insulation binder so as to reduce interparticle resistance [
51
]. In order to further obtain high performance electrode materials, Han et al. [

 nanoparticles on graphene nanosheets supported by carbon fabric. The electrode shows an unbelievable specific capacitance of 3480 F g
−1
, which is close to the theoretical value (3560 F g
−1
). Besides, they fabricated a flexible symmetric supercapacitor device with two pieces of prepared electrode. The flexible supercapacitor has no sacrifices of electrochemical performance when it is bent under bending angles from 0° to 150°. Furthermore, the supercapacitor delivers capacitance of 580 F g
−1
 and 13.8% capacitance decline after 20,000 cycles. The maximum energy density of the device is 80 W h kg
−1
 (
Figure 4
).
Owing to its rich natural content, no environmental pollution, and high theoretical specific capacitance (1380 F g
−1
), MnO
2
 has been widely studied as the most competitive transition metal oxide [
103
,
104
,
105
]. However, its application in supercapacitors is seriously affected because of its poor conductivity and slow ion transport rate [
106
,
107
,
108
].
Carbonaceous materials have excellent electrical conductivity and stability with large surface area [
31
,
32
]. Carbon nanotubes [
109
,
110
], graphene [
111
,
112
], carbon nanowires [
113
,
114
], carbon nanofibers [
115
], and other carbon materials can be used as scaffolds for depositing MnO
2
 nanostructures. Large surface area with a great quantity of active sites is provided and the contact path between electrode materials and electrolytes is shortened, which enhances electrochemical properties [
116
]. The hollow N-doped carbon (HNC)@MnO
2
 3D core–shell composites prepared by Cai et al. [
117
] exhibit a good electrochemical capacity of 247.9 F g
−1
 at 0.5 A g
−1
, as well as a retention capacity of 82.9% at 5 A g
−1
 after 2000 cycles. Via a simple one-step water bath at 40 °C, Long et al. [
118
] developed interconnected δ-MnO
2
 nanosheets flexible electrode on activated carbon cloth. The electrode displays brilliant charge storage performance (a neglected degradation during the 2000 times of folding). When the power density of the asymmetric supercapacitor is 1198.4 W kg
−1
, the energy density can reach 49.8 W h kg
−1
. After 5000 cycles, the capacitance retention of the asymmetric supercapacitor can reach 90.6%. Lei and co-workers [
119
] synthesized MnO
2
 nanosheets@graphenated CNTs network on 316 L stainless steel by the CVD method followed by annealing treatment (
Figure 5
).
Providing an effective electronic pathway, graphenated CNTs are interconnected to form porous structures, with MnO
2
 nanoparticles uniformly distributed on the surface. Furthermore, the unique structure of MnO
2
 nanosheets@graphenated CNTs nanocomposites shortens the ion transport distance, promotes charge transfer, and accelerates reversible redox reactions, thereby improving the capacitance performance. A high energy density of 51.2 W h kg
−1
 is obtained at 24.42 W h cm
−2
 and the maximum power density is 0.4 kW kg
−1
 (200 W cm
−2
). 3D-graphene/MnO
2
 foam composite [
120
] was prepared by a combination of the CVD and hydrothermal method. The study shows that 3D-graphene/MnO
2
 composite electrodes in the absence of carbon black have a high specific capacitance of 333.4 F g
−1
 at 0.2 A g
−1
 and excellent cycling stability.
However, the high cost and complex preparation process of commercial carbon materials are not conducive to large-scale preparation. Therefore, it is very important to develop low price and renewable materials to meet the increasing demand. Biomass resource is a renewable resource with high utilization value. Biomass resource utilization has become a hot area and pillar of economic and social development in the future [
121
]. Biomass-derived carbon has the advantages of high natural abundance, environmental friendliness, diverse structures, long cycle life, and low costs [
36
,
122
,
123
]. In addition, the multistage pore structure and the inherent stability of carbon materials give biomass carbon unique advantages and prospects in the application of electrochemical materials. Hence, biomass-derived carbon has great potential in supercapacitors. Yang’s group [
35
] used banana peel as a carbon source to synthesize MnO
2
/biomass-based porous carbon (BPC) composites by the hydrothermal method. The MnO
2
/BPC composites electrode has a great specific capacitance of 139.6 F g
−1
 at the current density of 300 mA g
−1
 and 70 F g
−1
 at 10 A g
−1
. In addition, it loses 7.7% of the specific capacitance after 1000 cycles. In Shen’s research [
124
], soybean pod was used as the precursor of carbon matrix to prepare MnO
2
/soybean pod carbon (SPC) composites by a one-step in situ hydrothermal method. The prepared material retains the original tubular structure of the pods, with a large number of δ-MnO
2
 nanorods covered on the surface. According to the research, the MnO
2
/SPC electrode has a better specific capacitance than the MnO
2
 electrode (530 F g
−
1
 and 362 F g
−
1
, respectively). Besides, the symmetric MnO
2
/SPC-based supercapacitor displays high capacitance retention of 91% after 6000 cycles and maintains the energy density of 35.1 W h kg
−

 at a high power density of 9000 W kg

1
. The hollow structure of MnO
2
/carbon spheres (CSs) [
125

 aqueous solution by sonication. Then, this aqueous solution was heated at 160 °C for 3 h in a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave. After the reaction and cooling down, the product was vacuum filtered, washed, thoroughly dried at 60 °C, and then labeled as MnO

) is obtained at a power density of 500 W kg
−1
. Moreover, the asymmetric supercapacitor shows a good cycling stability of 93.9% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles.
According to Nie’s study [
126
], introducing battery-type metal oxides into MnO
2
-based electrodes has been thought to be an effective way to increase the capacity and energy density of supercapacitors. Rapid redox reactions and synergistic effects of MnO

 and battery metal oxides improve the overall performance of the electrode. The electrode [

Electrode materials largely determine the performance of supercapacitors [
129
]. Therefore, people have been looking for electrode materials with good electrochemical performance. TMOs have gotten extensive attention because of their high redox activity, good theoretical capacitance, and low costs [
130
]. ZnO is a well-known active material that has the characteristics of environmental protection, natural abundance, and ideal capacitance [
50
,
131
,
132
]. Via the chemical coprecipitation method, Dhivya Angelin et al. [
133
] modified the ZnO nanostructure with doping Zr. The experimental results indicate that 9 wt.% Zr-doped ZnO nanostructure has the best electrochemical performance of excellent specific capacitance of 518 F g
−1
 (at 1 A g
−1
) and capacitance retention of 94% (5000 successive galvanostatic charge-discharge cycles). ZnO nanomembranes (NMs) [
134
] were prepared with 100 atomic layer deposition (ALD) cycles. 
Figure 6
a shows the fabrication procedure of ZnO NMs electrode and the corresponding supercapacitor. 
Figure 6
b–d display the SEM images of the ZnO NMs with 50, 100, and 200 ALD cycles.
In different electrolytes, the ZnO NMs have different specific capacitance, 846 F g

 (6 M KOH at 1 A g

 (1 M KCl at 1 A g

), respectively. However, those materials mentioned all have the problem of capacity attenuation during long-term cycling [
135
,
136
].
Numerous ZnO-based electrode materials are fabricated, such as carbon material-ZnO electrode [
137
,
138
,
139
], medal oxides-ZnO electrode [
140
,
141
,
142
], and polymer-ZnO electrode [
143
,
144
], for the purpose of pursuing good electrochemical performance. With asphalt as carbon source and ZnO as template, graphene nanocapsules (GNCs) [
145
] were synthesized by in situ KOH activation technology. High-speed channels for electron conduction, micropores for ion adsorption, and short pores for ion transport are provided by the 3D porous network. As supercapacitor electrodes, the GNCs exhibit great capacitance of 194 F g
−1
 at 20 A g
−1
 (277 F g
−1
 at 0.05 A g
−1
) and capacitance loss of 2.6% after 15,000 cycles. Chebrolu et al. [
146
] fabricated a series of metal oxide composite nanostructures using the chemical bath deposition method. Those metal oxide composite nanostructures include ZnO nanowires, NiO nanosheets, ZnO/CuO nanowire arrays, ZnO/FeO nanocrystals, ZnO/NiO nanosheets, and ZnO/PbO nanotubes, among which ZnO/NiO nanosheets have the best electrochemical performance (at 8 mA cm
−2
 with a specific capacitance of 1248 F g
−1
 and long-term cycling stability). Because of ZnO/NiO nanosheets’ unique surface morphology, increasing the electron transfer rate and electrical conductivity, the energy storage properties are improved. Di’s group [
147
] reported that combing ZnO with a small amount of Al
2
O

 could prevent the ZnO nano-framework from collapsing. Meanwhile, the specific surface area of the material could be increased to enlarge the contact area between the composite and the electrolyte solution. The Al

-CuO-ZnO@GO nanocomposite films by the hydrothermal method and then examined the effect of carbon ion irradiation on the properties of the prepared nanocomposite. The results of X-ray diffraction (XRD) suggest that low doses of carbon ion irradiation enhance the crystallinity of the materials, and high doses irradiation lead to deficiencies and disorder to the Co

-CuO-ZnO@GO, resulting in distortion and defects in the structure of the material. According to the study of electrochemical performance, the highest specific capacitance (1950 F g

) is obtained at a radiation dose of 5.0 × 10

, respectively. Self-assembled ZnO-CoO@nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) electrode [
152
] was prepared by the hydrothermal method combined with annealing. Owing to high conductivity, rich oxygen vacancies, and mesoporous structure, the electrode based on ZnO-CoO@NC shows a good cycle stability of 92% specific capacitance retention at 2 A g
−1
 (40,000 cycles) without morphology change. Besides, the graphene//ZnO-CoO@NC device also has 94% capacitance retention after 10,000 cycles at 2 A g

. At a potential window of 1.6 V, the device possesses an energy density of 16.5 W h kg

A study [
153
] pointed out that the surface morphology of the powder coating became smoother and the exposed surface area lessened after a series of electrochemical reactions, because of which specific capacitance decreased. To solve this problem, ZnO rods are prepared by a hydrothermal method and then coated with a MoO
4
2−
 modified carbon layer (Mo-C) [
154
]. The carbon coating is composed of many tiny carbon spheres of 10–50 nm in size. Owing to the mesoporous structure, ZnO@Mo-C possesses a larger specific surface area (96.36 m

) than pure zinc oxide (0.835 m
2
 g
−1
). In addition, compared with the electrode material prepared by Mohamed’s group [
155
], ZnO@Mo-C displays better capacitance and rate capability (900 F g

 and 650 F g

 and, at 16,985.55 W kg

, ZnO@CoS shows a high specific capacity of 898.9 C g

 with an areal capacity of 2438 mC cm

. In addition, the capacity retention of 107% after 10,000 cycles shows its remarkable cycling stability.

The electrochemical performance of the MCo

-based electrodes above is not ideal and does not meet the requirements of high-performance supercapacitors. Because of the lack of active sites, serious agglomeration, and destruction of electrode materials during the long cycle, the electrochemical performance of the electrodes is weakened [
55
]. The core–shell structure has a large number of electroactive sites and fast ion diffusion. Moreover, ions and electrons are accessible to the interior of the electroactive materials. So, the composites in the core–shell structure can possess a good cycle life and rate retention. At the same time, compared with a single component, the heterostructure composites with two constituents deliver better electrochemical performances owing to the synergistic effect [
127
,
148
]. Therefore, researchers speculate that the proper design of the core–shell structure can improve the cycle stability and prevent the collapse during the cycle [

Transition metal sulfides have the characteristics of high faradic redox activities, unique physical or chemical properties, and long cycle performance. The conductivity of metal sulfides is higher than that of corresponding oxides, which is more convenient for electron transfer. In addition, low electroconductivity restricts TMOs further application in supercapacitors. At the same time, transition metal sulfides can make up for the shortcoming of TMOs. Moreover, because of the synergistic effect between the two individual materials, the mixed structure electrode can also improve the whole active region and promote the transport of ions from the electrolyte [

There are three reasons that can explain why the introduction of oxygen vacancies is an effective strategy to improve the electrochemical performance. (i) Introduction of oxygen vacancies can adjust the surface chemical structure and enlarge the electroactive sur-face area exposed to the electrolyte. (ii) Oxygen vacancies can help the diffusion for charge carriers. Therefore, the conductivity of TMOs is improved. (iii) Electrochemical active sites are created when oxygen vacancies are introduced because the oxygen vacancies can serve as active sites for redox reactions. The kinetics of surface reactions is accelerated and the capacitance is increased [

The results indicate that an appropriate oxygen vacancy content can increase the diffusion rate of carriers. In addition, oxygen vacancies as active sites for redox reactions can accelerate the surface kinetics reaction. The NiCo

Compared with carbon materials, pseudocapacitive materials like metal oxides and organic conductive materials have higher specific capacitance owing to redox reaction on the surface of the material. In addition, ternary metal oxides have more active sites and faster redox reactions than single metal oxides, which become one of the materials to replace RuO
2
 [
53
,
172
,
173
,
174
]. As the hotspots of mixed transition metal oxides, the transition metal molybdates have attracted much attention because of their advantages including natural abundance, high theoretical specific capacitance, and low costs [
175
]. The performance of supercapacitors depends largely on the morphology and structure of their electrode materials. Therefore, it is very important to design electrode materials with unique spatial structure characteristics [
176
].
According to Yi’s study [
127
], the design of heterostructure composites has proved to be a hopeful way to promote the electrochemical properties of TMOs. Core–shell structure is a kind of heterostructure. The core–shell structure can supply large specific surface area with rich porosity. Meanwhile, the electron transfer rate is accelerated by core materials and electrochemical redox active sites are provided by shell materials. The volume changes during the cycle process are adjusted by the structure. In addition, the synergistic effect of each component is utilized to improve the electrochemical performance of the electrode [

Quantum dots (QDs) are zero-dimensional nanoparticles of metal or semiconductor crystals with a diameter between 2 and 8 nanometers [
183
]. Quantum dots have attracted much attention for various applications owing to their characteristics such as quantum tunneling effect, surface effect, and quantum confinement effect [
184
]. It is noteworthy that the size of the material largely decides the substantial variation of fundamental electrical and optical properties [
185
]. Therefore, optical, electronic, and mechanical properties of QDs are different from corresponding nanoparticles [
186
]. For example, infinite exciton Bohr radius converts graphene to graphene quantum dots (GQDs) and GQDs start to fluoresce because electron distribution is transparently modified by the crystal boundary with the dimension of the crystal reducing to a nanometer scale [
185
]. Moreover, some unique properties of zero-dimensional nanoparticles like distinct edge and quantum confinement effects help to improve the electrochemical performance [
183
]. Some studies prove that quantum dot modification is an effective method for improving electrochemical performance [
187
,
188
,
189
]. Hence, it can be speculated that quantum dot modification is a promising strategy to improve the performance of AMoO

-based electrode. To the best of our knowledge, there are still relatively few reports in this regard. Zhu et al. [
190

−1
, respectively. It also has 1.25% capacitance loss over 10,000 cycles at 5 A g

 is four times higher than that of pure MnCo

], mesoporous NiMoO
4
 microspheres were modified by silver quantum dots to fabricate the Ag QDs/NiMoO

Owing to high specific surface area, plenty of active sites, enhanced interfacial conductivity, and porous structure, the Ag QDs/NiMoO

The main purpose of developing supercapacitors is to meet the requirement of storing renewable energy. Supercapacitors have the advantages of high-power density, excellent cycle stability, and fast charge/discharge process. The performance of supercapacitors largely depends on the electrode materials. TMOs are the most favored because of their higher energy density and specific capacity than carbon materials, and better chemical stability than conductive polymers.
In this review, we have summarized recent developments of TMOs-based electrode materials for supercapacitors, including design, fabrication, and electrochemical performances. RuO
2
 is the ideal TMOs electrode material, but high cost and toxicity are its fatal shortcomings. Co
3
O
4
, MnO
2
, and ZnO are supposed to substitute RuO
2
. However, existing problems like low conductivity hinder their practical application in electrode materials. Therefore, we have introduced some strategies to solve the problems. (i) Preparing nano scale materials. The small size enlarges the contact surface and shortens the ion diffusion distance between materials and electrolyte. The size of material largely decides the substantial variation of fundamental electrical and optical properties. In addition, optical, electronic, and mechanical properties of QDs are different from corresponding nanoparticles. That is why QDs are very attractive in various fields. (ii) Utilizing the synergistic effect. It is very important that, through different combinations of carbon materials, transition metal oxides, transition metal sulfides, and other materials, the synergistic effect between different components can be used to improve the electrochemical performance effectively. In addition, some electrode materials containing metal sulfides exhibit good electrochemical performance, which indicates that other binary metal materials such as metal phosphides and metal nitrides also have potential for electrode materials. (iii) Synthesizing composites with a special structure. Porous structure, core–shell structure, and hollow structure can enlarge the surface area with generous electrochemical active sites and reduce the resistance of ion and electron transfer, thus increasing the conductivity and the rate of redox reaction. Further, the introduction of oxygen vacancies can not only increase active sites, but also adjust the surface chemical structure, improving the conductivity. (iv) Ternary transition oxides have higher conductivity, faster faradic reaction, and more active sites than single metal oxides. At the same time, 
Table 1
, 
Table 2
 and 
Table 3
 show that ternary transition oxides have better performance than single transition oxides in the practical application of both electrode and supercapacitor. We believe that ternary TMOs will be the focus of future research on transition metal oxides.
Although much promising progress has been obtained in TMOs-based electrode materials, low energy density is still an obstacle for the development of supercapacitors. We have three recommendations on the development of supercapacitors. (i) Researchers should aim efforts towards how to obtain raw material of electrode with low cost and no pollution, and the use of biomass carbon materials is a good example. (ii) The development of portable and wearable electronic devices drives the study of flexible supercapacitors. That means, apart from increasing the energy density, it is necessary to achieve the stability of the capacitance performance under different bending and deformation conditions. (iii) At present, there are many reports on transparent and flexible electrodes for solar batteries. Moreover, supercapacitors based on battery-type electrodes are also widely reported. At the same time, hybrid supercapacitors can shorten the gap between conventional metal ion batteries and supercapacitors [
