ABSTRACT = {Microencapsulated paraffin wax/polyaniline was prepared using a simple in situ polymerization technique, and its performance characteristics were investigated. Weight losses of samples were determined by Thermal Gravimetry Analysis (TGA). The microencapsulated samples with 23% and 49% paraffin showed less decomposition after 330 °C than with higher percentage of paraffin. These samples were then subjected to a thermal cycling test. Thermal properties of microencapsulated paraffin wax were evaluated by Differential Scanning Calorimeter (DSC). Structure stability and compatibility of core and coating materials were also tested by Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer (FTIR), and the surface morphology of the samples are shown by Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM). It has been found that the microencapsulated paraffin waxes show little change in the latent heat of fusion and melting temperature after one thousand thermal recycles. Besides, the chemical characteristics and structural profile remained constant after one thousand thermal cycling tests. Therefore, microencapsulated paraffin wax/polyaniline is a stable material that can be used for thermal energy storage systems.},

ABSTRACT = {Doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX) is an effective anticancer agent for leukemia chemotherapy, although its clinical use has been limited because of its side effects such as cardiotoxicity, alopecia, vomiting, and leucopenia. Attention has been focussed on developing new drug carriers with high adsorption capacity and rapid adsorption rate in order to minimize the side effects of DOX. Graphene oxide (GO), a new type of nanomaterial in the carbon family, was prepared by Hummers method and used as adsorbent for DOX from aqueous solution. The physico-chemical properties of GO were characterized by transmission electron microscope (TEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), zeta potential, and element analysis. The adsorption properties of DOX on GO were studied as a function of contact time, adsorbent dosage, temperature and pH value. The results showed that GO had a maximum adsorption capacity of 1428.57 mg/g and the adsorption isotherm data fitted the Langmuir model. The kinetics of adsorption fits a pseudo-second-order model. The thermodynamic studies indicate that the adsorption of DOX on GO is spontaneous and endothermic in nature.},

ABSTRACT = {The propagation of low intensity ultrasound in a curing resin, acting as a high frequency oscillatory excitation, has been recently proposed as an ultrasonic dynamic mechanical analysis (UDMA) for cure monitoring. The technique measures sound velocity and attenuation, which are very sensitive to changes in the viscoelastic characteristics of the curing resin, since the velocity is related to the resin storage modulus and density, while the attenuation is related to the energy dissipation and scattering in the curing resin. The paper reviews the results obtained by the authors’ research group in the last decade by means of in-house made ultrasonic set-ups for both contact and air-coupled ultrasonic experiments. The basics of the ultrasonic wave propagation in polymers and examples of measurements of the time-evolution of ultrasonic longitudinal modulus and chemical conversion of different thermosetting resins are presented. The effect of temperature on the cure kinetics, the comparison with rheological, low frequency dynamic mechanical and calorimetric results, and the correlation between ultrasonic modulus and crosslinking density will be also discussed. The paper highlights the reliability of ultrasonic wave propagation for monitoring the physical changes taking place during curing and the potential for online monitoring during polymer and polymer matrix composite processing.},

ABSTRACT = {Magnetite nanoparticles (Fe3O4) represent the most promising materials in medical applications. To favor high-drug or enzyme loading on the nanoparticles, they are incorporated into mesoporous materials to form a hybrid support with the consequent reduction of magnetization saturation. The direct synthesis of mesoporous structures appears to be of interest. To this end, magnetite nanoparticles have been synthesized using a one pot co-precipitation reaction at room temperature in the presence of different bases, such as NaOH, KOH or (C2H5)4NOH. Magnetite shows characteristics of superparamagnetism at room temperature and a saturation magnetization (Ms) value depending on both the crystal size and the degree of agglomeration of individual nanoparticles. Such agglomeration appears to be responsible for the formation of mesoporous structures, which are affected by the pH, the nature of alkali, the slow or fast addition of alkaline solution and the drying modality of synthesized powders.},

ABSTRACT = {Friction Stir Welding (FSW) is a solid-state joining process; i.e., no melting occurs. The welding process is promoted by the rotation and translation of an axis-symmetric non-consumable tool along the weld centerline. Thus, the FSW process is performed at much lower temperatures than conventional fusion welding, nevertheless it has some disadvantages. Laser Assisted Friction Stir Welding (LAFSW) is a combination in which the FSW is the dominant welding process and the laser pre-heats the weld. In this work FSW and LAFSW tests were conducted on 6 mm thick 5754H111 aluminum alloy plates in butt joint configuration. LAFSW is studied firstly to demonstrate the weldability of aluminum alloy using that technique. Secondly, process parameters, such as laser power and temperature gradient are investigated in order to evaluate changes in microstructure, micro-hardness, residual stress, and tensile properties. Once the possibility to achieve sound weld using LAFSW is demonstrated, it will be possible to explore the benefits for tool wear, higher welding speeds, and lower clamping force.},

ABSTRACT = {Laminated composites are increasingly used in aeronautics and the wind energy industry, as well as in the automotive industry. In these applications, the construction and processing need to fulfill the highest requirements regarding weight and mechanical properties. Environmental issues, like fuel consumption and CO2-footprint, set new challenges in producing lightweight parts that meet the highly monitored standards for these branches. In the automotive industry, one main aspect of construction is the impact behavior of structural parts. To verify the quality of parts made from composite materials with little effort, cost and time, non-destructive test methods are increasingly used. A highly recommended non-destructive testing method is thermography analysis. In this work, a prototype for a car’s base plate was produced by using vacuum infusion. For research work, testing specimens were produced with the same multi-layer build up as the prototypes. These specimens were charged with defined loads in impact tests to simulate the effect of stone chips. Afterwards, the impacted specimens were investigated with thermography analysis. The research results in that work will help to understand the possible fields of application and the usage of thermography analysis as the first quick and economic failure detection method for automotive parts.},

ABSTRACT = {Wear debris, of deferent sizes, shapes and quantities, generated in artificial hip and knees is largely confined to the bone and joint interface. This debris interacts with periprosthetic tissue and may cause aseptic loosening. The purpose of this review is to summarize and collate findings of the recent demonstrations on debris characterization and their biological response that influences the occurrence in implant migration. A systematic review of peer-reviewed literature is performed, based on inclusion and exclusion criteria addressing mainly debris isolation, characterization, and biologic responses. Results show that debris characterization largely depends on their appropriate and accurate isolation protocol. The particles are found to be non-uniform in size and non-homogeneously distributed into the periprosthetic tissues. In addition, the sizes, shapes, and volumes of the particles are influenced by the types of joints, bearing geometry, material combination, and lubricant. Phagocytosis of wear debris is size dependent; high doses of submicron-sized particles induce significant level of secretion of bone resorbing factors. However, articles on wear debris from engineered surfaces (patterned and coated) are lacking. The findings suggest considering debris morphology as an important parameter to evaluate joint simulator and newly developed implant materials.},

ABSTRACT = {The aim of this paper is to find out new alternative materials that respond to sustainable development criteria. For this purpose, an original utilization of straw for the design of lightweight aggregate concretes is proposed. Four types of straw were used: three wheat straws and a barley straw. In the present study, the morphology and the porosity of the different straw aggregates was studied by SEM in order to understand their effects on the capillary structure and the hygroscopic behavior. The physical properties such as sorption-desorption isotherms, water absorption coefficient, pH, electrical conductivity and thermo-gravimetric analysis were also studied. As a result, it has been found that this new vegetable material has a very low bulk density, a high water absorption capacity and an excellent hydric regulator. The introduction of the straw in the water tends to make the environment more basic; this observation can slow carbonation of the binder matrix in the presence of the straw.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, Nd3+–Yb3+–Er3+-doped β-NaYF4 nanocrystals with different Nd3+ concentrations are synthesized, and the luminescence properties of the upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) have been studied under 808-nm excitation for sensitive biological applications. The upconversion luminescence spectra of NaYF4 nanoparticles with different dopants under 808-nm excitation proves that the Nd3+ ion can absorb the photons effectively, and the Yb3+ ion can play the role of an energy-transfer bridging ion between the Nd3+ ion and Er3+ ion. To investigate the effect of the Nd3+ ion, the decay curves of the 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 transition at 540 nm are measured and analyzed. The NaYF4: 20% Yb3+, 2% Er3+, 0.5% Nd3+ nanocrystals have the highest emission intensity among all samples under 808-nm excitation. The UC (upconversion) mechanism under 808-nm excitation is discussed in terms of the experimental results.},

ABSTRACT = {Plasmon-mediated shape conversion of spherical silver nanoparticles (NPs) to nanostructures with other shapes under the irradiation of green LEDs (520 ± 20 nm, 35 mw/cm2) at various temperatures (60, 40, 20, 10, 5, and 0 °C) was performed in this study. It was found that the bath temperature used in the reaction can influence the reaction rates, i.e., the times needed for the shape transformation process were 5, 11.5, 25, 45, 72, and 100 h at 60, 40, 20, 10, 5, and 0 °C, respectively. In addition, the bath temperature can also alter the morphologies of the final products. The major products are silver nanoplates at 60, 40 and 20 °C. However, they became decahedral silver NPs at 5 and 0 °C. The percentages of decahedral silver NPs synthesized at 60, 40, 20, 10, 5, and 0 °C are 0%, 1%, 5%, 45%, 73%, and 89%, respectively. Measuring the surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) spectra of the probe molecule R6G in the presence of KBr showed that both silver nanoplate colloids synthesized at 60 °C and decahedral silver NP colloids synthesized at 0 °C in the absence of PVP had good SERS activities.},

ABSTRACT = {Protein based films are nowadays also prepared with the aim of replacing expensive, crude oil-based polymers as environmentally friendly and renewable alternatives. The protein structure determines the ability of protein chains to form intra- and intermolecular bonds, whereas the degree of cross-linking depends on the amino acid composition and molecular weight of the protein, besides the conditions used in film preparation and processing. The functionality varies significantly depending on the type of protein and affects the resulting film quality and properties. This paper reviews the methods used in examination of molecular interactions in protein films and discusses how these intermolecular interactions can be quantified. The qualitative determination methods can be distinguished by structural analysis of solutions (electrophoretic analysis, size exclusion chromatography) and analysis of solid films (spectroscopy techniques, X-ray scattering methods). To quantify molecular interactions involved, two methods were found to be the most suitable: protein film swelling and solubility. The importance of non-covalent and covalent interactions in protein films can be investigated using different solvents. The research was focused on whey protein, whereas soy protein and wheat gluten were included as further examples of proteins.},

ABSTRACT = {A new design and analysis of a wide-band double-negative metamaterial, considering a frequency range of 0.5 to 7 GHz, is presented in this paper. Four different unit cells with varying design parameters are analyzed to evaluate the effects of the unit-cell size on the resonance frequencies of the metamaterial. Moreover, open and interconnected 2 × 2 array structures of unit cells are analyzed. The finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method, based on the Computer Simulation Technology (CST) Microwave Studio, is utilized in the majority of this investigation. The experimental portion of the study was performed in a semi-anechoic chamber. Good agreement is observed between the simulated and measured S parameters of the developed unit cell and array. The designed unit cell exhibits negative permittivity and permeability simultaneously at S-band (2.95 GHz to 4.00 GHz) microwave frequencies. In addition, the designed unit cell can also operate as a double-negative medium throughout the C band (4.00 GHz to 4.95 GHz and 5.00 GHz to 5.57 GHz). At a number of other frequencies, it exhibits a single negative value. The two array configurations cause a slight shift in the resonance frequencies of the metamaterial and hence lead to a slight shift of the single- and double-negative frequency ranges of the metamaterial.},

ABSTRACT = {Lignin-based polyols were synthesized through microwave-assisted liquefaction under different microwave heating times (5–30 min). The liquefaction reactions were carried out using polyethylene glycol (PEG-400)/glycerol as liquefying solvents and 97 wt% sulfur acid as a catalyst at 140 °C. The polyols obtained were analyzed for their yield, composition and structural characteristics using gel permeation chromatography (GPC), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra. FT-IR and NMR spectra showed that the liquefying solvents reacted with the phenol hydroxyl groups of the lignin in the liquefied product. With increasing microwave heating time, the viscosity of polyols was slightly increased and their corresponding molecular weight (MW) was gradually reduced. The optimal condition at the microwave heating time (5 min) ensured a high liquefaction yield (97.47%) and polyol with a suitable hydroxyl number (8.628 mmol/g). Polyurethane (PU) foams were prepared by polyols and methylene diphenylene diisocyanate (MDI) using the one-shot method. With the isocyanate/hydroxyl group ([NCO]/[OH]) ratio increasing from 0.6 to 1.0, their mechanical properties were gradually increased. This study provided some insight into the microwave-assisted liquefied lignin polyols for the production of rigid PU foam.},

Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of electrospun fibers (23% w/v PS solution with applied voltage of 15 kV) showed that a new type of fiber with double-strand morphology was formed when the mass ratio of DMF and THF was 50/50 and 25/75. The tensile strength of the PS fiber film was 1.5 MPa, indicating strong reinforcement from double-strand fibers. Bead-free fibers were obtained by electrospinning 40% (w/v) PS/DMF solution at an applied voltage of 15 kV. Notably, when the ratio of DMF and THF was 100/0, the maximum contact angle (CA) value of the electrospun PS films produced at 15 kV was 148°.},

ABSTRACT = {In the present study, the dissolution and precipitation behaviour of four different aluminium alloys (EN AW-6005A, EN AW-6082, EN AW-6016, and EN AW-6181) in four different initial heat treatment conditions (T4, T6, overaged, and soft annealed) was investigated during heating in a wide dynamic range. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used to record heating curves between 20 and 600 °C. Heating rates were studied from 0.01 K/s to 5 K/s. We paid particular attention to control baseline stability, generating flat baselines and allowing accurate quantitative evaluation of the resulting DSC curves. As the heating rate increases, the individual dissolution and precipitation reactions shift to higher temperatures. The reactions during heating are significantly superimposed and partially run simultaneously. In addition, precipitation and dissolution reactions are increasingly suppressed as the heating rate increases, whereby exothermic precipitation reactions are suppressed earlier than endothermic dissolution reactions. Integrating the heating curves allowed the enthalpy levels of the different initial microstructural conditions to be quantified. Referring to time–temperature–austenitisation diagrams for steels, continuous heating dissolution diagrams for aluminium alloys were constructed to summarise the results in graphical form. These diagrams may support process optimisation in heat treatment shops.},

ABSTRACT = {Inorganic-organic hydride perovskites bring the hope for fabricating low-cost and large-scale solar cells. At the beginning of the research, two open questions were raised: the hysteresis effect and the role of chloride. The presence of chloride significantly improves the crystallization and charge transfer property of the perovskite. However, though the long held debate over of the existence of chloride in the perovskite seems to have now come to a conclusion, no prior work has been carried out focusing on the role of chloride on the electronic performance and the crystallization of the perovskite. Furthermore, current reports on the crystal structure of the perovskite are rather confusing. This article analyzes the role of chloride in CH3NH3PbI3-xClx on the crystal orientation and provides a new explanation about the (110)-oriented growth of CH3NH3PbI3 and CH3NH3PbI3-xClx.},

ABSTRACT = {Reduction of unwanted light reflection from a surface of a substance is very essential for improvement of the performance of optical and photonic devices. Antireflective coatings (ARCs) made of single or stacking layers of dielectrics, nano/microstructures or a mixture of both are the conventional design geometry for suppression of reflection. Recent progress in theoretical nanophotonics and nanofabrication has enabled more flexibility in design and fabrication of miniaturized coatings which has in turn advanced the field of ARCs considerably. In particular, the emergence of plasmonic and metasurfaces allows for the realization of broadband and angular-insensitive ARC coatings at an order of magnitude thinner than the operational wavelengths. In this review, a short overview of the development of ARCs, with particular attention paid to the state-of-the-art plasmonic- and metasurface-based antireflective surfaces, is presented.},

ABSTRACT = {Halloysite (HNT) is treated with sulfuric acid and the physico-chemical properties of its morphology, surface activity, physical and chemical properties have been investigated when HNT is exposed to sulfuric acid with treatment periods of 1 h (H1), 3 h (H3), 8 h (H8), and 21 h (H21). The significance of this and similar work lies in the importance of using HNT as a functional material in nanocomposites. The chemical structure was characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The spectrum demonstrates that the hydroxyl groups were active for grafting modification using sulfuric acid, promoting a promising potential use for halloysite in ceramic applications as filler for novel clay-polymer nanocomposites. From the X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectrum, it can be seen that the sulfuric acid breaks down the HNT crystal structure and alters it into amorphous silica. In addition, the FESEM images reveal that the sulfuric acid treatment dissolves the AlO6 octahedral layers and induces the disintegration of SiO4 tetrahedral layers, resulting in porous nanorods. The Bruncher-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area and total pore volume of HNTs showed an increase. The reaction of the acid with both the outer and inner surfaces of the nanotubes causes the AlO6 octahedral layers to dissolve, which leads to the breakdown and collapse of the tetrahedral layers of SiO4. The multi-fold results presented in this paper serve as a guide for further HNT functional treatment for producing new and advanced nanocomposites.},

ABSTRACT = {In this study, we devised a novel nanofibrous adsorbent made of polyethersulfone (PES) for removal of methylene blue (MB) dye pollutant from water. The polymer shows a low isoelectric point thus at elevated pHs and, being nanofibrous, can offer a huge highly hydroxylated surface area for adsorption of cationic MB molecules. As an extra challenge, to augment the adsorbent’s properties in terms of adsorption capacity in neutral and acidic conditions and thermal stability, vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) nanoparticles were added to the nanofibers. Adsorption data were analyzed according to the Freundlich adsorption model. The thermodynamic parameters verified that only at basic pH is the adsorption spontaneous and in general the process is entropy-driven and endothermic. The kinetics of the adsorption process was evaluated by the pseudo-first- and pseudo-second-order models. The latter model exhibited the highest correlation with data. In sum, the adsorbent showed a promising potential for dye removal from industrial dyeing wastewater systems, especially when envisaging their alkaline and hot conditions.},

ABSTRACT = {A preliminary study of the mechanical properties of auxetic cellular material consisting of re-entrant hexagonal honeycombs is presented. For different scales of the honeycombs, the finite element method (FEM) and experimental models are used to perform a parametric analysis on the effects of the Poisson’s ratio (cell angle) and the relative density (cell thickness) of honeycombs on bearing capacity and dynamic performance of the auxetic material. The analysis demonstrates that the ultimate bearing capacity of the presented auxetic cellular material is scale-independent when the Poisson’s ratio and the relative density are kept constant. The relationship between the geometric parameters and vibration level difference of the honeycombs is also revealed, which can be divided into two converse parts around the Poisson’s ratio v = − 1.5 . When v is smaller than −1.5, increasing the cell thickness leads to an increase in the vibration level difference of the honeycombs. Moreover, the dynamic performance of thin-walled honeycombs is greatly influenced by the scale of the honeycombs, especially for the ones with small Poisson’s ratio. These conclusions are verified by a frequency response test and a good agreement between the numerical results and experimental data is achieved.},

ABSTRACT = {A simple design of an ultrathin six-band polarization-insensitive terahertz perfect metamaterial absorber (PMMA), composed of a metal cross-cave patch resonator (CCPR) placed over a ground plane, was proposed and investigated numerically. The numerical simulation results demonstrate that the average absorption peaks are up to 95% at six resonance frequencies. Owing to the ultra-narrow band resonance absorption of the structure, the designed PMMA also exhibits a higher Q factor (>65). In addition, the absorption properties can be kept stable for both normal incident transverse magnetic (TM) and transverse electric (TE) waves. The physical mechanism behind the observed high-level absorption is illustrated by the electric and power loss density distributions. The perfect absorption originates mainly from the higher-order multipolar plasmon resonance of the structure, which differs sharply from most previous studies of PMMAs. Furthermore, the resonance absorption properties of the PMMA can be modified and adjusted easily by varying the geometric parameters of the unit cell.},

ABSTRACT = {Kraft lignin (KL) was thermally treated at 500 to 1000 °C in an inert atmosphere. Carbon nanostructure parameters of thermally treated KL in terms of amorphous carbon fraction, aromaticity, and carbon nanocrystallites lateral size (La), thickness (Lc), and interlayer space (d002) were analyzed quantitatively using X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. Experimental results indicated that increasing temperature reduced amorphous carbon but increased aromaticity in thermally treated KL materials. The Lc value of thermally treated KL materials averaged 0.85 nm and did not change with temperature. The d002 value decreased from 3.56 Å at 500 °C to 3.49 Å at 1000 °C. The La value increased from 0.7 to 1.4 nm as temperature increased from 500 to 1000 °C. A nanostructure model was proposed to describe thermally treated KL under 1000 °C. The thermal stability of heat treated KL increased with temperature rising from 500 to 800 °C.},

ABSTRACT = {ZnO, Al-doped ZnO (AZO), and Ga-doped ZnO (GZO) semiconductor thin films were deposited on glass substrates via a sol-gel spin-coating process for application in a photoconductive ultraviolet (UV) detector. The doping concentrations of Al and Ga were 1.0 at % in the precursor solutions. In this study, the microstructural features and the optical and electrical properties of sol-gel-derived ZnO, AZO, and GZO thin films were compared, and the performance of ZnO-based UV photodetectors under ultraviolet A (UVA) light were measured. Experimental results confirmed the synthesis of single-phase nanocrystalline ZnO-based thin films and the successful substitution of Al and Ga into Zn sites in ZnO crystals. The results also demonstrated that the optical transmittance and electrical properties of ZnO thin films could be improved by Al and Ga doping. UV photodetectors based on ZnO-based thin films, having a metal-semiconductor-metal (MSM) configuration, were fabricated with Al inter-digitated electrodes. All photodetectors showed an ohmic nature between semiconductor and electrode contacts and exhibited a sharp increase in photocurrent under illumination with UVA light. We found that the MSM UV photodetector based on the GZO semiconductor thin film exhibited the best UV response (IUVA/Idark) of 73.3 and the highest photocurrent responsivity of 46.2 A/W under UVA light (power density ~0.825 mW/cm2) at 5 V bias.},

In the course of the experiments, compressive strength of concrete and fracture toughness for: I (tensile), II (in-plane shear) and III (anti-plane shear) models of cracking were measured. The tests determined the effect of age of concretes modified with LCFA on the analyzed parameters. The experiments were carried out after: 3, 7, 28, 90, 180 and 365 days of curing. Fracture toughness of concretes was determined in terms of the critical stress intensity factors: K I c S , K I I c , K I I I c and then a generalized fracture toughness K c was specified. The obtained results are significant for the analysis of concrete structures subjected to complex loading. The properties of composites with the additive of LCFA depend on the age of the concrete tested. Mature concretes exhibit high fracture toughness at 20% additive of LCFA, while the additive of LCFA in the amount of 30% weight of cement has a beneficial effect on the parameters of concrete only after half a year of curing.},

ABSTRACT = {SnO2 and F doped SnO2 (FTO) nanoparticles (NPs) have been synthesized by the hydrothermal method with subsequent annealing at 500 °C. The microstructure and photoluminescence (PL) property of SnO2 and FTO NPs have been investigated, and an assumption model about the luminescence process of FTO NPs has been proposed. All of the SnO2 and FTO NPs possess polycrystalline tetragonal rutile structures, and the average size in the range of 16.5–20.2 nm decreases with the increasing of F doping content. The doping element F is shown a uniformly distribution by electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) mapping. The oxygen vacancy concentration becomes higher as is verified by Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS). There are three kinds of oxygen chemical states in SnO2 and FTO NPs, in which Oα corresponds to oxygen vacancies. The room temperature PL position is observed to be independent of F doping content. F− may substitute O2− into the SnO2 lattice by generating F O + and one extra e−, which can combine with V O + or V O + + to generate V O 0 or V O + to ensure charge balance.},

ABSTRACT = {Low-temperature cracking is one of the most common road pavement distress types in Poland. While bitumen performance can be evaluated in detail using bending beam rheometer (BBR) or dynamic shear rheometer (DSR) tests, none of the normalized test methods gives a comprehensive representation of low-temperature performance of the asphalt mixtures. This article presents the Bending Beam Creep test performed at temperatures from −20 °C to +10 °C in order to evaluate the low-temperature performance of asphalt mixtures. Both validation of the method and its utilization for the assessment of eight types of wearing courses commonly used in Poland were described. The performed test indicated that the source of bitumen and its production process (and not necessarily only bitumen penetration) had a significant impact on the low-temperature performance of the asphalt mixtures, comparable to the impact of binder modification (neat, polymer-modified, highly modified) and the aggregate skeleton used in the mixture (Stone Mastic Asphalt (SMA) vs. Asphalt Concrete (AC)). Obtained Bending Beam Creep test results were compared with the BBR bitumen test. Regression analysis confirmed that performing solely bitumen tests is insufficient for comprehensive low-temperature performance analysis.},

ABSTRACT = {In the study we experimentally examine the influence of elastic properties and surface morphology on the inter-particle friction of natural soil grains. The experiments are conducted with a custom-built micromechanical apparatus and the database is enhanced by testing engineered-reference grains. Naturally-occurring geological materials are characterized by a wide spectrum of mechanical properties (e.g., Young’s modulus) and surface morphology (e.g., roughness), whereas engineered grains have much more consistent characteristics. Comparing to engineered materials, geological materials are found to display more pronounced initial plastic behavior during compression. Under the low normal load range applied in the study, between 1 and 5 N, we found that the frictional force is linearly correlated with the applied normal load, but we acknowledge that the data are found more scattered for natural soil grains, especially for rough and weathered materials which have inconsistent characteristics. The inter-particle coefficient of friction is found to be inversely correlated with the Young’s modulus and the surface roughness. These findings are important in geophysical and petroleum engineering contents, since a number of applications, such as landslides and granular flows, hydraulic fracturing using proppants, and weathering process of cliffs, among others, can be simulated using discrete numerical methods. These methods employ contact mechanics properties at the grain scale and the inter-particle friction is one of these critical components. It is stressed in our study that friction is well correlated with the elastic and morphological characteristics of the grains.},

ABSTRACT = {Fused-deposition modeling (FDM), one of the additive manufacturing (AM) technologies, is an advanced digital manufacturing technique that produces parts by heating, extruding and depositing filaments of thermoplastic polymers. The properties of FDM-produced parts apparently depend on the processing parameters. These processing parameters have conflicting advantages that need to be investigated. This article focuses on an investigation into the effect of these parameters on the flexural properties of FDM-produced parts. The investigation is carried out on high-performance ULTEM 9085 material, as this material is relatively new and has potential application in the aerospace, military and automotive industries. Five parameters: air gap, raster width, raster angle, contour number, and contour width, with a full factorial design of the experiment, are considered for the investigation. From the investigation, it is revealed that raster angle and raster width have the greatest effect on the flexural properties of the material. The optimal levels of the process parameters achieved are: air gap of 0.000 mm, raster width of 0.7814 mm, raster angle of 0°, contour number of 5, and contour width of 0.7814 mm, leading to a flexural strength of 127 MPa, a flexural modulus of 2400 MPa, and 0.081 flexural strain.},

ABSTRACT = {We present a simple design for a broadband tunable terahertz (THz) metamaterial absorber (MMA) consisting of a complementary cross-oval-shaped graphene (CCOSG) structure and dielectric substrate placed on a continuous metal film. Both numerical simulation and theoretical calculation results indicate that the absorbance is greater than 80% from 1.2 to 1.8 THz, and the corresponding relative bandwidth is up to 40%. Simulated electric field and power loss density distributions reveal that the broadband absorption mainly originates from the excitation of continuous surface plasmon resonance (SPR) on the CCOSG. In addition, the MMA is polarization-insensitive for both transverse-electric (TE) and transverse-magnetic (TM) modes due to the geometry rotational symmetry of the unit-cell structure. Furthermore, the broadband absorption properties of the designed MMA can be effectively tunable by varying the geometric parameters of the unit-cell and chemical potential of graphene. Our results may find promising applications in sensing, detecting, and optoelectronic-related devices.},

ABSTRACT = {On the basis of dielectric measurements performed in a wide temperature range (173–373 K), a comprehensive analysis of the dielectric and electrical properties of magnetite nanoparticles electrical conduction mechanism of compressed spherical shaped Fe3O4 nanoparticles was proposed. The electrical conductivity of Fe3O4 nanoparticles was related to two different mechanisms (correlated barrier hopping and non-overlapping small polaron tunneling mechanisms); the transition between them was smooth. Additionally, role of grains and grain boundaries with charge carrier mobility and with observed hopping mechanism was described in detail. It has been confirmed that conductivity dispersion (as a function of frequencies) is closely related to both the long-range mobility (conduction mechanism associated with grain boundaries) and to the short-range mobility (conduction mechanism associated with grains). Calculated electron mobility increases with temperature, which is related to the decreasing value of hopping energy for the tunneling of small polarons. The opposite scenario was observed for the value of electron hopping energy.},

The MSH characterization has been carried out using a range of analytical techniques. Quantitative analysis was achieved using thermogravimetric analysis (TG/DTG) with a de-convolution technology. The structure of MSH gel was characterized using solid state nuclear magnetic resonance (29Si NMR) and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to investigate MSH microstructure. Compared with natural magnesium silicate hydrate minerals, the structure of MSH gel is highly disordered and generates on the surface of particles, producing a shell structure with cavity. The molecular structure of MSH phase is layered. The results also show that the extent of polymerization of MSH gel is related to the solution pH during hydration.},

As a result, there is a growing interest in employing a wide variety of approaches to detect trace explosive residues. Spectroscopy-based techniques play an irreplaceable role for the detection of energetic substances due to the advantages of rapid, automatic, and non-contact. The present work provides a comprehensive review of the advances made over the past few years in the fields of the applications of terahertz (THz) spectroscopy; laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS), Raman spectroscopy; and ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) for trace explosives detection. Furthermore, the advantages and limitations of various spectroscopy-based detection techniques are summarized. Finally, the future development for the detection of explosives is discussed.},

ABSTRACT = {Nitinol (nickel-titanium or Ni-Ti) is the most utilized shape memory alloy due to its good superelasticity, shape memory effect, low stiffness, damping, biocompatibility, and corrosion resistance. Various material characteristics, such as sensitivity to composition and production thermal gradients, make conventional methods ineffective for the manufacture of high quality complex Nitinol components. These issues can be resolved by modern additive manufacturing (AM) methods which can produce net or near-net shape parts with highly precise and complex Nitinol structures. Compared to Laser Engineered Net Shape (LENS), Selective Laser Melting (SLM) has the benefit of more easily creating a high quality local inert atmosphere which protects chemically-reactive Nitinol powders to a higher degree. In this paper, the most recent publications related to the SLM processing of Nitinol are reviewed to identify the various influential factors involved and process-related issues. It is reported how powder quality and material composition have a significant effect on the produced microstructures and phase transformations. The effect of heat treatments after SLM fabrication on the functional and mechanical properties are noted. Optimization of several operating parameters were found to be critical in fabricating Nitinol parts of high density. The importance of processing parameters and related thermal cooling gradient which are crucial for obtaining the correct phase structure for shape memory capabilities are also presented. The paper concludes by presenting the significant findings and areas of prospective future research in relation to the SLM processing of Nitinol.},

ABSTRACT = {One of the established limitations of metal additive manufacturing (AM) methods, such as selective laser melting (SLM), is the resulting rough surface finish. Laser polishing is one method that can be used to achieve an improved surface finish on AM printed parts. This study is focused on the laser surface polishing of AM parts using CO2 laser beam irradiation. Despite the fact that several researchers have investigated the traditional abrasive polishing method, there is still a lack of information reporting on the laser surface polishing of metal parts. In this study, AM 316L stainless steel cylindrical samples were polished using CO2 laser beam irradiation in continuous wave (CW) working mode. Two design of experiment models were developed for the optimization of the input processing parameters by statistical analysis of their effect on the resulting roughness. The processing parameters investigated were the laser beam power, the rotational speed of the sample, the number of laser scan passes, the laser beam focal position, and the percentage overlap of the laser tracks between consecutive passes. The characterization of the measured roughness and the modified layer microstructure was carried out using 3D optical and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). A maximum reduction of the roughness from 10.4 to 2.7 µm was achieved and no significant change in the microstructure phase type and micro-hardness was observed.},

ABSTRACT = {Environmental protection is the major concern of any form of manufacturing industry today. As focus has shifted towards sustainable cooling strategies, minimum quantity lubrication (MQL) has proven its usefulness. The current survey intends to make the MQL strategy more effective while improving its performance. A Ranque–Hilsch vortex tube (RHVT) was implemented into the MQL process in order to enhance the performance of the manufacturing process. The RHVT is a device that allows for separating the hot and cold air within the compressed air flows that come tangentially into the vortex chamber through the inlet nozzles. Turning tests with a unique combination of cooling technique were performed on titanium (Grade 2), where the effectiveness of the RHVT was evaluated. The surface quality measurements, forces values, and tool wear were carefully investigated. A combination of analysis of variance (ANOVA) and evolutionary techniques (particle swarm optimization (PSO), bacteria foraging optimization (BFO), and teaching learning-based optimization (TLBO)) was brought into use in order to analyze the influence of the process parameters. In the end, an appropriate correlation between PSO, BFO, and TLBO was investigated. It was shown that RHVT improved the results by nearly 15% for all of the responses, while the TLBO technique was found to be the best optimization technique, with an average time of 1.09 s and a success rate of 90%.},

ABSTRACT = {CAD/CAM (computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing) for indirect restorative materials has been recently introduced in dentistry. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the change of the surface micro-hardness of different restorative CAD/CAM materials after exposure to a carbonated acidic drink (Coca-Cola, Coca-Cola Company, Milan, Italy). One hundred and eighty specimens of identical size (2 mm thickness) were obtained by sectioning each tested CAD/CAM block of four materials: a hybrid ceramic (CERASMART™, GC Corporation, Tokyo, Japan), a resin nano ceramic (Lava™ Ultimate, 3M, Monrovia, CA, USA), a nanohybrid composite (Grandio blocs, VOCO GmbH, Cuxhaven, Germany), and a zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate glass ceramic (VITA SUPRINITY® PC; VITA Zahnfabrik, Bad Sackingen, Germany). Forty-five specimens of each material were tested. Micro-hardness was measured at baseline, after 7 days and after 28 days. The data were analyzed. The micro-hardness of each material varied significantly after immersion in Coca-Cola. The nanohybrid composite had a high initial micro-hardness and the greatest percentage loss after acid exposure. The hybrid ceramic and the resin nano ceramic had similar percentage losses of micro-hardness values even if the second material had higher initial values. The zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate glass ceramic had the highest baseline values and the lowest percentage loss of micro-hardness. The different CAD/CAM materials presented different micro-hardness values before and after acid exposure.},

ABSTRACT = {Reinforced concrete (RC) beams under cyclic loading usually suffer from reduced aggregate interlock and eventually weakened concrete compression zone due to severe cracking and the brittle nature of compressive failure. On the other hand, the addition of steel fibers can reduce and delay cracking and increase the flexural/shear capacity and the ductility of RC beams. The influence of steel fibers on the response of RC beams with conventional steel reinforcements subjected to reversal loading by a four-point bending scheme was experimentally investigated. Three slender beams, each 2.5 m long with a rectangular cross-section, were constructed and tested for the purposes of this investigation; two beams using steel fibrous reinforced concrete and one with plain reinforced concrete as the reference specimen. Hook-ended steel fibers, each with a length-to-diameter ratio equal to 44 and two different volumetric proportions (1% and 3%), were added to the steel fiber reinforced concrete (SFRC) beams. Accompanying, compression, and splitting tests were also carried out to evaluate the compressive and tensile splitting strength of the used fibrous concrete mixtures. Test results concerning the hysteretic response based on the energy dissipation capabilities (also in terms of equivalent viscous damping), the damage indices, the cracking performance, and the failure of the examined beams were presented and discussed. Test results indicated that the SFRC beam demonstrated improved overall hysteretic response, increased absorbed energy capacities, enhanced cracking patterns, and altered failure character from concrete crushing to a ductile flexural one compared to the RC beam. The non-fibrous reference specimen demonstrated shear diagonal cracking failing in a brittle manner, whereas the SFRC beam with 1% steel fibers failed after concrete spalling with satisfactory ductility. The SFRC beam with 3% steel fibers exhibited an improved cyclic response, achieving a pronounced flexural behavior with significant ductility due to the ability of the fibers to transfer the developed tensile stresses across crack surfaces, preventing inclined shear cracks or concrete spalling. A report of an experimental database consisting of 39 beam specimens tested under cyclic loading was also presented in order to establish the effectiveness of steel fibers, examine the fiber content efficiency and clarify their role on the hysteretic response and the failure mode of RC structural members.},

ABSTRACT = {The Terahertz’s wavelength is located between the microwave and the infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum. Because it is non-ionizing and non-invasive, Terahertz (THz)-based detection represents a very attractive tool for repeated assessments, patient monitoring, and follow-up. Cancer acts as the second leading cause of death in many regions, and current predictions estimate a continuous increasing trend. Of all types of tumors, digestive cancers represent an important percentage and their incidence is expected to increase more rapidly than other tumor types due to unhealthy lifestyle habits. Because it can precisely differentiate between different types of molecules, depending on water content, the information obtained through THz-based scanning could have several uses in the management of cancer patients and, more importantly, in the early detection of different solid tumors. The purpose of this manuscript is to offer a comprehensive overview of current data available on THz-based detection for digestive cancers. It summarizes the characteristics of THz waves and their interaction with tissues and subsequently presents available THz-based technologies (THz spectroscopy, THz-tomography, and THZ-endoscope) and their potential for future clinical use. The third part of the review is focused on highlighting current in vitro and in vivo research progress in the field, for identifying specific digestive cancers known as oral, esophageal, gastric, colonic, hepatic, and pancreatic tumors.},

ABSTRACT = {With the rapid development of nano-preparation processes, nanocrystalline materials have been widely developed in the fields of mechanics, electricity, optics, and thermal physics. Compared to the case of coarse-grained or amorphous materials, plastic deformation in nanomaterials is limited by the reduction in feature size, so that they generally have high strength, but the toughness is relatively high. The “reciprocal relationship” between the strength and toughness of nanomaterials limits the large-scale application and development of nanomaterials. Therefore, the maintenance of high toughness while improving the strength of nanomaterials is an urgent problem to be solved. So far, although the relevant mechanism affecting the deformation of nanocrystalline materials has made a big breakthrough, it is still not very clear. Therefore, this paper introduces the basic deformation type, mechanism, and model of single crystals, polycrystalline materials, and thin films, and aims to provide literature support for future research.},

ABSTRACT = {Bio-inspired functionally graded cellular materials (FGCM) have improved performance in energy absorption compared with a uniform cellular material (UCM). In this work, sheet-based and strut-based gyroid cellular structures with graded densities are designed and manufactured by stereo-lithography (SLA). For comparison, uniform structures are also designed and manufactured, and the graded structures are generated with different gradients. The mechanical behaviors of these structures under compressive loads are investigated. Furthermore, the anisotropy and effective elastic modulus of sheet-based and strut-based unit gyroid cellular structures are estimated by a numerical homogenization method. On the one hand, it is found from the numerical results that the sheet-based gyroid tends to be isotropic, and the elastic modulus of sheet-based gyroid is larger than the strut-based gyroid at the same volume fraction. On the other hand, the graded cellular structure has novel deformation and mechanical behavior. The uniform structure exhibits overall deformation and collapse behavior, whereas the graded cellular structure shows layer-by-layer deformation and collapse behavior. Furthermore, the uniform sheet-based gyroid is not only stiffer but also better in energy absorption capacity than the uniform strut-based gyroid structure. Moreover, the graded cellular structures have better energy absorption capacity than the uniform structures. These significant findings indicate that sheet-based gyroid cellular structure with graded densities have potential applications in various industrial applications, such as in crashworthiness.},

In light of this, the current work features recent data and major trends in spectroscopic analyses going from in vivo measurements up to ex vivo extracted and processed materials. The ability to offer insights into the structural variations underpinning pathogenesis of diseases could provide a platform for disease diagnosis and therapy effectiveness evaluation as a future standard clinical tool.},

ABSTRACT = {Due to the rapid growth of 3D printing popularity, including fused deposition modeling (FDM), as one of the most common technologies, the proper understanding of the process and influence of its parameters on resulting products is crucial for its development. One of the most crucial parameters of FDM printing is the raster angle and mutual arrangement of the following filament layers. Presented research work aims to evaluate different raster angles (45°, 55°, 55’°, 60° and 90°) on the static, as well as rarely investigated, dynamic mechanical properties of 3D printed acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) materials. Configuration named 55’° was based on the optimal winding angle in filament-wound pipes, which provides them exceptional mechanical performance and durability. Also in the case of 3D printed samples, it resulted in the best impact strength, comparing to other raster angles, despite relatively weaker tensile performance. Interestingly, all 3D printed samples showed surprisingly high values of impact strength considering their calculated brittleness, which provides new insights into understanding the mechanical performance of 3D printed structures. Simultaneously, it proves that, despite extensive research works related to FDM technology, there is still a lot of investigation required for a proper understanding of this process.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper investigates the ability of steel fibers to enhance the short-term behavior and flexural performance of realistic steel fiber-reinforced concrete (SFRC) structural members with steel reinforcing bars and stirrups using nonlinear 3D finite element (FE) analysis. Test results of 17 large-scale beam specimens tested under monotonic flexural four-point loading from the literature are used as an experimental database to validate the developed nonlinear 3D FE analysis and to study the contributions of steel fibers on the initial stiffness, strength, deformation capacity, cracking behavior, and residual stress. The examined SFRC beams include various ratios of longitudinal reinforcement (0.3%, 0.6%, and 1.0%) and steel fiber volume fractions (from 0.3% to 1.5%). The proposed FE analysis employs the nonlinearities of the materials with new and established constitutive relationships for the SFRC under compression and tension based on experimental data. Especially for the tensional response of SFRC, an efficient smeared crack approach is proposed that utilizes the fracture properties of the material utilizing special stress versus crack width relations with tension softening for the post-cracking SFRC tensile response instead of stress–strain laws. The post-cracking tensile behavior of the SFRC near the reinforcing bars is modeled by a tension stiffening model that considers the SFRC fracture properties, the steel fiber interaction in cracked concrete, and the bond behavior of steel bars. The model validation is carried out comparing the computed key overall and local responses and responses measured in the tests. Extensive comparisons between numerical and experimental results reveal that a reliable and computationally-efficient model captures well the key aspects of the response, such as the SFRC tension softening, the tension stiffening effect, the bending moment–curvature envelope, and the favorable contribution of the steel fibers on the residual response. The results of this study reveal the favorable influence of steel fibers on the flexural behavior, the cracking performance, and the post-cracking residual stress.},

ABSTRACT = {The use of fibers as mass reinforcement to delay cracking and to improve the strength and the post-cracking performance of reinforced concrete (RC) beams has been well documented. However, issues of common engineering practice about the beneficial effect of steel fibers to the seismic resistance of RC structural members in active earthquake zones have not yet been fully clarified. This study presents an experimental and a numerical approach to the aforementioned question. The hysteretic response of slender and deep steel fiber-reinforced concrete (SFRC) beams reinforced with steel reinforcement is investigated through tests of eleven beams subjected to reversal cyclic loading and numerical analysis using 3D finite element (FE) modeling. The experimental program includes flexural and shear-critical SFRC beams with different ratios of steel reinforcing bars (0.55% and 1.0%), closed stirrups (from 0 to 0.5%), and fibers with content from 0.5 to 3% per volume. The developed nonlinear FE numerical simulation considers well-established relationships for the compression and tensional behavior of SFRC that are based on test results. Specifically, a smeared crack model is proposed for the post-cracking behavior of SFRC under tension, which employs the fracture characteristics of the composite material using stress versus crack width curves with tension softening. Axial tension tests of prismatic SFRC specimens are also included in this study to support the experimental project and to verify the proposed model. Comparing the numerical results with the experimental ones it is revealed that the proposed model is efficient and accurately captures the crucial aspects of the response, such as the SFRC tension softening effect, the load versus deformation cyclic envelope and the influence of the fibers on the overall hysteretic performance. The findings of this study also reveal that SFRC beams showed enhanced cyclic behavior in terms of residual stiffness, load-bearing capacity, deformation, energy dissipation ability and cracking performance, maintaining their integrity through the imposed reversal cyclic tests.},

ABSTRACT = {The determination of the secure working life of polymeric materials is essential for their successful application in the packaging, medicine, engineering and consumer goods industries. An understanding of the chemical and physical changes in the structure of different polymers when exposed to long-term external factors (e.g., heat, ozone, oxygen, UV radiation, light radiation, chemical substances, water vapour) has provided a model for examining their ultimate lifetime by not only stabilization of the polymer, but also accelerating the degradation reactions. This paper presents an overview of the latest accounts on the impact of the most common environmental factors on the degradation processes of polymeric materials, and some examples of shelf life of rubber products are given. Additionally, the methods of lifetime prediction of degradable polymers using accelerated ageing tests and methods for extrapolation of data from induced thermal degradation are described: the Arrhenius model, time–temperature superposition (TTSP), the Williams–Landel–Ferry (WLF) model and 5 isoconversional approaches: Friedman’s, Ozawa–Flynn–Wall (OFW), the OFW method corrected by N. Sbirrazzuoli et al., the Kissinger–Akahira–Sunose (KAS) algorithm, and the advanced isoconversional method by S. Vyazovkin. Examples of applications in recent years are given.},

The main results and challenges of “pro-active strategies”, designed to ensure recyclability of new generations of wind turbines, are discussed. Among the main directions, the wind turbine blades with thermoplastic and recyclable thermoset composite matrices, as well as wood, bamboo and natural fiber-based composites were reviewed. It is argued that repair and reuse of wind turbine blades, and extension of the blade life has currently a number of advantages over other approaches. While new recyclable materials have been tested in laboratories, or in some cases on small or medium blades, there are remaining technological challenges for their utilization in large wind turbine blades.},
