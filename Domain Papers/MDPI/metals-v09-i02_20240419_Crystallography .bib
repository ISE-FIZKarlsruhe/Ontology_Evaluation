ABSTRACT = {This study examines the effects of size on the strength of materials, especially on high strength pearlitic steel wires. These wires play a central role in many long span suspension bridges and their design, construction, and maintenance are important for global public safety. In particular, two relationships have been considered to represent strength variation with respect to length parameters: (i) the strength versus inverse square-root and (ii) inverse length equations. In this study, existing data for the strength of high strength pearlitic steel wires is evaluated for the coefficient of determination (R2 values). It is concluded that the data fits into two equations equally well. Thus, the choice between two groups of theories that predict respective relationships must rely on the merit of theoretical developments and assumptions made.},

ABSTRACT = {Three-dimensional (3D) discrete dislocation dynamics simulations are used to analyze the size effect on the fractal dimension of two-dimensional (2D) and 3D dislocation microstructure. 2D dislocation structures are analyzed first, and the calculated fractal dimension ( n 2 ) is found to be consistent with experimental results gleaned from transmission electron microscopy images. The value of n 2 is found to be close to unity for sizes smaller than 300 nm, and increases to a saturation value of ≈1.8 for sizes above approximately 10 microns. It is discovered that reducing the sample size leads to a decrease in the fractal dimension because of the decrease in the likelihood of forming strong tangles at small scales. Dislocation ensembles are found to exist in a more isolated way at the nano- and micro-scales. Fractal analysis is carried out on 3D dislocation structures and the 3D fractal dimension ( n 3 ) is determined. The analysis here shows that ( n 3 ) is significantly smaller than ( n 2 + 1 ) of 2D projected dislocations in all considered sizes.},

ABSTRACT = {Metals in small volumes display a strong dependence on initial conditions, which translates into size effects and stochastic mechanical responses. In the context of crystal plasticity, this amounts to the role of pre-existing dislocation configurations that may emerge due to prior processing. Here, we study a minimal but realistic model of uniaxial compression of sub-micron finite volumes. We show how the statistical correlations of pre-existing dislocation configurations may influence the mechanical response in multi-slip crystal plasticity, in connection to the finite volume size and the initial dislocation density. In addition, spatial dislocation correlations display evidence that plasticity is strongly influenced by the formation of walls composed of bound dislocation dipoles.},

ABSTRACT = {Hierarchical structures of 20 nm grains embedded with twins are realized in electrodeposited Au–Cu alloys. The electrodeposition method allows refinement of the average grain size to 20 nm order, and the alloying stabilizes the nanoscale grain structure. Au–Cu alloys are face-centered cubic (FCC) metals with low stacking fault energy that favors formation of growth twins. Due to the hierarchical structure, the Hall–Petch relationship is still observed when the crystalline size (average twin space) is refined to sub 10 nm region. The yield strength reaches 1.50 GPa in an electrodeposited Au–Cu alloy composed of 16.6 ± 1.1 nm grains and the average twin spacing at 4.7 nm.},

ABSTRACT = {The influence of the grain structure on the tensile deformation strength is studied for precipitation-strengthened Cu-0.2%Zr at 673K. Subgrains and grains are formed by equal channel angular pressing (ECAP) and annealing. The fraction of high-angle boundaries increases with prestrain. Subgrains and grains coarsen during deformation. This leads to softening in the quasi-stationary state. The initial quasi-stationary state of severely predeformed, ultrafine-grained material exhibits relatively high rate-sensitivity at relatively high stresses. This is interpreted as a result of the stress dependences of the quasi-stationary subgrain size and the volume fraction of subgrain-free grains.},

ABSTRACT = {During quasi-stationary tensile deformation of ultrafine-grained Cu-0.2 mass%Zr at 673 K and a deformation rate of about 10−4 s−1 load changes were performed. Reductions of relative load by more than about 25% initiate anelastic back flow. Subsequently, the creep rate turns positive again and goes through a relative maximum. This is interpreted by a strain rate component ϵ ˙ − associated with dynamic recovery of dislocations. Back extrapolation indicates that ϵ ˙ − contributes the same fraction of ( 20 ± 10 ) % to the quasi-stationary strain rate that has been reported for coarse-grained materials with high fraction of low-angle boundaries; this suggests that dynamic recovery of dislocations is generally mediated by boundaries. The influence of anelastic back flow on ϵ ˙ − is discussed. Comparison of ϵ ˙ − to the quasi-stationary rate points to enhancement of dynamic recovery by internal stresses. Subtraction of ϵ ˙ − from the total rate yields the rate component ϵ ˙ + related with generation and storage of dislocations; its activation volume is in the order expected from the classical theory of thermal glide.},

The Charpy impact test was performed after extracting samples in directions both parallel and perpendicular to the deposition direction. In this study, multiple factors related to the resulting absorbed energy have been discussed. Despite being a layered structure, homogeneous behavior with acceptable deviation was observed in the microstructure, hardness, and fracture toughness of the structure in both directions. The fracture is extremely ductile with a dimpled fibrous surface and secondary cracks. An estimate for fracture toughness based on Charpy impact absorbed energy is also given.},

ABSTRACT = {The influence of grain shape and crystallographic orientation on the global and local elastic and plastic behaviour of strongly textured materials is investigated with the help of full-field simulations based on texture data from electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) measurements. To this end, eight different microstructures are generated from experimental data of a high-strength low-alloy (HSLA) steel processed by linear flow splitting. It is shown that the most significant factor on the global elastic stress–strain response (i.e., Young’s modulus) is the crystallographic texture. Therefore, simple texture-based models and an analytic expression based on the geometric mean to determine the orientation dependent Young’s modulus are able to give accurate predictions. In contrast, with regards to the plastic anisotropy (i.e., yield stress), simple analytic approaches based on the calculation of the Taylor factor, yield different results than full-field microstructure simulations. Moreover, in the case of full-field models, the selected microstructure representation influences the outcome of the simulations. In addition, the full-field simulations, allow to investigate the micro-mechanical fields, which are not readily available from the analytic expressions. As the stress–strain partitioning visible from these fields is the underlying reason for the observed macroscopic behaviour, studying them makes it possible to evaluate the microstructure representations with respect to their capabilities of reproducing experimental results.},

ABSTRACT = {An understanding of the crack initiation and crack growth in metals spanning the entire spectrum of conventional and advanced has long been a major scientific challenge. It is known that dislocations are involved both in the initiation and propagation of cracks in metals and alloys. In this review, we first describe the experimental observations of dislocation emission from cracks under stress. Then the role played by these dislocations in fatigue and fracture is considered at a fundamental level by considering the interactions of crack and dislocations emitted from the crack. We obtain precise expression for the equilibrium positions of dislocations in an array ahead of crack tip. We estimate important parameters, such as plastic zone size, dislocation free zone and dislocation stress intensity factor for the analysis of crack propagation. Finally, we describe very recent novel and significant results, such as residual stresses and relatively large lattice rotations across a number of grains in front of the crack that accompanies fatigue process.},

ABSTRACT = {Serration phenomena, in which stress fluctuates in a saw-tooth shape, occur when a uniaxial test is performed on an aluminum alloy containing a solid solution of solute atoms. The appearance of the serrations is affected by the strain rate and temperature. Indentation tests enable the evaluation of a wide range of strain rates in a single test and are a convenient test method for evaluating serration phenomena. Previously, the serrations caused by indentation at room temperature were clarified using strain rate as an index. In this study, we considered ambient temperature as another possible influential factor. We clarify, through experimentation, the effect of temperature on the serration phenomenon caused by indentation. An Al–Zn–Mg–Cu alloy (7075 aluminum alloy) was used as the specimen. The aging phenomenon was controlled by varying the testing temperature of the solution-treated specimen. Furthermore, the material properties obtained by indentation were evaluated. By varying the testing temperature, the presence and amount of precipitation were controlled and the number of solute atoms was varied. Additionally, the diffusion of solute atoms was controlled by maintaining the displacement during indentations, and a favorable environment for the occurrence of serrations was induced. The obtained results reveal that the variations in the serrations formed in the loading curvature obtained via indentation are attributed to the extent of interaction between the solute atoms and the dislocations.},

ABSTRACT = {In the present work, the deformation behavior and processing maps of a low-carbon Fe-2 wt% Nb steel were studied by means of hot-compression tests at temperatures of 800–1150 °C and strain rates of 0.01–10 s−1. The hot-processing maps at different strains and corresponding microstructural evolution were constructed and discussed. The hot-deformation behaviors of two different phase regions, i.e., austenite + NbC dual-phase and ferrite + NbC dual-phase, were predicted by determining the constitutive equations using Arrhenius-type and Zener–Hollomon models. The results suggest that the hot-deformed microstructures of the material present a strong correlation with the processing parameters in the hot-processing maps. In addition, the optimum parameters based on the processing maps were obtained, and the instable and the safe domains during the hot deformation in the hot-processing maps provide solid theoretical guidance for industrial production.},

ABSTRACT = {Retained austenite is a key feature used to realize the transformation-induced plasticity in bainitic high strength steels. In this study, the authors focused on the formation of metastable austenite in Fe-0.61C-1.9Si-0.98Mn (mass%) during isothermal heating processes using in situ neutron diffraction techniques. Quantitative discussion of carbon partitioning processes is enabled by applying an in situ phase fraction analysis considering crystallographic textures, in addition to the carbon concentration estimation based on the lattice parameter of austenite. The carbon partitioning behavior is inhomogeneous, resulting in a bimodal carbon concentration distribution in austenite. The carbon enriched, high carbon austenite is stable during isothermal heating at 673 K and is retained even after cooling to room temperature. The remainder is low carbon austenite, which is gradually consumed by bainite transformation. Above 723 K, the high carbon austenite also decomposes to ferrite and cementite due to the fast diffusion of Si. Conversely, below 623 K, cementite is stabilized even without the diffusion of Si. These cementite formation mechanisms prevent the formation and retention of high carbon austenite. The inhomogeneous carbon distribution and cementite formation must be carefully considered to precisely predict the microstructure formation in Si-added bainitic steels.},

ABSTRACT = {Floating particles often appear during the Czochralski (CZ) growth of β-Ga2O3 in the Ir crucible, thereby impeding the seeding process. Identifying the floating nanoparticles and then inhibiting or removing them is critical for growing high-quality β-Ga2O3 single crystals. We grew β-Ga2O3 crystals containing floating particles using the CZ method. It is indicated that the floating particles were composed of Ir with a face-centered cubic (fcc) structure. In addition, the β-Ga2O3/Ir interface was comprehensively characterized, showing sharp and straight configuration on the whole with small fluctuations at the nanoscale. Combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculation, we found that Ir-O bonding was responsible for stabilizing the interface. Accordingly, the atomic configuration of the interface with the stablest structure, including the relaxed one, was determined. Based on the formation mechanism of the floating particles, we propose three effective strategies, including blowing sufficient oxygen into the bottom of the Ir crucible, coating a protective layer on its inwall and equipping a mechanical arm for inhibiting or removing them.},

Fine grain strengthening is considered to increase the strength of metals without losing plasticity. However, many fabrication techniques are restricted to very small sizes.

In this review, the focus is on fabrication techniques and the formation mechanism of nanoparticles and nanoclusters in metal materials. The effects of nanoparticles on grain refinement, inhibiting segregation, second phase, and inclusion refinement are discussed, and the mechanism of simultaneous improvement in the strength and ductility of nanostructured metal materials is briefly covered. Finally, we provide a summary and outline of the possible direction for further advances in this research field.},

ABSTRACT = {Shear-coupled grain boundary motion (SCGBM) is an important mechanism of plastic deformation, especially in the cases of ultrafine-grained or nanocrystalline materials at low temperatures. Much research work has been focused on the geometric rules of coupling, the grain boundary migration mechanisms, or the temperature effect of SCGBM, but the effect of the alloy atoms is seldom involved. In this work, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were carried out to examine the SCGBM of the Σ17[110](223) and Σ9[110](221) grain boundaries (GBs) in iron-chromium alloys containing from 1 at.% to 9 at.% Cr. A constant shear velocity corresponding to 10 m/s parallel to the boundary plane was applied to the models. Our simulation results indicate that the critical stress of GB migration reduces due to the addition of Cr atoms for the Σ17(223) GB. As for the Σ9(221) GB, sliding occurs simultaneously with coupling in the shear process when the atomic amount of Cr reaches 3%. This phenomenon was also observed in the Σ9(221) GB in pure Fe when the temperature was elevated to 300 K, which was studied in our previous simulation work. The existence of new structural units was demonstrated to be responsible for the sliding of the grain boundary.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, the research progress on the strengthening of copper and copper alloy is reviewed. The research shows that traditional strengthening methods are often accompanied by the decrease of plasticity, and there are limitations in size, cost, and other aspects in the process. The in-situ nanoparticle strengthening and plasticizing technology proposed in recent years can avoid the above problems. In this paper, the idea of in-situ nanoparticle strengthening is introduced to realize the simultaneous enhancement of strength and ductility of as-cast pure copper and tin bronze alloys. The effects of in-situ precipitation of iron-rich nanoparticles on the microstructure, and mechanical properties of different copper alloy systems, are systematically elucidated based on the former characterization and mechanical testing results. The results show that the in-situ introduction of iron-rich nanoparticles in the copper systems induces the formation of a nano precipitate-fine grain (NPFG) structure, which greatly improves the strength and ductility of copper alloys. The evolution of size, distribution, number density, morphology evolution in iron-rich nanoparticles, and the formation mechanism of NPFG structure, as well as the mechanism of NPFG strengthening and toughening, are summarized. An industrial-applicable casting process is proposed to prepare bulk NPFG structured copper alloys with complex shape, high strength, and high ductility.},

ABSTRACT = {Herein, the effect of the shear flow on the growth of columnar crystals in an undercooled melt is studied. The asymptotic method is used to solve the dynamic model for the growth of a columnar crystal. The resulting asymptotic solution shows that the shear flow significantly changes the interface morphology of the columnar crystal. With the shear effect of the forced flow, the growth rate of the columnar interface increases in the shear direction of the shear flow. As the shear rate of the shear flow further increases, the interface of the columnar crystal is seriously deformed and distorted. The shear flow causes the columnar crystal in the undercooled melt to tend to evolve into smaller crystals in the initial stage of crystal growth. The analytical result provides a prediction of the formation of interface microstructures during solidification through the change of processing parameters.},

ABSTRACT = {The tungsten components in nuclear fusion reactors need to withstand the radiation cascade damage caused by the neutron bombardment of high temperature and high throughput fusion reaction during service. These damages are mainly present as a high concentration of point defects and clusters, which lead to a series of problems such as irradiation-hardening and decreased thermal conductivity of materials. In this study, molecular dynamics simulations are carried out to study the dynamic interaction between grain boundaries and the void in tungsten at high temperatures (T > 2500 K). Different interatomic potentials of W were tested, and the most appropriate one was selected by the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of W. Simulation results show that the dynamic migration of grain boundary can absorb the void, but the absorption efficiency of grain boundaries is sensitive to their structural characteristics, where the high-angle GBs are more absorptive to the void than the low-angle GBs. It is found that the void absorption cannot be completely attributed to the thermal diffusion mechanism during the GB-void interaction; the dynamic migration of high-angle GBs can significantly accelerate the void absorption. This study reveals a GB migration-induced self-healing mechanism of W at high temperatures.},

The microstructure of the material was investigated by scanning electron microscopy, electron backscattered diffraction, and transmission electron microscopy methods. Phase transformation follows the K–S orientation relationships. Interconnecting structures generate due to the variant interactions within one prior austenite grain. The multi-phase microstructure containing both soft and hard phases contributes to good plasticity. The homogeneously distributed NbC nanoparticles make up the loss of strength ascribed to the soft retained austenite and keep the strength at an extremely high level.},

ABSTRACT = {A new type of P91 heat-resistant pipeline steel ingot was prepared by feeding Al twisted wire into a steel melt through a multi-point regional micro-supply method, combined with electromagnetic stirring. The type, shape, and size of inclusions in the new P91 steel after forging were then analyzed by scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), and transmission electron microscope (TEM). The results showed that four types of inclusions were detected in the P91 steel, including: spherical independent Al2O3 inclusions, irregular Al2O3-SiO2 composite inclusions, nearly spherical MgO-Al2O3 composite inclusions, and spherical (Ca, Mg, Al) (O) composite inclusions. Compared with traditional P91 steel, the inclusions in the new P91 steel were significantly refined. Refining mechanisms of inclusion showed that Al2O3 oxide particles distributed dispersedly with fine sizes could be obtained through a multi-point regional micro-supply method. Further, Al2O3 particles act as the nucleation core to form a “core-shell” structure and play the role of a heterogeneous nucleation to refine SiO2, MgO, (Ca, Mg) (O), and other inclusions in the steel.},

ABSTRACT = {A new cellular automaton (CA) model of abnormal grain growth (AGG) that considers anisotropic grain boundary energies was developed in this paper. The anisotropic grain boundary energy was expressed based on two types of grains, which correspond to two components of different crystallographic orientation in textured materials. The CA model was established by assigning different grain boundary energies and grain-growth-driven mechanisms to four types of grain boundaries formed by two types of grains. The grain boundaries formed by different kinds of grains adopted the lowest energy principle, while the grain boundaries formed by the same kind of grains adopted the curvature-driven mechanism. The morphology calculated by the CA model shows the characteristics of AGG. Then, the Johnson–Mehl–Avrami (JMA) model was fitted to predict the growth kinetics. By analyzing the fitting results, the JMA model is capable of predicting the growth kinetics of AGG. The Avrami exponent p decreases from about 1.5 to 1 with the initial number of Type II grains increasing. The investigation of the Hillert model and grain size distribution further indicates that the microstructure evolution is consistent with AGG. Therefore, the analysis of morphology and kinetics indicates that AGG can be fairly well-simulated by the present CA model.},

The obtained microstructures can vary in size, type, distribution, location, formation, and interactions of multiple phases, which were observed and analyzed by optical microscopy (OM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and an energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS). The dendrite segregation behavior of as-cast superalloy GH4169 was investigated. In addition, the microstructural evolution mechanism of second-phase particles during dynamic recrystallization was analyzed. This work sheds light on the evolution of the second-phase structure of nickel-based superalloys during the preparation process, providing guidance for process development and visual interpretation of the relationships between microstructure and properties.},

The results indicated that gravity casting had much better melt-filling stability and synchronization, compared to centrifugal casting. Misrun defects in the upper edge of the thin-walled outer ring could be removed by increasing the bottom cross runners, and the negative effect of the overheated zone in the thick-walled flange could be reduced by designing a suitable inner-gate structure. The crack induced by stress concentration in the transition zone brought significant challenges for TiAl case casting and the issue would be effectively resolved through structural design and process optimization.},

ABSTRACT = {Liquid-liquid transitions were discovered above the melting temperature (Tm) in Bi and Sn up to 2 Tm, viewed as glass transitions at Tg = Tn+ > Tm of composites nucleated at Tx < Tm and fully melted at Tn+. A glassy fraction (f) disappeared at 784 K in Sn. (Tn+) increases with singular values of (f) depending on Tx with (f) attaining 100% at Tg = Tn+ = 2 Tm. The nonclassical model of homogeneous nucleation is used to predict Tx, Tn+ and the specific heat. The singular values of (f) leading to (Tn+) correspond to percolation thresholds of configurons in glassy phases. A phase diagram of glassy fractions occurring in molten elements is proposed. The same value of (Tx) can lead to multiple (Tg). Values of (Tg = Tn+) can be higher than (2 Tm) for Tx/Tm < 0.7069. A specific heat equal to zero is predicted after cooling from T ≤ 2 Tm and would correspond to a glassy phase. Weak glassy fractions are nucleated near (Tn+) after full melting at (Tm) without transition at (Tx). Resistivity decreases were observed after thermal cycling between solid and liquid states with weak and successive values of (f) due to Tx/Tm < 0.7069.},

ABSTRACT = {Effects of different pressures on the isothermal-solidification process of pure Al were studied by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation using the embedded-atom method (EAM). Al was first subjected to a rapid-cooling process, and then it was annealed under different pressures conditions. Mean first-passage times (MFPT) method, Johnson-Mehl-Avrami (JMA) law, and X-ray diffraction (XRD) simulation analysis method were used to qualify the solidification- kinetic processing. Nucleation rate, critical-nucleus size, Avrami exponent, growth exponent, and crystallite size were calculated. Results show that the nucleation rate increases as the pressure increases. The change of critical-nucleation size is not obvious as the pressure increases. With the pressure increasing, growth exponent decreases, indicative of decreased grain-growth rate. It was also found that with the pressure increasing, the Avrami exponent decreases, indicating that the increased pressure has an effect on growth modes during solidification, which changes from three-dimensional growth to one-dimensional growth. Results of XRD simulation shows that with pressure increasing, crystallite size decreases.},

ABSTRACT = {Maraging steels are precipitation hardening alloys that can achieve an ultra-high yield strength (~3 GPa), however associated with low toughness. During exposure to high temperatures, an oxidation process occurs on the surface of these steels, generally, the oxides formed are hematite and/or magnetite. The aim of this study was to investigate oxidation on a maraging 13Ni15Co10Mo at annealing temperature of 900 °C. The bulk microstructure was investigated by several complementary techniques and the oxidized surface was characterized by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray Diffraction (XRD). The results showed that the bulk microstructure, at annealed condition, consists of a lath martensite with a hardness of round 400 HV. The most external and oxidized surface contains the oxides hematite, magnetite and kamiokite. Finally, the presence of austenite was detected in the first 2 μm below the surface. Chemical microanalysis indicated that the austenite is stable at room temperature in this region due a composition gradient that makes this region rich in nickel and cobalt. The composition gradient is due atom diffusion during oxides formation. Austenite near to the surface is very convenient as it could avoid crack initiation and propagation, improving toughness.},

ABSTRACT = {As important structural features of the metal materials, chemical short-range ordering clusters play a critical role in the mechanical properties of the materials. They have been discovered in dilute Al-alloy systems and are usually generated by annealing processes at high temperatures or by severe plastic deformation at room temperature. In the present work, systematic first-principle calculations were conducted to evaluate the influences of the chemical short-range ordering clusters L12-Al3Zr on the mechanical properties of the pure Al supercell. Results showed that the mechanical properties including both ideal tensile strength and ductility were improved simultaneously when the chemical short-range ordering clusters L12-Al3Zr were introduced to the pure Al. The larger the volume fraction of chemical short-range ordering clusters L12-Al3Zr, the larger the ideal tensile strength. The deformation charge density, the electron localization function and the density of state were computed to reveal the nature of the strengthening of the chemical short-range ordering clusters L12-Al3Zr on the pure Al supercell. It was found that excellent ideal tensile strength for the Al supercell with the chemical short-range ordering clusters L12-Al3Zr was due to strong charge accumulations and strong electronic interactions between the solute atoms Zr and the host Al atoms. In addition, the Pugh ratio (B/G) and ratio (Wsep/Gdisl) of the work of the separation Wsep to the work of dislocation emission Gdisl were computed to reveal the effect of the chemical short-range ordering clusters L12-Al3Zr on the ductility of the Al supercell. Results showed that the addition of L12-Al3Zr chemical short-range ordering clusters addition to pure Al supercell brought about an increase in ductility as compared to pure Al supercell, which is ascribed to large the Pugh ratio B/G and ratio (Wsep/Gdisl) of the work of the separation Wsep to the work of dislocation emission Gdisl. This work is important for simultaneously improving the tensile strength and ductility of Al alloys.},

ABSTRACT = {Heusler alloy research has increased considerably in recent years. This is mostly due to their strong desire to develop future smart device applications. However, many limiting variables remain for researchers to overcome in order to enhance their functional properties. The poor mechanical properties of these alloys restrict their use as solid-state cooling materials in magnetic refrigeration devices. A promising strategy, resulting in novel compounds with better mechanical properties and substantial magnetocaloric effects, is favoring the d–d hybridization with transition-metal elements to replace p–d hybridization. The term given to these materials is “all-d-metal”. In light of recent experimental results of the magnetocaloric effect and the increased mechanical characteristics in these alloys (with complex crystallographic behavior due to off-stoichiometry and disorder), a review of this advanced functional behavior is offered. Moreover, the impact of the substitution of transition metal for the p-group to increase mechanical ductility and considerable magnetocaloric effects has also been addressed. These Heusler alloys are a potential new class of materials for technological applications because of their optimum functional behavior. Finally, we highlighted the potential challenges and unsolved issues in order to guide future studies on this topic.},

ABSTRACT = {Static indentation and dynamic indentation are reviewed, with a focus on extraction of material properties of isotropic strain-hardening polycrystalline metals that may be rate- and temperature-sensitive. Static indentation is reviewed first, followed by dynamic indentation, since the former is regarded as a specialization of the latter with inertia, rate dependence, and adiabatic heating excluded. Extending concepts from the literature review, a treatment of dynamic indentation using dimensional analysis is forwarded, and a general framework for extraction of material property information (i.e., constitutive model parameters) from instrumented dynamic spherical indentation experiments is set forth. In an example application of the methodology, experimental data obtained from instrumented spherical indentation in a miniature Kolsky bar apparatus are evaluated via dimensional analysis. The substrate material is aluminum alloy Al 6061-T6. Several definitions of indentation strain proposed for static indentation are assessed for dynamic indentation, as are indentation strain rates. While the fidelity of the experimental method and inertial effects could inhibit extraction of elastic properties, extraction of certain plastic constitutive properties may be feasible. Current data are insufficient to enable determination of a complete and unique set of all physical properties. Motivated by the present review and analysis, new experiments and simulations are proposed that would identify influences of material properties, facilitating their extraction from data.},

ABSTRACT = {In the current study, we concentrated on the influence of annealing on the magnetic behavior of Co2MnSi-based Heusler microwires. We set the annealing temperature at 1023 K for 2 h, as the sample did not show any significant changes in the magnetic properties at lower temperatures, while annealing at temperatures above 1023 K damages the glass coating. Strong in-plane magnetocrystalline anisotropy parallel to the microwire axis was evident in the magnetic behavior at room temperature for as-prepared and annealed samples. The coercivity of the annealed sample was four times higher than that of the as-prepared sample across a wide range of measuring temperatures. Both annealed and as-prepared samples exhibit quite stable coercivity behavior with temperature, which may have interesting applications. The an nealed sample did not exhibit magnetic saturation for M-H loops measured below 50 K. Sharp irreversible magnetic behavior has been detected for annealed samples at a blocking temperature of 220 K; at the same time, the blocking temperature for the as-prepared sample was 150 K. The strong internal mechanical stress induced during the fabrication of Co2MnSi microwires in addition to the internal stress relaxation caused by the annealing induced the onset of magnetic phases resulting in unusual and irreversible magnetic behavior.},

ABSTRACT = {This research revealed the response of Ga and Al sublattices to the incorporation of mismatching substituents in Gd3Al2Ga3O12:Ce single crystals. Incompatible in size and charge, Li+ and Mg2+ substituents violated configurational entropy. This led to lattice distortion and triggered structural rearrangements. The radial fluctuation of the Ga and Al elements was proven by multi-elemental energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy mapping and elemental composition analysis. Further evidence was observed by the shift of the exciton creation energy toward higher energy in the vacuum ultraviolet excitation spectra recorded with synchrotron radiation. In the Li+ and Mg2+ co-doped samples, the crystal core was depleted with Ga atoms and enriched with Al elements. The crystal rim showed the opposite behavior. The change in thermoluminescence peak positions revealed a different mechanism for the formation of localized traps. As a result, Li+ co-doping slightly improved the light yield value, but at the same time decelerated the scintillation decay time. On the contrary, Mg2+ co-doping markedly diminished scintillation parameters.},

ABSTRACT = {Shape memory alloys (SMAs) are types of materials that can restore their original shape upon severe or quasi-plastic deformation, being exposed to specific external stimuli, including heating, electric current, magnetic field, etc. They are a category of functional materials that provides superelasticity as a significant material property. The roots of this unintentional discovery were in the 20th century, and later it attracted the attention of various industries, including aerospace, medical, mechanical, manufacturing industries, etc. Later developments mainly focused on improving the properties of these materials. One of the ways in which this is achieved is the application of intensive plastic strains on SMAs through severe plastic deformation (SPD) methods, leading to extreme grain refinement. Superelasticity is a key characteristic of SMAs and is known as the capacity of a polycrystalline material to display extremely high elongations before failure, in a typically isotropic way, with an approximate strain rate of 0.5. Utilization of SPD techniques can also affect and lead to superior superelasticity responses in SMAs. Several SPD methodologies have been introduced over the decades, to produce ultrafine-grained and even nanostructured materials, including constrained groove pressing, equal-channel angular pressing, high-speed high-pressure torsion, accumulative roll bonding, etc. This paper aims to present a clear view of the mechanical properties and microstructure evolution of shape memory alloys after processing by some SPD methods, and to show that SPD methods can be a great option for developing SMAs and expanding their industrial and technological applications.},

ABSTRACT = {When using well-designed multiple-stage heavy-drawn processes, i.e., cold rolling, drawing and cluster drawing to fabricate a metallic wire or fiber in steps, cold rolling and annealing are critical steps due to their effect on the initial microstructure before the heavy-drawn process. Understanding the relationship between microstructure evolution and cold rolling followed by annealing is required for smoothly implementing the heavy-drawn process. In this work, the evolution behavior in terms of the microstructure during cold rolling followed by annealing was investigated in a novel C-2000 alloy that is a promising candidate material for the fabrication of high-performance metallicwire. The investigation encompassed parameters including the grain size, grain boundaries, recrystallization texture, and short-range ordered (SRO) structure. Results show that the grain size distribution of the cold-rolledC-2000 alloy followed by annealing at 900 °C is quite uneven. The low-angle grain boundaries induced by cold rolling are more frequently transformed into the Σ3 twin boundaries during recrystallization. At the initial stage of annealing at 900 °C after cold rolling, the contents of different texture components are significantly different, but the differences tend to decrease with the extension of the annealing time. In addition, cold rolling destroys SRO domains formed during solid solution water quenching, and the destruction of SRO affects the precipitation of the long-range ordered phase during annealing. Incoherent Σ3ic with curved grain boundaries play an important role in the recrystallization of nucleation sites in the process of static recrystallization by nucleation–growth.},

ABSTRACT = {Constitutive description of the plastic flow in metallic foams has been rarely explored in the literature. Even though the material is of great interest to researchers, its plasticity remains a topic that has a much room for exploration. With the help of the rich literature that explored the material deformation mechanism, it is possible to introduce a connection between the results of the atomistic simulations and the well-established continuum constitutive models that were developed for various loading scenarios. In this work, we perform large-scale atomistic simulations of metallic gold foams of two different sizes at a wide range of strain rates (107−109 s−1) under uniaxial compression. By utilizing the results of those simulations, as well as the results we reported in our previous works, a physical atomistic-continuum dislocations-based constitutive modeling connection is proposed to capture the compressive plastic flow in gold foams for a wide range of sizes, strain rates, temperatures, and porosities. The results reported in this work present curated datasets that can be of extreme usefulness for the data-driven AI design of metallic foams with tunable nanoscale properties. Eventually, we aim to produce an optimal physical description to improve integrated physics-based and AI-enabled design, manufacture, and validation of hierarchical architected metallic foams that deliver tailored mechanical responses and precision failure patterns at different scales.},

ABSTRACT = {The purpose of this paper was to study the kinetics of accumulation of radiation damage in the near-surface layer of a high-entropy NbTiVZr alloy upon irradiation with heavy Kr15+ ions and fluences of 1010–1015 ion/cm2. According to the data of X-ray diffraction analysis, it was found that irradiation with heavy ions lead to structural changes associated with the accumulation of deformation distortions and stresses. In this case, the nature of deformation distortions was associated with tensile distortions of the crystal lattice and swelling of the near-surface layer. An analysis of the strength properties of the irradiated samples showed that the accumulation of deformation distortions in the near-surface layer lead to a decrease in the resistance to cracking and destruction of the near-surface layer. In this case, the main changes occurred at fluences above 1013 ion/cm2, which are characterized by an excess of the threshold for overlapping defective regions that appear along the trajectory of incident ions. Tribological tests showed that an increase in defective inclusions in the structure of the near-surface layer lead to an increase in friction and a decrease in crack resistance.},

ABSTRACT = {Wear tends to shorten tool life, reduce component quality. To prevent or postpone the wear of tool steel forming tools, methods to increase wear resistance, such as increasing the material hardness, optimizing the carbide distribution and application of surface coatings, are often used. However, the formation of lubricating phases in steels leading to anti-attrition is less investigated. The friction behavior of three steels were investigated thoroughly by a tribo test with different normal loads. A Field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) along with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) were used to characterize the microstructure as well as the influence of the precipitated phases on the wear mechanisms. Results showed the friction coefficient decreased with increasing normal load, whereas the wear rate increased with increasing normal load. Compared with SKD11 and DC53 steels, the friction coefficient and wear volume of SLD-MAGIC steel were reduced by 0.1 to 0.3 and 10% to 30%, respectively. With the increase of normal load, the wear mechanism changed in order from abrasive wear, adhesive wear to oxidation wear. The more carbide contents, the rounder the carbide, the better the wear resistance of the tool steel. It can be shown that, under different normal loads, SLD-MAGIC exhibits better wear performance than SKD11 and DC53 tool steels, which is mainly due to the self-lubricating phenomenon of SLD-MAGIC steel. The self-lubricating mechanism was due to the fact that the exfoliated sulfide during wear formed a lubricating film to reduce wear.},

ABSTRACT = {Dacian civilization flourished on the actual territory of Romania during the Late Iron Age and had its peak from the first century BC to the first century AD. They had intensive relations with Hellenistic and Roman civilizations. Therefore, it is difficult to evaluate the origin of some widely spread artifacts discovered in the Dacian archeological sites. The present research is focused on two bronze artifacts (a bronze coin and a mirror fragment) found in the Alun-Piatra Rosie site and a silver coin found in the Ardeu site. Artifacts were investigated with nondestructive methods such as SEM-EDX for microstructural and elemental characterization, and the crystalline phases were investigated using XRD. Bronze coin proves to be an Istrian issue having an elemental composition of 75.0% Cu, 20.8% Sn, and 4.1% Pb, which corresponds to a structure of Cu grains mixed with Cu5.6Sn grains. The bronze mirror fragment has an elemental composition of 52.3% Cu and 47.7% Sn, which corresponds to a structure containing grains of Cu6Sn5 mixed with grains of Cu41Sn11. It has a smooth surface that was investigated with AFM microscopy, which evidences a Ra roughness of 51 nm for the patina surface and 33.7 nm for the clean metal surface, proving the high quality of the original mirror luster of the artifact. The silver coin was identified as a Radulesti–Hunedoara type meaning that it was produced in local Dacian metallurgic workshops. It has an elemental composition of 63.1% Ag, 25.3% Sn, 7.8% Cu, and small traces of P and Fe, which corresponds to a structure of Ag grains and Ag3Sn grains. Silver coins show that Dacians uses Sn as alloying element in their metallurgic workshops. Istrian bronze coin proves to be typical for Hellenistic or Roman bronze type with Sn content no more than 25% Sn. The bronze mirror fragment has an unusual composition that might be a result of al local metal charge elaboration with several Hellenistic and Roman bronze pieces as raw material and an extra Sn addition during the melting process. This material facilitates the polishing properties of the active surface that has a very low roughness even after 2000 years of ground resting and adherent oxides patina.},

ABSTRACT = {Engineering the surface orientation of face-centered cubic (fcc) metals to the close-packed {111} plane can significantly enhance their oxidation resistance. However, owing to the synergetic effect of surface energy density (γ˙) and strain energy density (ω), such close-packed surface orientation can currently only be achieved by atomic-level thin film epitaxy or monocrystallization of polycrystalline metals. In this study, we characterized the microstructures of pure copper (Cu) foil and two types of graphene-coated Cu (Gr/Cu) foils and observed a 12~14 nm thick reconstructed surface layer with the {111} orientation in the high-temperature deposited Gr/{001} Cu surface. Combining the statistical results with thermodynamic analysis, we proposed a surface melting-solidification mechanism for the reconstruction of the Cu surface from {001} orientation to {111} orientation. This process is dominated by Gr/Cu interfacial energy and is particularly promoted by high-temperature surface melting. We also validated such a mechanism by examining Cu surfaces coated by h-BN (hexagonal boron nitride) and amorphous carbon. Our findings suggest a possible strategy to enhance the surface properties of fcc metals via engineering surface crystallography.},

ABSTRACT = {The study focused on a 21.99 at.%Ti–22.49 at.%Zr–20.35 at.%Hf–17.45 at.%Mo–17.73 at.%Cr). Analytical techniques such as X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy as well as X-ray absorption spectroscopy were employed to investigate the alloy’s structure, phase transformations, and properties. The alloy in the as-cast state contained three phases, namely the body-centred cubic (A2) phase, hexagonal Laves phase (C14), and cubic Laves phase (C15). The alloy has been annealed for a long time at different temperatures. It led to the disappearance of the hexagonal Laves phase, leaving behind two primary phases, namely the cubic Laves phase (C15) and the body-centered cubic phase (A2). At 1200 °C, the A2 phase almost disappeared, resulting in a practically single-phase sample. After a high-pressure torsion (HPT) treatment, the hexagonal Laves phase disappeared entirely, while the A2 and C15 phases remained. The grain size of the A2 and C15 phases was refined after HPT and grains were elongated, and their configuration resembled a layered structure. The high hardness of the A2 and C15 + C14 phases accounted for this behavior. The lattice parameters in the A2 and C15 phases after HPT treatment approached those observed after prolonged annealing at 1000 °C, indicating that the composition of these phases after short-term high-pressure torsion at ambient temperature is equivalent to the composition of these phases after long tempering at 1000 °C. The rate of diffusion-like mass transfer during severe plastic deformation was estimated to be many orders of magnitude higher than that for conventional bulk diffusion at the HPT treatment temperature and similar to that at elevated temperatures above 1000 °C. X-ray absorption spectroscopy results obtained at K-edges of Ti, Cr, Zr, and Mo as well as at the L3-edge of Hf indicated that the local environment around metal atoms before HPT was similar to that after HPT. However, the static disorder increased after HPT, which could be attributed to an increased specific amount of metal atoms in the disordered grain boundary layers after HPT-driven grain refinement.},

ABSTRACT = {The effect of free volume on the crystallization of amorphous Fe78Si13B9 ribbons was studied using ultrasonic and thermal treatments. To maintain free volume under heating, amorphous samples were coated with a special protective Ta coating. It has been shown via X-ray diffraction that the fraction of the crystalline phase in the annealed coated amorphous ribbons is higher than in the corresponding uncoated samples. The use of ultrasonic treatment and the application of a protective coating lead to the formation of a larger proportion of the crystalline phase during annealing. Differences in crystallization kinetics are discussed under the assumption that the concentration of free volume in amorphous samples affects their crystallization, as well as the role of the Ta coating preventing the release of free volume to the surface during heat treatment.},

ABSTRACT = {Thermo-mechanical controlled processing (TMCP) is employed to obtain the required level of mechanical properties of contemporary high-strength low-alloy (HSLA) steel plates utilized for gas and oil pipeline production. The strength, deformation behavior and resistance to the formation and propagation of running fractures of the pipeline steel are mainly determined by its microstructure and crystallographic texture. These are formed as a result of austenite deformation and consequent γ→α-transformation. This present study analyses the crystallographic regularities of the structural and textural state formation in a steel plate that has been industrially produced by means of TMCP. The values of the mechanical properties that have been measured in different directions demonstrate the significance of the crystallographic texture in the deformation and failure of steel products. An electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) method and crystallographic analysis were utilized to establish the connection between the main texture components of the deformed austenite and α-phase orientations. This paper demonstrates that the crystallographic texture that is formed due to a multipath γ→α-transformation results from the α-phase nucleation on the special boundaries between grains with γ-phase orientations. The analysis of the spectra of the α-γ-interface boundary angle deviations from the Kurdjumov–Sachs (K–S), Nishiyama–Wassermann (N–W), and Greninger–Troiano (G–T) orientation relationships (ORs) allows to suggest that the observed austenite particles represent a secondary austenite (not retained) that precipitates at intercrystalline α-phase boundaries and correspond to the ORs with regard to only one adjacent crystallite.},

ABSTRACT = {A theoretical two-dimensional (2D) model is proposed that describes the effect of grain boundary (GB) segregations on the fracture toughness of nanocrystalline or ultrafine-grained alloys. It is shown that GB segregations can lead to crack curvature, providing both crack surface roughness and crack deflection near the crack tip. Within the model, the growth of cracks along GBs under the action of a tensile load is considered. The effects of brittle GB segregations on the crack surface roughness and crack deflection near the crack tip are analyzed, and the associated increase in the fracture toughness of the material is calculated. It is shown that toughening can be achieved if segregations are very brittle and occupy a moderate proportion of GBs. In particular, a sufficiently large (up to 50%) fraction of GBs containing very brittle segregations can increase the fracture toughness by 30–35%. The results of the model can be applied to thin nanocrystalline or ultrafine-grained films.},

ABSTRACT = {The study aims to investigate the influence of fraction of coarse undeformed particles on the microstructure evolution and mechanical properties of alloys processed by isothermal multidirectional forging (MDF). For this purpose, Al-Mg-Ni-Sc-Zr-based alloys with different Ni concentrations and a fraction of Al3Ni particles of solidification origin phase were subjected to MDF at 350 °C. Precipitates of the L12-structured Al3(Sc,Zr) phase retained their structure, morphology, and size after MDF and were coherent with the aluminum matrix. The Al3Ni phase particles stimulated the nucleation of recrystallized grains and contributed significantly to the formation of an ultrafine-grained structure. The uniformity of the grain structure increased, and the average grain size decreased with an increase in the fraction of Al3Ni particles. A fine-grained structure with a mean grain size of 2.4–3.4 µm was observed after MDF with a cumulative strain of 12. The results demonstrate that a bimodal particles size distribution with a volume fraction of nanoscale f~0.1% and microscale f~8% particles provided for the formation of a homogenous fine-grained structure after MDF and improved the mechanical properties.},

ABSTRACT = {The influence of additional deformation heat treatments (DHTs), implemented by two regimes: (1) annealing and small additional deformation by high-pressure torsion (HPT) at room temperature (RT) and (2) HPT at elevated temperature to 10 turns and small additional HPT at RT, has been studied on the microstructure, mechanical properties and electrical conductivity of ultrafine-grained (UFG) Al-0.53Mg-0.27Zr (wt.%) alloy structured by HPT to 10 turns at RT. As is shown, both types of additional DHT lead to a substantial increase in plasticity (2–5 times) while maintaining high electrical conductivity (~53% IACS) and strength comprising 75–85% of the value in the pre-DHT state of the UFG alloy. The possible physical reasons for the revealed changes in the physical and mechanical properties are analyzed. Comparison of the strength and plasticity changes with the microstructure evolution after DHT of both types indicates that the increase in the density of introduced grain boundary dislocations is the most probable factor providing a tremendous increase in plasticity while maintaining a high level of strength in the UFG alloy under study. An outstanding combination of high strength (370 MPa), high elongation to failure (~15%) and significant electrical conductivity (~53% IACS) was achieved for the Al-Mg-Zr alloy. This combination of properties exceeds those obtained to date for this system, as well as for a number of other commercial conductor alloys based on the Al-Zr system.},

ABSTRACT = {Titanium alloys are widely used in various industries. The most common and well-known titanium alloy is titanium alloy with aluminum and vanadium (Ti-6Al-4V). This alloy is used, for example, in the manufacture of aircraft engines. As part of the development of technologies and the emergence of the evolving requirements for materials, Ti-6Al-4V alloys with ultrafine grains less than 1 μm may become promising. This modification of the alloy has excellent strength characteristics, such as increased fatigue resistance. However, manufacturers are aware of the machinability problem of titanium alloys. To date, a sufficiently high level of understanding of this problem has already been achieved. But, there is practically no information about the machinability of ultrafine-grained alloys and their comparison, in this regard, with the usual coarse-grained version. This study presents the results of experimental studies on the influence of cutting parameters (cutting speed, V, m/min; feed rate, Fz, mm/rev) on the roughness and microstructure of the surface of Ti-6Al-4V samples with coarse-grained and ultrafine-grained structures produced via equal-channel angular pressing. It is shown that turning at a low cutting speed (V = 48 m/min) results in a better surface roughness, Ra, for the coarse-grained sample compared to its ultrafine-grained alloy counterpart. When the cutting speed is increased by 1.5 times (up to V = 72 m/min), on the contrary, the ultrafine-grained sample has a lower surface roughness, Ra, compared to the coarse-grained sample. The differences in the morphology and microstructure of the chips, depending on the microstructure type of the processed alloy, are discussed: the presence of plastic flow lines in the chip microstructure of the turned ultrafine-grained sample and the formation of shear bands, cleavages, and microcracks in the chips of the turned coarse-grained alloy.},

ABSTRACT = {Recent observations of jerky flow in high-entropy alloys (HEA) revealed a high role of self-organization of dislocations in their plasticity. The present work reports the first results of the investigation of stress fluctuations during plastic deformation of an FeCoNiTiAl alloy, examined in a wide temperature range covering both smooth and jerky flow. These fluctuations, which accompany the overall deformation behavior representing an essentially slower stress evolution controlled by the work hardening, were processed using complementary approaches comprising Fourier spectral analysis, refined composite multiscale entropy, and multifractal formalisms. The joint analysis at distinct scales testified that even a macroscopically smooth plastic flow is accompanied by nonrandom fluctuations, disclosing the self-organized dynamics of dislocations. Qualitative changes in such a fine-scale “noise” were found with varying temperature. The observed diversity is significant for understanding the relationships between different scales of plasticity of HEAs and crystal materials in general.},

ABSTRACT = {The structural, magnetocaloric, and magnetic characteristics in Heusler Ni50Mn35In10X5 (X = Ga, Fe, and Al) alloys were examined using X-ray diffraction and field-dependent magnetization measurements. All samples exhibited a mixture structure of cubic L21 and tetragonal L10 and underwent second-order magnetic transitions at TC(Al5) = 220 K, TC(Ga5) = 252 K, and TC(Fe5) = 298 K. The Ga5 alloy exhibited structural change as indicated by a thermal hysteresis that may be seen in the saturation magnetic field in the M(T) dependences. The transition at the TC point from a ferromagnetic to a paramagnetic state caused a drop in magnetization, supported by thermal hysteresis, at a low magnetic field (0.01 T). On the other hand, the Fe5 alloy presented a gradual decrease in magnetization with similar hysteresis behavior, also at a low magnetic field (0.01 T), whereas at 0.1 T of field, no features characteristic of this transition were detected. This could be due to a large difference in the metallic radius of Fe compared to that of In. Otherwise, magnetic investigations demonstrated that the replacement of In with Al may cause the structural transformation temperatures and TC to be shifted to low temperatures. The present results imply that the structural transformation temperatures and the transition itself are highly dependent on chemical composition. Furthermore, under a magnetic field change of 5 T, the maximum magnetic entropy changes of 0.6 J/kg K, 1.4 J/kg K, and 2.71 J/kg K for the Ga5, Fe5, and Al5 alloys, respectively, were determined by their TC. Refrigeration capacity values were found to be 25 J/kg, 74 J/kg, and 98 J/kg at µ0∆H = 5 T. These ribbons are viable candidates for multifunctional applications due to their cheaper cost and their physical characteristics disclosed during the magnetostructural transition, which takes place close to the room temperature.},

ABSTRACT = {This study offers valuable insights into the precipitation behavior of 13Ni maraging steels, emphasizing the role of molybdenum content in their microstructure, strengthening, and precipitate evolution. Precipitate morphology and crystallography were examined using a combination of high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and selected area electron diffraction. Strengthening mechanisms were assessed through Vickers hardness measurements. All the examined samples exhibited a lath martensite microstructure and displayed an increasing hardness over the aging time. The molybdenum content not only influenced the presence of retained austenite in the initial microstructure but also affected the type of precipitates formed during the early aging stages. Initially, Ni3Mo precipitates were formed, succeeded by the formation of more stable Fe2(Mo,Ti) Laves precipitates. The ultra-high strength of 13Ni maraging steels arises from the combination of the precipitate type and size distribution. The base composition of 13Ni maraging steels achieved a peak hardness of 798 HV1 through the precipitation of Laves Fe2(Mo,Ti) phases ranging from 3 to 14 nm in diameter.},
