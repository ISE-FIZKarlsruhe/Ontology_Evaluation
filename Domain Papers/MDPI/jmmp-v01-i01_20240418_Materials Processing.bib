ABSTRACT = {Prosumer (producing consumer)-based desktop additive manufacturing has been enabled by the recent radical reduction in 3-D printer capital costs created by the open-source release of the self-replicating rapid prototype (RepRap). To continue this success, there have been some efforts to improve reliability, which are either too expensive or lacked automation. A promising method to improve reliability is to use computer vision, although the success rates are still too low for widespread use. To overcome these challenges an open source low-cost reliable real-time optimal monitoring platform for 3-D printing from double cameras is presented here. This error detection system is implemented with low-cost web cameras and covers 360 degrees around the printed object from three different perspectives. The algorithm is developed in Python and run on a Raspberry Pi3 mini-computer to reduce costs. For 3-D printing monitoring in three different perspectives, the systems are tested with four different 3-D object geometries for normal operation and failure modes. This system is tested with two different techniques in the image pre-processing step: SIFT and RANSAC rescale and rectification, and non-rescale and rectification. The error calculations were determined from the horizontal and vertical magnitude methods of 3-D reconstruction images. The non-rescale and rectification technique successfully detects the normal printing and failure state for all models with 100% accuracy, which is better than the single camera set up only. The computation time of the non-rescale and rectification technique is two times faster than the SIFT and RANSAC rescale and rectification technique.},

ABSTRACT = {Direct Metal Deposition (DMD) is an additive manufacturing (AM) process capable of producing large components using a layer by layer deposition of molten powder. DMD is increasingly investigated due to its higher deposition rate and the possibility to produce large structural components specifically for the aerospace industry. During fabrication, a complex thermal history is experienced in different regions of the workpiece, depending on the process parameters and part geometry. The thermal history induces residual stress accumulation in the buildup, which is the main cause of distortions. In order to control the process and enhance the product quality, the understanding of the workpiece temperature is substantial. In this study, two methods to predict temperature evolution during the DMD process are introduced based on analytical and finite element methods. The objective is to compare these methods to experimental results and to provide more insights about their capabilities to predict accurately the temperature gradient, the cooling rate, and the melt pool geometry. A comparison of the computational time is also provided. Based on the results of the investigation, It appears that the analytical method provides an effective and accurate method to understand the influence of the process on the workpiece temperature.},

ABSTRACT = {Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) in diamond possesses unique properties for the realization of novel quantum devices. Among the possibilities in the solid state, a NV defect center in diamond stands out for its robustness—its quantum state can be initialized, manipulated, and measured with high fidelity at room temperature. In this paper, we illustrated the formation kinetics of NV centers in diamond and their transformation from one charge state to another. The controlled scaling of diamond NV center-based quantum registers relies on the ability to position NV defect centers with high spatial resolution. Ion irradiation technique is widely used to control the spatial distribution of NV defect centers in diamond. This is addressed in terms of energetics and kinetics in this paper. We also highlighted important factors, such as ion struggling, ion channeling, and surface charging, etc. These factors should be considered while implanting energetic nitrogen ions on diamond. Based on observations of the microscopic structure after implantation, we further discussed post-annealing treatment to heal the damage produced during the ion irradiation process. This article shows that the ion implantation technique can be used more efficiently for controlled and efficient generation of NV color centers in diamond, which will open up new possibilities in the field of novel electronics and computational engineering, including the art of quantum cryptography, data science, and spintronics.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper presents a new numerical approach for modelling the 3D printing process of fibre reinforced polymer composites by fused deposition modelling (FDM). The approach is based on the coupling between two particle methods, namely smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) and discrete element method (DEM). The coupled SPH-DEM model has distinctive advantages in dealing with the free surface flow, large deformation of fibres, and/or fibre-fibre interaction that are involved in the FDM process. A numerical feasibility study is carried out to demonstrate its capability for both short and continuous fibre reinforced polymer composites, with promising results achieved for the rheological flow and fibre orientation and deformation.},

ABSTRACT = {A major advantage of additive manufacturing (AM) technologies is the ability to print customized products, which makes these technologies well suited for the orthopedic implants industry. Another advantage is the design freedom provided by AM technologies to enhance the performance of orthopedic implants. This paper presents a state-of-the-art overview of the use of AM technologies to produce orthopedic implants from lattice structures and functionally graded materials. It discusses how both techniques can improve the implants’ performance significantly, from a mechanical and biological point of view. The characterization of lattice structures and the most recent finite element analysis models are explored. Additionally, recent case studies that use functionally graded materials in biomedical implants are surveyed. Finally, this paper reviews the challenges faced by these two applications and suggests future research directions required to improve their use in orthopedic implants.},

ABSTRACT = {The main aim of this work was to evaluate the influence and optimize the factors of the TIG-MIG/MAG hybrid welding process on the geometry of the weld bead. An experimental design using the Taguchi methodology (robust design method) was used to conduct the experiments. The experiments were carried out according to an orthogonal matrix with 27 experiments, with three replicates each, totaling 81 test specimens. The factors (MIG/MAG shielding gas type, MIG/MAG voltage, MIG/MAG wire feed, gas flow rate of TIG, electric current intensity of TIG and welding speed) were varied with three levels each. Penetration, heat-affected zone (HAZ), bead width and bead height were the response variables analyzed. The results showed that the penetration was significantly influenced by the MIG/MAG wire feed, MIG/MAG shielding gas type, MIG/MAG voltage and welding speed. The HAZ has been influenced by MIG/MAG voltage, MIG/MAG shielding gas type, welding speed and electric current intensity of TIG. All factors had effects on the width, except the MIG/MAG wire feed. The bead height was significantly influenced by the MIG/MAG wire feed and by the electric current intensity of TIG. Optimizing the process was performed, so that for each output variable, the values of the factors that should be used were indicated, and the optimization was confirmed by welding test specimens.},

ABSTRACT = {Cloud Manufacturing (CM) is the concept of using manufacturing resources in a service-oriented way over the Internet. Recent developments in Additive Manufacturing (AM) are making it possible to utilise resources ad-hoc as replacements for traditional manufacturing resources in case of spontaneous problems in the established manufacturing processes. In order to be of use in these scenarios, the AM resources must adhere to a strict principle of transparency and service composition in adherence to the Cloud Computing (CC) paradigm. With this review, we provide an overview of CM, AM and relevant domains as well as presenting the historical development of scientific research in these fields, from 2002 to 2016. Part of this work is also a meta-review on the domain to further detail its development and structure.},

ABSTRACT = {In the present study, the mesostructure of a fused deposition modeling (FDM) processed part is considered for the investigation of its mechanical behavior. The layers of FDM printed part behave as a unidirectional fiber reinforced laminae, which are treated as an orthotropic material. The finite element (FE) procedure to find elastic moduli of a layer of the FDM processed part is presented. The mesostructure of the part that would be obtained from the process is replicated in FE models in order to find stiffness matrix of a layer. Two distinctive architectures of mesostructure are considered in the study to predict the mechanical behavior of the parts. Also, influences of layer thickness, road shape and air gap on the elastic properties of a material are investigated. Further, the parts fabricated with FDM process are treated as laminate structures. From the numerical results, it is seen that the elastic moduli are governed by mesostructures. Our laminate results are validated with experimental to demonstrate the use of classical laminate theory (CLT) for FDM parts. The elastic moduli (E1, E2, G12, ν12) of a layer used in the analysis are calculated from FE simulations. This study establishes relationship between mesostructure and macro mechanical properties of the part.},

ABSTRACT = {The laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) technology was adapted for use with non-spherical low-cost water-atomized iron powders. A simplified numerical and experimental modeling approach was applied to determine—in a first approximation—the operation window for the selected powder in terms of laser power, scanning speed, hatching space, and layer thickness. The operation window, delimited by a build rate ranging from 4 to 25 cm3/h, and a volumetric energy density ranging from 50 to 190 J/mm3, was subsequently optimized to improve the density, the mechanical properties, and the surface roughness of the manufactured specimens. Standard L-PBF-built specimens were subjected to microstructural (porosity, grain size) and metrological (accuracy, shrinkage, minimum wall thickness, surface roughness) analyses and mechanical testing (three-point bending and tensile tests). The results of the microstructural, metrological and mechanical characterizations of the L-PBF-built specimens subjected to stress relieve annealing and hot isostatic pressing were then compared with those obtained with conventional pressing-sintering technology. Finally, by using an energy density of 70 J/mm3 and a build rate of 9 cm3/h, it was possible to manufacture 99.8%-dense specimens with an ultimate strength of 330 MPa and an elongation to failure of 30%, despite the relatively poor circularity of the powder used.},

ABSTRACT = {One of the most essential components of the fused deposition modeling (FDM) additive manufacturing (AM) process is the build plate, the surface upon which the part is constructed. These are typically made from aluminum or glass, but there are clear disadvantages to both and restrictions on which materials can be processed on them successfully. This study examined the suitability of heated aluminum-polycarbonate (AL-PC) composite print beds for FDM, looking particularly at the mechanical properties, thermal behavior, deformation behavior, bonding strength with deposited material, printing quality, and range of material usability. Theoretical examination and physical experiments were performed for each of these areas; the results were compared to similar experiments done using heated aluminum and aluminum-glass print beds. Ten distinct materials (ABS, PLA, PET, HIPS, PC, TPU, PVA, nylon, metal PLA, and carbon-fiber PLA) were tested for printing performance. The use of a heated AL-PC print bed was found to be a practical option for most of the materials, particularly ABS and TPU, which are often challenging to process using traditional print bed types. Generally, the results were found to be equivalent to or superior to tempered glass and superior to standard aluminum build plates in terms of printing capability.},

ABSTRACT = {In this work, the microstructure, texture, phases, and microhardness of 45° printed (with respect to the build direction) homogenized, and hot isostatically pressed (HIP) cylindrical IN718 specimens are investigated. Phase morphology, grain size, microhardness, and crystallographic texture at the bottom of each specimen differ from those of the top due to changes in cooling rate. High cooling rates during the printing process generated a columnar grain structure parallel to the building direction in the as-printed condition with a texture transition from (001) orientation at the bottom of the specimen to (111) orientation towards the specimen top based on EBSD analysis. A mixed columnar and equiaxed grain structure associated with about a 15% reduction in texture is achieved after homogenization treatment. HIP treatment caused significant grain coarsening, and engendered equiaxed grains with an average diameter of 154.8 µm. These treatments promoted the growth of δ-phase (Ni3Nb) and MC-type brittle (Ti, Nb)C carbides at grain boundaries. Laves phase (Fe2Nb) was also observed in the as-printed and homogenized specimens. Ostwald ripening of (Ti, Nb)C carbides caused excessive grain growth at the bottom of the HIPed IN718 specimens, while smaller grains were observed at their top. Microhardness in the as-fabricated specimens was 236.9 HV and increased in the homogenized specimens by 19.3% to 282.6 HV due to more even distribution of secondary precipitates, and the nucleation of smaller grains. A 36.1% reduction in microhardness to 180.5 HV was found in the HIPed condition due to   γ ″ phase dissolution and differences in grain morphology.},

ABSTRACT = {This experimental study focuses on various cooling strategies and lubrication-assisted cooling strategies to improve machining performance in the turning process of AISI 4140 steel. Liquid nitrogen (LN2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) were used as cryogenic coolants, and their performances were compared with respect to progression of tool wear. Minimum quantity lubrication (MQL) was also used with carbon dioxide. Progression of wear, including flank and nose, are the main outputs examined during experimental study. This study illustrates that carbon dioxide-assisted cryogenic machining alone and with minimum quantity lubrication does not contribute to decreasing the progression of wear within selected cutting conditions. This study also showed that carbon dioxide-assisted cryogenic machining helps to increase chip breakability. Liquid nitrogen-assisted cryogenic machining results in a reduction of tool wear, including flank and nose wear, in the machining process of AISI 4140 steel material. It was also observed that in the machining process of this material at a cutting speed of 80 m/min, built-up edges occurred in both cryogenic cooling conditions. Additionally, chip flow damage occurs in particularly dry machining.},

ABSTRACT = {Among additive manufacturing (AM) techniques, Selective Laser Melting (SLM) is widely used to fabricate metal components, including biocompatible bone implants made of 316L stainless steel. However, an issue with the components manufactured using this technique is the surface quality, which is generally beyond the acceptable range. Thus, hybrid manufacturing, including AM and finish machining processes, are being developed and implemented in the industry. Machining processes, particularly finish machining, are needed to improve surface quality of additively manufactured components and performance. This study focuses on the finish machining process of additively manufactured 316L stainless steel parts. Finish machining tests were carried out under dry conditions for various cutting speeds and feed rates. The experimental study reveals that finish machining resulted in up to 88% lower surface roughness of SLMed 316L stainless steel; it also had a substantial effect on microstructure and microhardness of the additively manufactured components by creating smaller grains and strain-hardened layer on the surface and subsurface of the SLMed part. The finish machining process also significantly decreased the density of porosity on the surface and subsurface, compared to an as-built sample. The created strain harden layer with less porosity is expected to increases wear and fatigue resistance of these parts.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper presents an original method of predicting temperature distribution in orthogonal machining based on a constitutive model of various materials and the mechanics of their cutting process. Currently, temperature distribution is commonly investigated using arduous experiments, computationally inefficient numerical analyses, and complex analytical models. In the method proposed herein, the average temperatures at the primary shear zone (PSZ) and the secondary shear zone (SSZ) were determined for various materials, based on a constitutive model and a chip-formation model using measurements of cutting force and chip thickness. The temperatures were determined when differences between predicted shear stresses using the Johnson–Cook constitutive model (J–C model) and those using a chip-formation model were minimal. J–C model constants from split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) tests were adopted from the literature. Cutting conditions, experimental cutting force, and chip thickness were used to predict the shear stresses. The temperature predictions were compared to documented results in the literature for AISI 1045 steel and Al 6082-T6 aluminum in multiple tests in an effort to validate this methodology. Good agreement was observed for the tests with each material. Thanks to the reliable and easily measurable cutting forces and chip thicknesses, and the simple forms of the employed models, the presented methodology has less experimental complexity, less mathematical complexity, and high computational efficiency.},

ABSTRACT = {The additive manufacturing (AM) of aluminum alloys promises to considerably enhance the performance of lightweight critical parts in various industrial applications. AlSi10Mg is one of the compatible Al alloys used in the selective laser melting of lightweight components. However, the surface defects obtained from the as-built parts affect their mechanical properties, and thus represent an obstacle to using them as final products. This study aims to improve the surface characteristics of the as-built AlSi10Mg parts using shot peening (SP). To achieve this goal, different SP intensities were applied to various surface textures of the as-built samples. The SP results showed a significant improvement in the as-built surface topography and a higher value of effective depth using 22.9 A intensity and Gp165 glass beads. The area near the shot-peened surface showed a significant microstructure refinement to a specific depth due to the dynamic precipitation of nanoscale Si particles. Surface hardening was also detected and high compressive residual stresses were generated due to severe plastic deformation. The surface characteristics obtained after SP could result in a significant improvement in the mechanical properties and fatigue strength, and thus promise performance enhancement for critical parts in various industrial applications.},

ABSTRACT = {Difficult-to-cut materials have been widely employed in many engineering applications, including automotive and aeronautical designs because of their effective properties. However, other characteristics; for example, high hardness and low thermal conductivity has negatively affected the induced surface quality and tool life, and consequently the overall machinability of such materials. Inconel 718, is widely used in many industries including aerospace; however, the high temperature generated during machining is negatively affecting its machinability. Flood cooling is a commonly used remedy to improve machinability problems; however, government regulation has called for further alternatives to reduce the environmental and health impacts of flood cooling. This work aimed to investigate the influence of dispersed multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and aluminum oxide (Al2O3) gamma nanoparticles, on enhancing the minimum quantity lubrication (MQL) technique cooling and lubrication capabilities during turning of Inconel 718. Machining tests were conducted, the generated surfaces were examined, and the energy consumption data were recorded. The study was conducted under different design variables including cutting speed, percentage of added nano-additives (wt.%), and feed velocity. The study revealed that the nano-fluids usage, generally improved the machining performance when cutting Inconel 718. In addition, it was shown that the nanotubes additives provided better improvements than Al2O3 nanoparticles.},

ABSTRACT = {A physics-based analytical model is proposed in order to predict the temperature profile during metal additive manufacturing (AM) processes, by considering the effects of temperature history in each layer, temperature-sensitivity of material properties and latent heat. The moving heat source analysis is used in order to predict the temperature distribution inside a semi-infinite solid material. The laser thermal energy deposited into a control volume is absorbed by the material thermodynamic latent heat and conducted through the contacting solid boundaries. The analytical model takes in to account the typical multi-layer aspect of additive manufacturing processes for the first time. The modeling of the problem involving multiple layers is of great importance because the thermal interactions of successive layers affect the temperature gradients, which govern the heat transfer and thermal stress development mechanisms. The temperature profile is calculated for isotropic and homogeneous material. The proposed model can be used to predict the temperature in laser-based metal additive manufacturing configurations of either direct metal deposition or selective laser melting. A numerical analysis is also conducted to simulate the temperature profile in metal AM. These two models are compared with experimental results. The proposed model also well captured the melt pool geometry as it is compared to experimental values. In order to emphasize the importance of solving the problem considering multiple layers, the peak temperature considering the layer addition and peak temperature not considering the layer addition are compared. The results show that considering the layer addition aspect of metal additive manufacturing can help to better predict the surface temperature and melt pool geometry. An analysis is conducted to show the importance of considering the temperature sensitivity of material properties in predicting temperature. A comparison of the computational time is also provided for analytical and numerical modeling. Based on the obtained results, it appears that the proposed analytical method provides an effective and accurate method to predict the temperature in metal AM.},

ABSTRACT = {Additive manufacturing (AM) has developed rapidly since its inception in the 1980s. AM is perceived as an environmentally friendly and sustainable technology and has already gained a lot of attention globally. The potential freedom of design offered by AM is, however, often limited when printing complex geometries due to an inability to support the stresses inherent within the manufacturing process. Additional support structures are often needed, which leads to material, time and energy waste. Research in support structures is, therefore, of great importance for the future and further improvement of additive manufacturing. This paper aims to review the varied research that has been performed in the area of support structures. Fifty-seven publications regarding support structure optimization are selected and categorized into six groups for discussion. A framework is established in which future research into support structures can be pursued and standardized. By providing a comprehensive review and discussion on support structures, AM can be further improved and developed in terms of support waste in the future, thus, making AM a more sustainable technology.},

ABSTRACT = {One of the challenges of additive manufacturing (AM) technology is the inability to generate repeatable microstructure and mechanical properties in different orientations. In this work, the effect of build orientation on the microstructure and mechanical properties of Ti–6Al–4V specimens manufactured by selective laser melting (SLM) was studied. The samples built in the Z orientation showed weaker tensile strength compared to the samples built in X, and Y orientations. Samples built in X and Y orientations exhibited brittle fracture features in areas close to the substrate and ductile fracture features in the area farther from the substrate. Defects including pores, cracks, and unmelted/partially-melted powder particles contributed to lower tensile and fracture toughness properties in different orientations.},

ABSTRACT = {The new generation of ICT solutions applied to the monitoring, adaptation, simulation and optimisation of factories are key enabling technologies for a new level of manufacturing capability and adaptability in the context of Industry 4.0. Given the advances in sensor technologies, factories, as well as machine tools can now be sensorised, and the vast amount of data generated can be exploited by intelligent information processing techniques such as machine learning. This paper presents an online tool wear classification system built in terms of a monitoring infrastructure, dedicated to perform dry milling on steel while capturing force signals, and a computing architecture, assembled for the assessment of the flank wear based on deep learning. In particular, this approach demonstrates that a big data analytics method for classification applied to large volumes of continuously-acquired force signals generated at high speed during milling responds sufficiently well when used as an indicator of the different stages of tool wear. This research presents the design, development and deployment of the system components and an overall evaluation that involves machining experiments, data collection, training and validation, which, as a whole, has shown an accuracy of 78%.},

ABSTRACT = {This study shows the effect of hot isostatic pressing (HIP) on the porosity and the microstructure, as well as the corresponding fatigue strength of selectively-laser-melted (SLM) AlSi10Mg structures. To eliminate the influence of the as-built surface, all specimens are machined and exhibit a polished surface. To highlight the effect of the HIP treatment, the HIP specimens are compared to a test series without any post-treatment. The fatigue characteristic is evaluated by tension-compression high cycle fatigue tests under a load stress ratio of R = −1. The influence of HIP on the microstructural characteristics is investigated by utilizing scanning electron microscopy of micrographs of selected samples. In order to study the failure mechanism and the fatigue crack origin, a fracture surface analysis is carried out. It is found that, due to the HIP process and subsequent annealing, there is a beneficial effect on the microstructure regarding the fatigue crack propagation, such as Fe-rich precipitates and silicon agglomerations. This leads, combined with a significant reduction of global porosity and a decrease of micro pore sizes, to an improved fatigue resistance for the HIPed condition compared to the other test series within this study.},

ABSTRACT = {A simplified analytical model of the laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) process was used to develop a novel density prediction approach that can be adapted for any given powder feedstock and LPBF system. First, calibration coupons were built using IN625, Ti64 and Fe powders and a specific LPBF system. These coupons were manufactured using the predetermined ranges of laser power, scanning speed, hatching space, and layer thickness, and their densities were measured using conventional material characterization techniques. Next, a simplified melt pool model was used to calculate the melt pool dimensions for the selected sets of printing parameters. Both sets of data were then combined to predict the density of printed parts. This approach was additionally validated using the literature data on AlSi10Mg and 316L alloys, thus demonstrating that it can reliably be used to optimize the laser powder bed metal fusion process.},

ABSTRACT = {With the dramatic increment of complexity, more microfluidic devices require 3D structures, such as multi-depth and -layer channels. The traditional multi-step photolithography is time-consuming and labor-intensive and also requires precise alignment during the fabrication of microfluidic devices. Here, we present an inexpensive, single-step, and rapid fabrication method for multi-depth microfluidic devices using a high-resolution liquid crystal display (LCD) stereolithographic (SLA) three-dimensional (3D) printing system. With the pixel size down to 47.25 μm, the feature resolutions in the horizontal and vertical directions are 150 μm and 50 μm, respectively. The multi-depth molds were successfully printed at the same time and the multi-depth features were transferred properly to the polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) having multi-depth channels via soft lithography. A flow-focusing droplet generator with a multi-depth channel was fabricated using the presented 3D printing method. Experimental results show that the multi-depth channel could manipulate the morphology and size of droplets, which is desired for many engineering applications. Taken together, LCD SLA 3D printing is an excellent alternative method to the multi-step photolithography for the fabrication of multi-depth microfluidic devices. Taking the advantages of its controllability, cost-effectiveness, and acceptable resolution, LCD SLA 3D printing can have a great potential to fabricate 3D microfluidic devices.},

ABSTRACT = {A wide variety of coating methods and materials are available for different coating applications with a common purpose of protecting a part or structure exposed to mechanical or chemical damage. A benefit of this protective function is to decrease manufacturing cost since fabrication of new parts is not needed. Available coating materials include hard and stiff metallic alloys, ceramics, bio-glasses, polymers, and engineered plastic materials, giving designers a variety freedom of choices for durable protection. To date, numerous processes such as physical/chemical vapor deposition, micro-arc oxidation, sol–gel, thermal spraying, and electrodeposition processes have been introduced and investigated. Although each of these processes provides advantages, there are always drawbacks limiting their application. However, there are many solutions to overcome deficiencies of coating techniques by using the benefits of each process in a multi-method coating. In this article, these coating methods are categorized, and compared. By developing more advanced coating techniques and materials it is possible to enhance the qualities of protection in the future.},

ABSTRACT = {The purpose of the study was to propose a strategy to assess the potential reduction of the production cost during wire+arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) based on the combination of wire feed speed (related to deposition rate) and travel speed (related to deposition time). A series of experiments, using a multilayer-non-oscillated single pass wall made of an Al-Mg alloy, was conducted. The quality of the wall was assessed through the lateral surface waviness and top layer undulation. The concepts of Surface Waviness and Buy-to-Apply indices were introduced. Initially, the range of travel speed (TS) that provided layers with acceptable quality was determined for a given wire feed speed (WFS), corresponding to a constant current. Then, the effect of the increase of production capacity of the process (though current raising, yet maintaining the ratio WFS/TS constant) on the wall quality for a given condition within the TS range was assessed. The results showed that the useful range of TS prevents too rough a waving surface below the lower limit and top surface undulation over the higher limit. However, inside the range, there is little quality variation for the case under study. Finally, simulations of deposition time were developed to demonstrate the weight of the TS on the final deposition time and wall quality as a function of a target wall width. This respective weight showed the existence of a complex and unpredictable, yet determined, power of a combination of TS, target wall geometry, and dead time between subsequent layers. It was verified to be possible to find optimized TS as a function of different target geometries.},

ABSTRACT = {T-welded joints are commonly seen in various industrial assemblies. An effort is made to check the applicability of friction stir welding for producing T-joints made of AA6063-T6 using a developed fixture. Quality T-joints were produced free from any surface defects. The effects of three parameters, such as the speed of rotation of the tool, axial force, and travel speed were analyzed. Correspondingly, mechanical characteristics such as tensile strength, hardness in three zones (thermal heat affected zone, heat affected zone, and nugget zone) and temperature distribution were measured. The full factorial analysis was performed with various combinations of parameters generated using factorial design and responses. Evident changes in the strength, hardness, and temperature profile were noticed for each combination of parameters. The three main parameters were significant in every response with p-values less than 0.05, indicating their importance in the friction stir welding process. Mathematical models developed for investigated responses were satisfactory with high R-sq and least percentage error.},

ABSTRACT = {Machining processes, including turning, are a critical capability for discrete part production. One limitation to high material removal rates and reduced cost in these processes is chatter, or unstable spindle speed-chip width combinations that exhibit a self-excited vibration. In this paper, an artificial neural network (ANN)—a data learning model—is applied to model turning stability. The novel approach is to use a physics-based process model—the analytical stability limit—to generate a (synthetic) data set that trains the ANN. This enables the process physics to be combined with data learning in a hybrid approach. As anticipated, it is observed that the number and distribution of training points influences the ability of the ANN model to capture the smaller, more closely spaced lobes that occur at lower spindle speeds. Overall, the ANN is successful (>90% accuracy) at predicting the stability behavior after appropriate training.},

ABSTRACT = {The quality and reliability in additive manufacturing is an emerging area. To ensure process quality and reliability, the influence of all process parameters and conditions needs to be understood. The product quality and reliability characteristics, i.e., dimensional accuracy, precision, repeatability, and reproducibility are mostly affected by inherent and systematic manufacturing process variations. This paper presents research on dimensional quality and distortion analysis of AlSi10Mg thin-walled parts developed by a selective laser melting technique. The input process parameters were fixed, and the impact of inherent process variation on dimensional accuracy and precision was studied. The process stability and variability were examined under repeatability and reproducibility conditions. The sample length (horizontal dimension) results revealed a 0.05 mm maximum dimensional error, 0.0197 mm repeatability, and 0.0169 mm reproducibility. Similarly, in sample height (vertical dimension) results, 0.258 mm maximum dimensional error, 0.0237 mm repeatability, and 0.0863 mm reproducibility were observed. The effect of varying design thickness on thickness accuracy was analyzed, and regression analysis performed. The maximum 0.038 mm error and 0.018 mm standard deviation was observed for the 1 mm thickness sample, which significantly decreased for sample thickness ≥2 mm. The % error decreased exponentially with increasing sample thickness. The distortion analysis was performed to explore the effect of sample thickness on part distortion. The 0.5 mm thickness sample shows a very high distortion comparatively, and it is reduced significantly for >0.5 mm thickness samples. The study is further extended to examine the effect of solution heat treatment and artificial aging on the accuracy, precision, and distortion; however, it did not improve the results. Conclusively, the sample dimensions, i.e., length and height, have shown fluctuations due to inherent process characteristics under repeatability and reproducibility conditions. The ANOVA results revealed that sample length means are not statistically significantly different, whereas sample height means are significantly different. The horizontal dimensions in the xy-plane have better accuracy and precision compared to the vertical dimension in the z-axis. The accuracy and precision increased, whereas part distortion decreased with increasing thickness.},

ABSTRACT = {The implementation of sustainable machining process can be accomplished by different strategies including process optimization and selection of the proper lubrication techniques and cutting conditions. The present study is carried out from the perspective of a sustainability assessment of turning Ti-6Al-4V by employing minimum quantity lubrication (MQL) and MQL-nanofluid with consideration of the surface quality, tool wear, and power consumption. A sustainability assessment algorithm was used to assess the cutting processes of Ti-6Al-4V alloy under a minimum quantity of lubrication–nanofluid to estimate the levels of sustainable design variables. The assessment included the sustainable indicators as well as the machining responses in a single integrated model. The sustainable aspects included in this study were; environmental impact, management of waste, and safety and health issues of operators. The novelty here lies in employing a comprehensive sustainability assessment model to discuss and understand the machining process with MQL-nanofluid, by not only considering the machining quality characteristics, but also taking into account different sustainability indicators. In order to validate the effectiveness of the sustainability results, a comparison between the optimal and predicted responses was conducted and a good agreement was noticed. It should be stated that MQL-nanofluid showed better results compared to the cutting tests conducted under using classical MQL.},

ABSTRACT = {Fused deposition modeling (FDM) is an additive manufacturing (AM) process that is often used to fabricate geometrically complex shaped prototypes and parts. It is gaining popularity as it reduces cycle time for product development without the need for expensive tools. However, the commercialization of FDM technology in various industrial applications is currently limited due to several shortcomings, such as insufficient mechanical properties, poor surface quality, and low dimensional accuracy. The qualities of FDM-produced products are affected by various process parameters, for example, layer thickness, build orientation, raster width, or print speed. The setting of process parameters and their range depends on the section of FDM machines. Filament materials, nozzle dimensions, and the type of machine determine the range of various parameters. The optimum setting of parameters is deemed to improve the qualities of three-dimensional (3D) printed parts and may reduce post-production work. This paper intensively reviews state-of-the-art literature on the influence of parameters on part qualities and the existing work on process parameter optimization. Additionally, the shortcomings of existing works are identified, challenges and opportunities to work in this field are evaluated, and directions for future research in this field are suggested.},

ABSTRACT = {Binder jet additive manufacturing enables the production of complex components for numerous applications. Binder jetting is the only powder bed additive manufacturing process that is not fusion-based, thus manufactured parts have no residual stresses as opposed to laser-based additive manufacturing processes. Binder jet technology can be adopted for the production of various small and large metallic parts for specific applications, including in the biomedical and energy sectors, at a lower cost and shorter lead time. One of the most well-known types of stainless steels for various industries is 316L, which has been extensively manufactured using binder jet technology. Binder jet manufactured 316L parts have obtained near full density and, in some cases, similar mechanical properties compared to conventionally manufactured parts. This article introduces methods, principles, and applications of binder jetting of SS 316L. Details of binder jetting processes, including powder characteristics (shape and size), binder properties (binder chemistry and droplet formation mechanism), printing process parameters (such as layer thickness, binder saturation, drying time), and post-processing sintering mechanism and densification processes, are carefully reviewed. Furthermore, critical factors in the selection of feedstock, printing parameters, sintering temperature, time, atmosphere, and heating rate of 316L binder jet manufactured parts are highlighted and summarized. Finally, the above-mentioned processing parameters are correlated with final density and mechanical properties of 316L components to establish a guideline on feedstock selection and process parameters optimization to achieve desired density, structure and properties for various applications.},

ABSTRACT = {Fused filament fabrication (FFF) is a cost-effective additive manufacturing method that makes use of thermoplastics to produce customised products. However, there are several limitations associated with FFF that are adversely affecting its growth including variety of materials, rough surface finish and poor mechanical properties. This has resulted in the development of metal-infused thermoplastics that can provide better properties. Furthermore, FFF-printed parts can be subjected to post-processes to improve their surface finish and mechanical properties. This work takes into consideration two commonly used polymeric materials, i.e., ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene) and PLA (polylactic acid) and compares the results with two metal-infused thermoplastics i.e., copper-enhanced PLA and aluminium-enhanced ASA (acrylonitrile styrene acrylate). The four different materials were subjected to a post-process called annealing to enhance their mechanical properties. The effect of annealing on these four materials was investigated through dimensional analysis, ultrasonic testing, tensile testing, microstructural analysis and hardness testing. The results showed that annealing affects the materials differently. However, a correlation among ultrasonic testing, tensile testing and microstructural analysis was observed for all the materials based on their crystallinity. It was found that the semi-crystalline materials (i.e., PLA and copper enhanced PLA) showed a considerable increase in tensile strength post-annealing. However, the amorphous materials (ABS and aluminium-enhanced ASA) showed a comparatively lower increase in tensile strength, demonstrating that they were less receptive to annealing. These results were supported by higher transmission times and a high percentage of voids in the amorphous materials. The highest hardness values were observed for the ASA material and the lowest for the ABS material. This work provides a good comparison for the metal-infused thermoplastics and their applicability with the commonly used PLA and ABS materials.},

ABSTRACT = {This article provides a comprehensive review of the advancements made in the diffusion bonding of titanium and its alloys to other advanced materials such as aluminium, stainless steel, and magnesium. This combination of advanced alloys has received considerable attention in different industries, including aerospace, petrochemical, and nuclear applications due to high specific strength, lightweight, corrosion resistance, and moderate to high mechanical properties. The mechanisms of bond formation are discussed based on the type of microstructures formed and the mechanical properties achieved. The scientific literature identifies various methods/processes for controlling the volume of intermetallic compounds formed within the joint regions, as well as ways of maximising the strength of the weld/joints. This paper discusses the relationship between weld/bond properties and bonding parameters such as time, temperature, surface roughness, pressures, interlayer composition, and thickness. The scientific literature also shows that the bonding mechanisms and microstructural evolution of the bond zone can be significantly affected by suitable optimization of the bonding parameters. Additionally, this is a method of maximising bond strength.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper deals with the development and comparison of prediction models established using response surface methodology (RSM) and artificial neural network (ANN) for a wire electrical discharge machining (WEDM) process. The WEDM experiments were designed using central composite design (CCD) for machining of Inconel 718 superalloy. During experimentation, the pulse-on-time (TON), pulse-off-time (TOFF), servo-voltage (SV), peak current (IP), and wire tension (WT) were chosen as control factors, whereas, the kerf width (Kf), surface roughness (Ra), and materials removal rate (MRR) were selected as performance attributes. The analysis of variance tests was performed to identify the control factors that significantly affect the performance attributes. The double hidden layer ANN model was developed using a back-propagation ANN algorithm, trained by the experimental results. The prediction accuracy of the established ANN model was found to be superior to the RSM model. Finally, the Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA- II) was implemented to determine the optimum WEDM conditions from multiple objectives.},

The design of experiments method (DOE) was used and nine models of the same size were fabricated in a low-cost 3D printer using polylactic acid (PLA) material. Two limited studied parameters were considered (extraction temperature and wall thickness), each one having three levels. External X and Y dimensions were measured using a micrometer, as well as four surface roughness parameters (Ra, Rz, Rt, Rsm) with a surface tester. Two optimization techniques (the Taguchi approach and Grey relational analysis) were utilized along with statistical analysis to examine how the temperature and wall thickness affect the dimensional accuracy and the surface quality of the parts. The results showed that high extraction temperature and median wall thickness values optimize both dimensional accuracy and surface roughness, while temperature is the most important factor.},

ABSTRACT = {Distributed digital manufacturing offers a solution to medical supply and technology shortages during pandemics. To prepare for the next pandemic, this study reviews the state-of-the-art of open hardware designs needed in a COVID-19-like pandemic. It evaluates the readiness of the top twenty technologies requested by the Government of India. The results show that the majority of the actual medical products have some open source development, however, only 15% of the supporting technologies required to produce them are freely available. The results show there is still considerable research needed to provide open source paths for the development of all the medical hardware needed during pandemics. Five core areas of future research are discussed, which include (i) technical development of a wide-range of open source solutions for all medical supplies and devices, (ii) policies that protect the productivity of laboratories, makerspaces, and fabrication facilities during a pandemic, as well as (iii) streamlining the regulatory process, (iv) developing Good-Samaritan laws to protect makers and designers of open medical hardware, as well as to compel those with knowledge that will save lives to share it, and (v) requiring all citizen-funded research to be released with free and open source licenses.},

ABSTRACT = {By additive manufacturing technologies, an object is produced deposing material layer by layer. The piece grows along the build direction, which is one of the main manufacturing parameters of Additive Manufacturing (AM) technologies to be set-up. This process parameter affects the cost, quality, and other important properties of the manufactured object. In this paper, the Objective Functions (OFs), presented in the literature for the search of the optimal build direction, are considered and reviewed. The following OFs are discussed: part quality, surface quality, support structure, build time, manufacturing cost, and mechanical properties. All of them are distinguished factors that are affected by build direction. In the first part of the paper, a collection of the most significant published methods for the estimation of the factors that most influence the build direction is presented. In the second part, a summary of the optimization techniques adopted from the reviewed papers is presented. Finally, the advantages and disadvantages are briefly discussed and some possible new fields of exploration are proposed.},

ABSTRACT = {Due to their flexibility, low cost and large working volume, 6-axis articulated industrial robots are increasingly being used for drilling, trimming and machining operations, especially in aerospace manufacturing. However, producing high quality components has demonstrated to be difficult, as a result of the inherent problems of robots, including low structural stiffness and low positional accuracy. These limit robotic machining to non-critical components and parts with low accuracy and surface finish requirements. Studies have been carried out to improve robotic machine capability, specifically positioning accuracy and vibration reduction. This study includes the description of the hardware, software and methodologies developed to compensate robot path errors in real time using a single three-degrees-of-freedom (DOF) laser tracker, as well as the experimental results with and without compensation. Performance tests conducted include ballbar dynamic path accuracy test, a series of drilling case studies and a machining test. The results demonstrate major improvements in path accuracy, hole position accuracy and hole quality, as well as increases in accuracy of a machined aluminum part.},

ABSTRACT = {The design and development of composite structures requires precise and robust manufacturing processes. Composite materials such as fiber reinforced thermoplastics (FRTP) provide a good balance between manufacturing time, mechanical performance and weight. In this contribution, we investigate the process combination of thermoforming FRTP sheets (organo sheets) and injection overmolding of short FRTP for automotive structures. The limiting factor in those structures is the bond strength between the organo sheet and the overmolded thermoplastic. Within this process chain, even small deviations of the process settings (e.g., temperature) can lead to significant defects in the structure. A cyber physical production system based framework for a digital twin combining simulation and machine learning is presented. Based on parametric Finite-Element-Method (FEM) studies, training data for machine learning methods are generated and a FEM surrogate is developed. A comparison of different data-driven methods yields information on the estimation accuracy of task-specific data-driven methods. Finally, in accordance with experimental cross tension tests, the investigated FEM surrogate model is able to predict the interface bond strength quality in dependence of the process settings. The visualization into different quality domains qualifies the presented approach as decision support.},

ABSTRACT = {The work is devoted to the research of the changes that occur in the subsurface layer of the workpiece during electrical discharge machining of conductive nanocomposite based on alumina with the use of a brass tool. The nanocomposite of Al2O3 + 30% of TiC was electroerosively machined in a water and hydrocarbon oil. The process of electrical discharge machining is accompanied by oscillations that were registered by diagnostic means. The obtained surface of the samples was researched by the means of scanning electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The observed surface and subsurface changes provide grounding for the conclusions on the nature of processes and reactions that occur between two electrodes and nanomodification of the obtained surfaces that can be an advantage for a series of applications.},

ABSTRACT = {This review focuses on the current state of the art in liquid metal additive manufacturing (AM), an emerging and growing family of related printing technologies used to fabricate near-net shape or fully free-standing metal objects. The various printing modes and droplet generation techniques as applied to liquid metals are discussed. Two different printing modes, continuous and drop-on-demand (DOD), exist for liquid metal printing and are based on commercial inkjet printing technology. Several techniques are in various stages of development from laboratory testing, prototyping, to full commercialization. Printing techniques include metal droplet generation by piezoelectric actuation or impact-driven, electrostatic, pneumatic, electrohydrodynamic (EHD), magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) ejection, or droplet generation by application of a high-power laser. The impetus for development of liquid metal printing was the precise, and often small scale, jetting of solder alloys for microelectronics applications. The fabrication of higher-melting-point metals and alloys and the printing of free-standing metal objects has provided further motivation for the research and development of liquid metal printing.},

ABSTRACT = {Additive manufacturing (AM) technology has rapidly evolved with research advances related to AM processes, materials, and designs. The advantages of AM over conventional techniques include an augmented capability to produce parts with complex geometries, operational flexibility, and reduced production time. However, AM processes also face critical issues, such as poor surface quality and inadequate mechanical properties. Therefore, several post-processing technologies are applied to improve the surface quality of the additively manufactured parts. This work aims to document post-processing technologies and their applications concerning different AM processes. Various types of post-process treatments are reviewed and their integrations with AM process are discussed.},

ABSTRACT = {Fused filament fabrication (FFF) is one of the most popular additive manufacturing (AM) processes that utilize thermoplastic polymers to produce three-dimensional (3D) geometry products. The FFF filament materials have a significant role in determining the properties of the final part produced, such as mechanical properties, thermal conductivity, and electrical conductivity. This article intensively reviews the state-of-the-art materials for FFF filaments. To date, there are many different types of FFF filament materials that have been developed. The filament materials range from pure thermoplastics to composites, bioplastics, and composites of bioplastics. Different types of reinforcements such as particles, fibers, and nanoparticles are incorporated into the composite filaments to improve the FFF build part properties. The performance, limitations, and opportunities of a specific type of FFF filament will be discussed. Additionally, the challenges and requirements for filament production from different materials will be evaluated. In addition, to provide a concise review of fundamental knowledge about the FFF filament, this article will also highlight potential research directions to stimulate future filament development. Finally, the importance and scopes of using bioplastics and their composites for developing eco-friendly filaments will be introduced.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper presents a brief introduction to competition-driven digital transformation in the machining sector. On this basis, the creation of a digital twin for machining processes is approached firstly using a basic digital twin structure. The latter is sub-grouped into information and data models, specific calculation and process models, all seen from an application-oriented perspective. Moreover, digital shadow and digital twin are embedded in this framework, being discussed in the context of a state-of-the-art literature review. The main part of this paper addresses models for machine and path inaccuracies, material removal and tool engagement, cutting force, process stability, thermal behavior, workpiece and surface properties. Furthermore, these models are superimposed towards an integral digital twin. In addition, the overall context is expanded towards an integral software architecture of a digital twin providing information system. The information system, in turn, ties in with existing forward-oriented planning from operational practice, leading to a significant expansion of the initially presented basic structure for a digital twin. Consequently, a time-stratified data layer platform is introduced to prepare for the resulting shadow-twin transformation loop. Finally, subtasks are defined to assure functional interfaces, model integrability and feedback measures.},

ABSTRACT = {Industry 4.0 radically alters manufacturing organization and management, fostering collection and analysis of increasing amounts of data. Advanced data analytics, such as machine learning (ML), are essential for implementing Industry 4.0 and obtaining insights regarding production, better decision support, and enhanced manufacturing quality and sustainability. ML outperforms traditional approaches in many cases, but its complexity leads to unclear bases for decisions. Thus, acceptance of ML and, concomitantly, Industry 4.0, is hindered due to increasing requirements of fairness, accountability, and transparency, especially in sensitive-use cases. ML does not augment organizational knowledge, which is highly desired by manufacturing experts. Causal discovery promises a solution by providing insights on causal relationships that go beyond traditional ML’s statistical dependency. Causal discovery has a theoretical background and been successfully applied in medicine, genetics, and ecology. However, in manufacturing, only experimental and scattered applications are known; no comprehensive overview about how causal discovery can be applied in manufacturing is available. This paper investigates the state and development of research on causal discovery in manufacturing by focusing on motivations for application, common application scenarios and approaches, impacts, and implementation challenges. Based on the structured literature review, four core areas are identified, and a research agenda is proposed.},

ABSTRACT = {Functionally Graded Materials (FGMs) offer discrete or continuously changing properties/compositions over the volume of the parts. The widespread application of FGMs was not rapid enough in the past due to limitations of the manufacturing methods. Significant developments in manufacturing technologies especially in Additive Manufacturing (AM) enable us nowadays to manufacture materials with specified changes over the volume/surface of components. The use of AM methods for the manufacturing of FGMs may allow us to compensate for some drawbacks of conventional methods and to produce complex and near-net-shaped structures with better control of gradients in a cost-efficient way. Vat Photopolymerization (VP), a type of AM method that works according to the principle of curing liquid photopolymer resin layer-by-layer, has gained in recent years high importance due to its advantages such as low cost, high surface quality control, no need to support structures, no limitation in the material. This article reviews the state-of-art and future potential of using VP methods for FGM manufacturing. It was concluded that improvements in printer hardware setup and software, design aspects and printing methodologies will accelerate the use of VP methods for FGMs manufacturing.},

ABSTRACT = {Nickel–titanium (NiTi) is a shape-memory alloy, a type of material whose name is derived from its ability to recover its original shape upon heating to a certain temperature. NiTi falls under the umbrella of metallic materials, offering high superelasticity, acceptable corrosion resistance, a relatively low elastic modulus, and desirable biocompatibility. There are several challenges regarding the processing and machinability of NiTi, originating from its high ductility and reactivity. Additive manufacturing (AM), commonly known as 3D printing, is a promising candidate for solving problems in the fabrication of near-net-shape NiTi biomaterials with controlled porosity. Powder-bed fusion and directed energy deposition are AM approaches employed to produce synthetic NiTi implants. A short summary of the principles and the pros and cons of these approaches is provided. The influence of the operating parameters, which can change the microstructural features, including the porosity content and orientation of the crystals, on the mechanical properties is addressed. Surface-modification techniques are recommended for suppressing the Ni ion leaching from the surface of AM-fabricated NiTi, which is a technical challenge faced by the long-term in vivo application of NiTi.},
