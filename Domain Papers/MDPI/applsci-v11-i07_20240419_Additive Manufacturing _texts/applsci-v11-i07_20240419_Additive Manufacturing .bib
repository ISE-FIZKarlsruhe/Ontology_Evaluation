ABSTRACT = {The introduction of Additive Manufacturing (AM) is changing the way in which components and machines can be designed and manufactured. Within this context, designers are taking advantage of the possibilities of producing parts via the addition of material, defining strategies, and exploring alternative design or optimization solutions (i.e., nonviable using subtractive technologies) of critical parts (e.g., gears and shafts). However, a safe and effective design requires specific resistance data that, due to the intrinsic modernity of additive technologies, are not always present in the literature. This paper presents the results of an experimental campaign performed on gear-samples made by 17-4 PH and produced via Laser Powder Bed Fusion (PBF-LB/M). The tests were executed using the Single Tooth Bending Fatigue (STBF) approach on a mechanical pulsator. The fatigue limit was determined using two different statistical approaches according to Dixon and Little. The obtained data were compared to those reported in the ISO standard for steels of similar performance. Additional analyses, i.e., Scanning Electron Microscopy SEM, were carried out to provide a further insight of the behavior 17-4PH AM material and in order to investigate the presence of possible defects in the tested gears, responsible for the final failure.},

ABSTRACT = {This study aimed to analyze the defects of large residual stress in laser additive manufacturing metal parts by establishing a milling numerical simulation of Ti6Al4V titanium alloy thin-walled parts based on the Johnson-Cook constitutive model of Ti6Al4V titanium alloy, a modified Coulomb friction stress model, the physical chip separation criterion and other theories, combined with the finite element software ABAQUS. The influences of milling depth, initial temperature and milling speed on the forming quality of the formed part were analyzed. The results show that milling changes the residual stress distribution of the deposition layer, which can reduce or even change the residual tensile stress on the surface of the deposition layer produced by the additive manufacturing process into compressive stress, and the equivalent Mises stress decreases by 47% compared with the original forming surface. When the initial temperature increases from 20 °C to 400 °C, the maximum equivalent Mises stress of the milling surface decreases by 26%.},

ABSTRACT = {Conventional Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) equipment can only deposit materials in a single direction, limiting the strength of printed products. Robotic 3D printing provides more degrees of freedom (DOF) to control the material deposition and has become a trend in additive manufacturing. However, there is little discussion on the strength effect of multi-DOF printing. This paper presents an efficient process framework for multi-axis 3D printing based on the robot to improve the strength. A multi-DOF continuous toolpath planning method is designed to promote the printed part’s strength and surface quality. We generate curve layers along the model surfaces and fill Fermat spiral in the layers. The method makes it possible to take full advantage of the multi-axis robot arm to achieve smooth printing on surfaces with high curvature and avoid the staircase effect and collision in the process. To further improve print quality, a control strategy is provided to synchronize the material extrusion and robot arm movement. Experiments show that the tensile strength increases by 22–167% compared with the conventional flat slicing method for curved-surface parts. The surface quality is improved by eliminating the staircase effect. The continuous toolpath planning also supports continuous fiber-reinforced printing without a cutting device. Finally, we compared with other multi-DOF printing, the application scenarios, and limitations are given.},

ABSTRACT = {Thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) is a life-saving therapy for type B aortic dissection (TBAD). However, surveillance computed tomography (CT) scans in post-TEVAR patients are associated with high radiation dose, thus resulting in potential risk of radiation-induced malignancy. In this study, we developed a patient-specific three-dimensional (3D) printed phantom with stent grafts in situ, then scanned the phantom with different CT protocols to determine the optimal scanning parameters for post-treatment patients. The CT scans were conducted with different kVp and pitch values (80, 100, 120 kVp and pitch of 1.2, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5), resulting in a total of 12 datasets. Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) was measured to determine and compare the image quality between different datasets. Results showed no significant differences in SNR between different kVp when the pitch value was 1.2. At low pitch values, a decrease in kVp from 120 to 80 led to a significant effective dose reduction by more than 20%. SNR decreased by 30% when pitch was increased from 1.2 to 2.5 at 80 kVp, and 20% at 120 kVp. In contrast, there was only a 3.9% decrease in SNR when kVp was reduced from 120 to 80 at pitch 1.2, and 15.9% at pitch 2.5. High pitch with 100 kVp can effectively reduce the dose while maintaining image quality.},

ABSTRACT = {Material extrusion additive manufacturing (MEX) is a versatile technology for producing complex specimens of polymers, ceramics and metals. Highly-filled filaments composed of a binder system and a high-volume content of sinterable powders are needed to produce ceramic or metal parts. After shaping the parts via MEX, the binder is removed and the specimens are sintered to obtain a dense part of the sintered filler particles. In this article, the applicability of this additive manufacturing process to produce copper specimens is demonstrated. The particular emphasis is on investigating the production of lightweight specimens that retain mechanical properties without increasing their weight. The effect of infill grades and the cover presence on the debinding process and the flexural properties of the sintered parts was studied. It was observed that covers could provide the same flexural strength with a maximum weight reduction of approximately 23%. However, a cover on specimens with less than 100% infill significantly slows down the debinding process. The results demonstrate the applicability of MEX to produce lightweight copper specimens.},

ABSTRACT = {Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) is the most common 3D printing technology. An object formed through continuous layering until completion is known as an additive process while other processes with different methods are also relevant. In this paper, mechanical properties were analysed using two distinct kinds of printed polyethylene terephthalate (PET) as tensile test specimens. The materials used consist of recycled PET and virgin PET. An assessment of all the forty test pieces of both kinds of PET was undertaken. A comparison of the test samples’ tensile strength values, difference in stress-strain curves, and elongation at break was also carried out. The reasoning behind the fracturing of test pieces that printed with different settings is presented in part by the depiction of the fractured specimens following the tensile test. An optimal route was revealed to be 3D printing with recycled PET, as per the mechanical testing. The hardness of the recycled filament decreased to 6%, while the tensile strength and shear strength increased to 14.7 and 2.8%, respectively. Nonetheless, no changes occurred to the tensile modulus elasticity. Despite notable differences being observed in the results of the recycled PET filament, no substantial differences were found prior or post-recycling in the mechanical properties of the PET filament. In conclusion, the demand for improved recycled 3D printing filament technologies is heightened due to the comparable mechanical features of the specimens of both the 3D printed recycled and virgin materials. With tensile strength figures reaching as high as 43.15MPa at Recycled PET and 3.12% being the greatest elongation at 40% Recycled PET, 100% Recycled is the ideal printing setting.},

ABSTRACT = {The subject of the present study is the reproduction of a submersible electric pump impeller through reverse engineering and additive manufacturing. All of the phases commonly envisaged in the reproduction of an existing piece were carried out. The aim of the study is to show how the chosen pump component can be effectively re-engineered and produced with the selective laser melting technique, obtaining a final product that is comparable if not even better than the starting one. To achieve this goal, the original piece was redesigned and a new model was created and analyzed. The whole process has been split into three main phases: (i) realization of the three-dimensional model from an existing piece using reverse engineering techniques; (ii) finite element analysis for the optimization of the use of the material; and (iii) 3D printing of a concept model in polyethylene terephthalate by using the fused deposition modeling technology and of the functional model in AISI 316 stainless steel with selective laser melting technology.},

ABSTRACT = {In contrast to the traditional 3D printing process, where material is deposited layer-by-layer on horizontal flat surfaces, conformal 3D printing enables users to create structures on non-planar surfaces for different and innovative applications. Translating a 2D pattern to any arbitrary non-planar surface, such as a tessellated one, is challenging because the available software for printing is limited to planar slicing. The present research outlines an easy-to-use mathematical algorithm to project a printing trajectory as a sequence of points through a vector-defined direction on any triangle-tessellated non-planar surface. The algorithm processes the ordered points of the 2D version of the printing trajectory, the tessellated STL files of the target surface, and the projection direction. It then generates the new trajectory lying on the target surface with the G-code instructions for the printer. As a proof of concept, several examples are presented, including a Hilbert curve and lattices printed on curved surfaces, using a conventional fused filament fabrication machine. The algorithm’s effectiveness is further demonstrated by translating a printing trajectory to an analytical surface. The surface is tessellated and fed to the algorithm as an input to compare the results, demonstrating that the error depends on the resolution of the tessellated surface rather than on the algorithm itself.},

ABSTRACT = {High cost, unpredictable defects and out-of-tolerance rejections in final parts are preventing the complete deployment of Laser-based Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) on an industrial scale. Repeatability, speed and right-first-time manufacturing require synergistic design approaches. In addition, post-build finishing operations of LPBF parts are the object of increasing attention to avoid the risk of bottlenecks in the machining step. An aluminum component for automotive application was redesigned through topology optimization and Design for Additive Manufacturing. Simulation of the build process allowed to choose the orientation and the support location for potential lowest deformation and residual stresses. Design for Finishing was adopted in order to facilitate the machining operations after additive construction. The optical dimensional check proved a good correspondence with the tolerances predicted by process simulation and confirmed part acceptability. A cost and time comparison versus CNC alone attested to the convenience of LPBF unless single parts had to be produced.},

ABSTRACT = {Continuous improvement (CI) is a key component of lean manufacturing (LM), which is fundamental for organizations to remain competitive in an ever more challenging market. At present, the new industrial revolution, Industry 4.0 (I4.0), is taking place in the manufacturing and service markets, allowing more intelligent and automated processes to become a reality through innovative technologies. Not much research was found regarding a holistic application of I4.0′s technological concepts towards CI, which clarifies the potential for improving its effectiveness. This clearly indicates that research is needed regarding this subject. The present publication intends to close this research gap by studying the main I4.0 technological concepts and their possible application towards a typical CI process, establishing the requirements for such an approach. Based on that study, a conceptual approach is proposed (PDCA 4.0), depicting how I4.0 technological concepts should be used for CI enhancement, while aiming to satisfy the identified requirements. By outlining the PDCA 4.0 approach, this paper contributes to increasing the knowledge available regarding the CI realm on how to support the CI shift towards a I4.0 industrial paradigm.},

ABSTRACT = {Railway wheelsets are the key to ensuring the safe operation of trains. To achieve zero-defect production, railway equipment manufacturers must strictly control every link in the wheelset production process. The press-fit curve output by the wheelset assembly machine is an essential indicator of the wheelset’s assembly quality. The operators will still need to manually and individually recheck press-fit curves in our practical case. However, there are many uncertainties in the manual inspection. For example, subjective judgment can easily cause inconsistent judgment results between different inspectors, or the probability of human misinterpretation can increase as the working hours increase. Therefore, this study proposes an intelligent railway wheelset inspection system based on deep learning, which improves the reliability and efficiency of manual inspection of wheelset assembly quality. To solve the severe imbalance in the number of collected images, this study establishes a predicted model of press-fit quality based on a deep Siamese network. Our experimental results show that the precision measurement is outstanding for the testing dataset contained 3863 qualified images and 28 unqualified images of press-fit curves. The proposed system will serve as a successful case of a paradigm shift from traditional manufacturing to digital manufacturing.},

ABSTRACT = {Even though additive manufacturing is receiving increasing interest from aerospace, automotive, and shipbuilding, the legacy approach using tessellated form representation and cross-section slice algorithm still has the essential limitation of its inaccuracy of geometrical information and volumetric losses of final outputs. This paper introduces an innovative method to represent multi-material and multi-directional layers defined in boundary-representation standard model and to process complex sliced layers without missing volumes by using the proposed squashing operation. Applications of the proposed method to a bending part, an internal structure, and an industrial moulding product show the assurance of building original shape without missing volume during the comparison with the legacy method. The results show that using boundary representation and te squashing algorithm in the geometric process of additive manufacturing is expected to improve the inaccuracy that was the barrier of applying additive process to various metal industries.},

ABSTRACT = {Over recent decades, the increasing competitiveness of markets has propagated the term “lean” to describe the management concept for improving productivity, quality, and lead time in industrial as well as services operations. Its overuse and linkage to different specifiers (surnames) have created confusion and misunderstanding as the term approximates pragmatic ambiguity. Through a systematic literature review, this study takes a historical perspective to analyze 4962 papers and 20 seminal books in order to clarify the origin, evolution, and diversification of the lean concept. Our main contribution lies in identifying 17 specifiers for the term “lean” and proposing four mechanisms to explain this diversification. Our research results are useful to both academics and practitioners to return to the Lean origins in order to create new research areas and conduct organizational transformations based on solid concepts. We conclude that the use of “lean” as a systemic thinking is likely to be further extended to new research fields.},

ABSTRACT = {Microstructured steel 40Cr13, which is considered a hard-to-machine steel due to its high mechanical strength and hardness, has wide applications in the dies industry. This study investigates the influence of three process parameters of a 355 nm nanosecond pulse laser on the ablation results of 40Cr13, based on analysis of variance (ANOVA) and back propagation (BP) neural network. The ANOVA results show that laser power has the greatest influence on the ablation depth, width, and material removal rate (MRR), with influence levels of 52.5%, 60.9%, and 70.4%, respectively. The scan speed affects the ablation depth and width to a certain extent, and the influence of the pulse frequency on the ablation depth and MRR is non-negligible. BP neural network models with 3-8-3, 3-10-3, and 3-12-3 structures were applied to predict the ablation results. The results show that the prediction accuracy is relatively high for the ablation width and MRR, with average prediction accuracies of 96.0% and 93.5%. The 3-8-3 network model has the highest prediction accuracy for the ablation width, and the 3-10-3 network model has the highest prediction accuracy for the ablation depth and MRR.},

ABSTRACT = {In recent years, much progress has been made on the development of metal mirrors based on additive manufacturing (AM). The sandwich mirror is well known for its excellent mechanical properties and challenging machining. Now, AM can be used to fabricate this complex structure and reduce the processing time and cost. In addition, with the aid of some new design methods for additive manufacturing, such as lattice, topology optimization (TO), and Voronoi, the freedom of mirror structure design is enormously improved. The common materials of mirrors include ceramics (SiC), glasses (glass ceramics, fused silica), and metals (aluminum, beryllium). Among them, the AM technology of metals is the most mature and widely used. Researchers have recently extensively developed the new-generation metal mirror to improve performance and lightweight rate. This review focuses on the following topics: (1) AM technologies and powder materials for metal mirrors, (2) recent advances in optomechanical design methods for AM metal mirrors, (3) challenges faced by AM metal mirrors in fabricating, and (4) future trends in AM metal mirrors.},

ABSTRACT = {Dissimilar metal joining has always been a challenging task because of the metallurgical incompatibility and difference in melting points of alloys being joined. Diffusion and mixing of alloying elements from dissimilar base metals at the weld often cause unwanted metallurgical changes resulting in unsuccessful welds or underperformance of the weldment. Solid-state dissimilar friction welds of Inconel 718 and F22 were prepared in this study with an Inconel 625 interlayer to address the carbon enrichment of Inconel 718 during the welding. Defect-free rotary friction welds were produced in this study. Microstructural and mechanical properties investigation of the weldments and base metals was carried out, and results were analysed. Intermixing zone was observed at the weld interface due to the softening of the metal at the interface and rotatory motion during the welding. The high temperatures and the plastic deformation of the intermixing zone and thermo-mechanically affected zone (TMAZ) resulted in the grain refinement of the weld region. The highest hardness was observed at the Inconel 718/F22 weld interface due to the plastic strain and the carbon diffusion. The tensile specimens failed in the F22 base metal for the weld prepared with and without the Inconel 625 interlayer. Inconel 718/F22 welds exhibited lower toughness values compared to the Inconel 718/F22 welds prepared with Inconel 625 interlayer.},

The investigation is carried out using multi-objective grasshopper optimization algorithm (MOGOA) and artificial neural network (ANN). Given that the accuracy of a machine learning method depends on the number of data records, and for concrete 3D printing, this number is limited to few years of study, this work develops a new method by combining both methodologies into an ANNMOGOA approach to predict the compressive strength of 3D-printed concrete.

ABSTRACT = {The use of Topology Optimization techniques has seen a great development since the last decade. The principal contributor to this trend is the widespread use of Additive Manufacturing technologies to effectively build complex and performant structures over different settings. Nevertheless, the use of Topology Optimization in Design for Additive Manufacturing processes is not simple and research aims to fill the gap between theory and practice by evolving at the same time both approaches, workflows, and design software that allow their implementation. Since a strong connection between methodologies and tools exists, this work proposes a method to assess computer-aided design tools or platforms. This can be applied to sustain the key phase for selection and adoption of the computer-aided tools in industrial settings embracing Additive Manufacturing. The workflow for Topology Optimization implementation, the structure of the proposed evaluation approach, and its application, are presented to demonstrate effective usability. The automotive case study is the redesign of internal combustion engine piston to benefit of metal Additive Manufacturing based enhanced product performance. A preliminary finite element model is defined and a Topology Optimization based redesign is concurrently set up through four different commercial computer-based platforms. The method accounting for the assessment of required operations for the design optimization is applied to perform the tools selection phase.},

ABSTRACT = {The material properties of 3D printed continuous fiber composites have been studied many times in the last years. However, only a minimal number of samples were used to determine the properties in each of the reported studies. Moreover, reported results can hardly be compared due to different sample geometries. Consequently, the variability of the mechanical properties (from one sample to the other) is a crucial parameter that has not been well quantified yet. In the present work, the flexural properties of 3D printed continuous carbon fiber/nylon composite specimens were experimentally quantified, using batches of 15 test specimens. In order to account for the possible influence of the quality of the prepreg filaments on the observed variability, three different filament rolls were used to manufacture the different batches. Also, two configurations were tested, with a fiber direction parallel (longitudinal) or perpendicular (transverse) to the main axis of the specimens. The results show moderate to high variabilities of the flexural modulus, flexural strength and maximum strain. The coefficient of variation was more than twice as high in the transverse case as in the longitudinal case.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, laser surface treatment of Al alloy was studied by comparison of sandblasting and laser ablation. The effects of laser spot distribution on surface roughness, contact angle, chemical composition and shear strength of Al alloy were analyzed. The experimental results showed that the bonding performance of Al alloy are promoted by controlling the laser spot spacing. When laser spot spacing was smaller than the size of the laser spot, micro–nano composite structures were induced by multiple laser pulses, which would improve shear strength by increasing the contact area between Al alloy and adhesive. Using laser surface treatment, the adhesion properties on Al alloy can be promoted.},

ABSTRACT = {SiC/SiC ceramic matrix composites (CMCs) are widely applied in the aerospace and nuclear industries due to their excellent material nature (strength, hardness, and irradiation tolerance) at high-temperature loads. However, high-quality machining cannot be easily realized because of the anisotropic material structure and its properties. In this study, a laser water jet (LWJ) was adopted for CMCs machining. Firstly, the finite element model (FEM) was established describing a representative three-dimensional microstructure including weft yarn, warp yarn, SiC base, and the pyrolytic carbon (PyC) fiber coating. The temperature distribution, as well as its evolution rule on substrate surface under LWJ machining, was analyzed. Moreover, a single-dot ablation test was carried out to verify the accuracy of the numerical simulation model. Secondly, the variation in maximum temperatures under different laser pulse energy was obtained by means of FEM. Nonetheless, a non-negligible deviation emerged in the ablation depth of the numerical calculation and experimental results. Although the simulation results were obviously superior to the experimental results, their proportions of different machining parameters reached an agreement. This phenomenon can be explained by the processing characteristics of LWJ. Finally, single-row and multi-row scribing experiments for CMCs with 3 mm thickness were developed to clarify the processing capacity of LWJ. The experimental results indicated that single-tow scribing has a limiting value at a groove depth of 2461 μm, while complete cutting off can only be realized by multi-row scribing of LWJ. In addition, the cross-section of CMCs treated by LWJ presented a surface morphology without a recast layer, pulling out of SiC fibers, and delamination. The theoretical and experimental results can offer primary technical support for the high-quality machining of CMCs.},

ABSTRACT = {Imagine the possibility to save a simulation at any time, modify or analyze it, and restart again with exactly the same state. The conceptualization and its concrete manifestation in the implementation OntologySim is demonstrated in this paper. The presented approach of a fully ontology-based simulation can solve current challenges in modeling and simulation in production science. Due to the individualization and customization of products and the resulting increase in complexity of production, a need for flexibly adaptable simulations arises. This need is exemplified in the trend towards Digital Twins and Digital Shadows. Their application to production systems, against the background of an ever increasing speed of change in such systems, is arduous. Moreover, missing understandability and human interpretability of current approaches hinders successful, goal oriented applications. The OntologySim can help solving this challenge by providing the ability to generate truly cyber physical systems, both interlocked with reality and providing a simulation framework. In a nutshell, this paper presents a discrete-event-based open-source simulation using multi-agency and ontology.},

ABSTRACT = {Augmented Reality (AR) has gradually become a mainstream technology enabling Industry 4.0 and its maturity has also grown over time. AR has been applied to support different processes on the shop-floor level, such as assembly, maintenance, etc. As various processes in manufacturing require high quality and near-zero error rates to ensure the demands and safety of end-users, AR can also equip operators with immersive interfaces to enhance productivity, accuracy and autonomy in the quality sector. However, there is currently no systematic review paper about AR technology enhancing the quality sector. The purpose of this paper is to conduct a systematic literature review (SLR) to conclude about the emerging interest in using AR as an assisting technology for the quality sector in an industry 4.0 context. Five research questions (RQs), with a set of selection criteria, are predefined to support the objectives of this SLR. In addition, different research databases are used for the paper identification phase following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) methodology to find the answers for the predefined RQs. It is found that, in spite of staying behind the assembly and maintenance sector in terms of AR-based solutions, there is a tendency towards interest in developing and implementing AR-assisted quality applications. There are three main categories of current AR-based solutions for quality sector, which are AR-based apps as a virtual Lean tool, AR-assisted metrology and AR-based solutions for in-line quality control. In this SLR, an AR architecture layer framework has been improved to classify articles into different layers which are finally integrated into a systematic design and development methodology for the development of long-term AR-based solutions for the quality sector in the future.},

ABSTRACT = {Background—Aircraft inspection is crucial for safe flight operations and is predominantly performed by human operators, who are unreliable, inconsistent, subjective, and prone to err. Thus, advanced technologies offer the potential to overcome those limitations and improve inspection quality. Method—This paper compares the performance of human operators with image processing, artificial intelligence software and 3D scanning for different types of inspection. The results were statistically analysed in terms of inspection accuracy, consistency and time. Additionally, other factors relevant to operations were assessed using a SWOT and weighted factor analysis. Results—The results show that operators’ performance in screen-based inspection tasks was superior to inspection software due to their strong cognitive abilities, decision-making capabilities, versatility and adaptability to changing conditions. In part-based inspection however, 3D scanning outperformed the operator while being significantly slower. Overall, the strength of technological systems lies in their consistency, availability and unbiasedness. Conclusions—The performance of inspection software should improve to be reliably used in blade inspection. While 3D scanning showed the best results, it is not always technically feasible (e.g., in a borescope inspection) nor economically viable. This work provides a list of evaluation criteria beyond solely inspection performance that could be considered when comparing different inspection systems.},

ABSTRACT = {In order to solve the problems of multiple process parameters, difficult control and high process requirements in laser first/second scribing of aerospace chemical milling thin-wall parts, a laser scribing depth model based on thermal energy balance was established, and the relationship between laser power and speed was established with scribing depth as a target. Using AC850 laser scribing maskant as coating material, the effects of laser power, scribing speed, laser frequency, forward angle and side slope angle on the scribing depth were studied by single factor experiment. Experimental results show that the theoretical model is in good agreement with experimental data. The laser scribing depth is positively proportional to the laser power and inversely proportional to the laser speed and has little relationship with the laser frequency. The predicted accuracy of the mathematical equations regarding the laser power density and scribing depth, calculated by the laser power, speed and scribing depths experimental data, are 88.53% and 90.79%. The laser scribing depth at a forward angle of 6° and a side slope angle of 7° is deeper compared with the vertical incident scribing depth, and the angle is also the recommended angle of laser scribing. Based on the simplified regression model, the laser scribing depth model can be directly used in the laser NC system to realize the adaptive adjustment and accurate control of laser energy according to the actual laser speed.},

ABSTRACT = {Wire arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) is the process by which large, metallic structures are built, layer-by-layer, using a welding arc to melt wire feedstock. In this process, the proper selection of the shielding gas plays a vital role in the achievement of structurally acceptable part geometries and quality surface finishes. In this study, the authors used either a ternary mix (He, Ar and CO2) or a binary mix (Ar and CO2) of shielding gases to deposit wall geometries using an open loop-controlled WAAM system developed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory’s Manufacturing Demonstration Facility. The binary blend produced a wider and shorter geometry, while the ternary blend resulted in a narrower build that was more equivalent to the CAD geometry. The data indicated that the binary blend provided a higher oxygen concentration in the weld as compared to that of the ternary blend. The results imply that the arc characteristics and heat input had a significantly higher impact on the weld penetration than the surface tension effect of surface active elements. This was further verified by developing and applying a high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model of the thermophysical properties of gas mixtures. The results from the model showed that, while the influence of increased oxygen concentration on the surface tension for the binary blend led to a deeper penetration, the ternary blend gave rise to heat flux to the workpiece.},

ABSTRACT = {The normal positioning error hinders the use of magnetorheological finishing (MRF) in robotic polishing. In this paper, the influence of robotic normal positioning error on the MRF removal rate is revealed, and a force-controlled end-effector for the robotic MRF process is presented. The developed end-effector is integrated into a six-axis industrial robot, and the robot positions the end-effector while the end-effector realizes the constant force control. A fused silicon mirror is polished, and the result shows that the proposed device effectively compensates for robotic normal positioning error and simultaneously maintains the stability of the polishing process. After deterministic polishing, the PV (peak to valley) of the figure is reduced from 126.56nm to 56.95nm, and the RMS (root mean square) is reduced from 22.15 nm to 7.59 nm.},

ABSTRACT = {Industry 4.0 is leading society into a new era characterized by smart communications between consumers and enterprises. While entertainment and fashion brands aim to consolidate their identities, increasing consumers’ participation in new, engaging, and immersive experiences, other industry sectors such as food and drugs are called to adhere to stricter regulations to increase the quality assurance of their processes. The pharmaceutical industry is inherently one of the most regulated sectors because the safety, integrity, and conservation along the distribution network are the main pillars for guaranteeing the efficacy of drugs for the general public. Favoured by Industry 4.0 incentives, pharmaceutical serialization has become a must in the last few years and is now in place worldwide. In this paper, a decentralized solution based on non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which can improve the track and trace capability of the standard serialization process, is presented. Non-fungible tokens are minted in the blockchain and inherit all the advantages provided by this technology. As blockchain technology is becoming more and more popular, adoption of track and trace will increase tremendously. Focusing on the pharmaceutical industry’s use of track and trace, this paper presents the concepts and architectural elements necessary to support the non-fungible token solution, culminating in the presentation of a use case with a prototypical application.},

ABSTRACT = {The fabrication of components involves the deposition of multiple beads in multiple layers for wire-arc additive manufacturing (WAAM). WAAM performed using gas metal arc welding (GMAW) allows for the manufacturing of parts through multiple-bead multi-layer deposition, which depends on the process variables. Thus, the selection of process parameters along with their required levels is mandatory to deposit multiple layers for WAAM. To obtain the desired levels of parameters, bead-on-plate trials were taken on the base plate of low alloy steel by following an experimental matrix produced through the Box–Behnken design (BBD) on GMAW-based WAAM. Wire feed speed, travel speed, and voltage were chosen as the input parameters and bead width and bead height were chosen as the output parameters. Furthermore, the robustness and adequacy of the obtained regression equations were analyzed by using analysis of variance (ANOVA). For both responses of BW and BH, values of R2 and adj. R2 were found to be near unity, which has shown the fitness of the model. Teaching–learning-based optimization (TLBO) technique was then employed for optimization. Within the selected range of process variables, the single-objective optimization result showed a maximum bead height (BH) of 7.81 mm, and a minimum bead width (BW) of 4.73 mm. To tackle the contradicting nature of responses, Pareto fronts were also generated, which provides a unique non-dominated solution. Validation trials were also conducted to reveal the ability and suitability of the TLBO algorithm. The discrepancy between the anticipated and measured values was observed to be negligible, with a deviation of less than 5% for all the validation trials. This demonstrates the success of the established model and TLBO algorithm. The optimum feasible settings for multi-layer metal deposition were determined after further tuning. A multi-layer structure free from any disbonding was successfully manufactured at the optimized variables. The authors suggest that the optimum parametric settings would be beneficial for the deposition of layer-by-layer weld beads for additive manufacturing of components.},

With the Taguchi method, it was concluded that the nozzle temperature has the most effect on the dimensional accuracy of printed parts. In addition, thermal, mechanical, and rheological characterization were performed on the wax filament, revealing several important findings. For instance, the rheological studies identified the low viscosity of melted wax at printing temperatures. This resulted in the rough surface of the printed parts. To improve the surface roughness, a post-processing procedure was implemented using a white spirit as a surface smoothing agent.},

ABSTRACT = {Machine learning (ML) is one of the artificial intelligence tools which uses past data to learn the relationship between input and output and helps to predict future trends. Powder bed fusion additive manufacturing (PBF-AM) is extensively used for a wide range of applications in the industry. The AM process establishment for new material is a crucial task with trial-and-error approaches. In this work, ML techniques have been applied for the prediction of the density of PBF-AM. Density is the most vital property in evaluating the overall quality of the AM building part. The ML techniques, namely, artificial neural network (ANN), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), and linear regression (LR), are used to develop a model for predicting the density of the stainless steel (SS) 316L build part. These four methods are validated using R-squared values and different error functions to compare the predicted result. The ANN and SVM model performed well with the R-square value of 0.95 and 0.923, respectively, for the density prediction. The ML models would be beneficial for the prediction of the process parameters. Further, the developed ML model would also be helpful for the future application of ML in additive manufacturing.},

ABSTRACT = {Four-dimensional (4D) printing technology, as a next-generation additive manufacturing method, enables printed objects to further change their shapes, functionalities, or properties upon exposure to external stimuli. The 4D printing of programmable and deformable materials such as thermo-responsive shape-memory polymers (trSMPs), which possess the ability to change shape by exposure to heat, has attracted particular interest in recent years. Three-dimensional objects based on SMPs have been proposed for various potential applications in different fields, including soft robotics, smart actuators, biomedical and electronics. To enable the manufacturing of complex multifunctional 3D objects, SMPs are often coupled with other functional polymers or fillers during or before the 3D printing process. This review highlights the 4D printing of state-of-the-art multi-component SMP formulations. Commonly used 4D printing technologies such as material extrusion techniques including fused filament fabrication (FFF) and direct ink writing (DIW), as well as vat photopolymerization techniques such as stereolithography (SLA), digital light processing (DLP), and multi-photon polymerization (MPP), are discussed. Different multicomponent SMP systems, their actuation methods, and potential applications of the 3D printed objects are reviewed. Finally, current challenges and prospects for 4D printing technology are summarized.},

ABSTRACT = {Industry 4.0 is fast becoming a mainstream goal, and many companies are lining up to join the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Small and medium-sized enterprises, especially in the manufacturing industry, are the most heavily challenged in adopting new technology. One of the reasons why these enterprises are lagging behind is the motivation of the key personnel, the decision-makers. The factories in question often do not have a pressing need for advancing to Industry 4.0 and are wary of the risk in doing so. The authors present a rapid, low-cost prototyping solution for the manufacturing companies with legacy machinery intending to adopt the Industry 4.0 paradigm with a low-risk initial step. The legacy machines are retrofitted through the Industrial Internet of Things, making these machines both connectable and capable of providing data, thus enabling process monitoring. The machine chosen as the digitization target was not connectable, and the retrofit was extensive. The choice was made to present the benefits of digitization to the stakeholders quickly and effectively. Indeed, the solution provides immediate results within manufacturing industrial settings, with the ultimate goal being the digital transformation of the entire factory. This work presents an implementation cycle for digitizing an industrial broaching machine, supported by state-of-the-art literature analysis. The methodology utilized in this work is based on the well-known DMAIC strategy customized for the specifics of this case study.},

ABSTRACT = {An existing challenge in the use of continuous fiber reinforcements in additively manufactured parts is the limited availability of suitable fiber materials. This leads to a reduced adaptability of the mechanical properties to the load case. The increased design freedom of additive manufacturing allows the flexible deposition of fiber strands at defined positions, so that even different fiber materials can be easily combined in a printed part. In this work, therefore, an approach is taken to combine carbon and aramid fibers in printed composite parts to investigate their effects on mechanical properties. For this purpose, tensile, flexural and impact tests were performed on printed composite parts made of carbon and aramid fibers in a nylon matrix with five different mixing ratios. The tests showed that the use of hybrid composites for additive manufacturing is a reasonable approach to adapt the mechanical properties to the loading case at hand. The experiments showed that increasing the aramid fiber content resulted in an increase in impact strength, but a decrease in tensile and flexural strength and a decrease in stiffness. Microstructural investigations of the fracture surfaces showed that debonding and delamination were the main failure mechanisms. Finally, Rule of Hybrid Mixture equations were applied to predict the mechanical properties at different mixture ratios. This resulted in predicted values that differed from the experimentally determined values by an average of 5.6%.},

Most of the time, these historical data have been collected by companies without a specific structure, schema, or even best practices, resulting in a potential loss of knowledge. In this paper, we analyze the historical data on maintenance alerts of the components of a revamping topping plant (referred to as RT2) belonging to the SARAS group. This analysis is done in collaboration with the ITALTELECO company, a partner of SARAS, that provided the necessary data. The pre-processing methodology to clean and fill these data and extract features useful for a prediction task will be shown. More in detail, we show the process to fill missing fields of these data to provide (i) a category for each fault by using simple natural language processing techniques and performing a clustering, and (ii) a data structure that can enable machine learning models and statistical approaches to perform reliable failure predictions. The data domain in which this methodology is applied is oil and gas, but it may be generalized and reformulated in various industrial and/or academic fields. The ultimate goal of our work is to obtain a procedure that is simple and can be applied to provide strategic support for the definition of an adequate maintenance plan.},

ABSTRACT = {In this work, blends that were based on first use PP added with talc (PPt) and recycled polypropylene (r-PP) were designed and formulated, aiming at producing filaments that are suitable for 3D printing fused filament fabrication (FFF) processes. A preliminary characterization of PPt/r-PP blends at different weight ratios allowed selecting two systems showing adequate rheological behavior for FFF. The selected blends were melt compounded in a twin-screw extruder, optimizing the processing conditions through a design of experiments approach, involving the use of Taguchi’s method. The materials that were prepared with the optimized processing conditions, hence showing the best performance in terms of rheological behavior and thermal characteristics, were then selected for the production of the filament and for the subsequent FFF processing. Finally, the morphology of the filament and the mechanical properties of 3D-printed samples were assessed, demonstrating the achievement of satisfactory results in terms of performances. In general, the obtained results clearly demonstrated that a proper optimization of both material and processing conditions offers the possibility of using recycled PP-based formulations for additive manufacturing processes, hence allowing a remarkable valorization of a low added-value material through its utilization for an innovative and sustainable manufacturing approach.},

ABSTRACT = {The middle ear bones (‘ossicles’) may become severely damaged due to accidents or to diseases. In these situations, the most common current treatments include replacing them with cadaver-derived ossicles, using a metal (usually titanium) prosthesis, or introducing bridges made of biocompatible ceramics. Neither of these solutions is ideal, due to the difficulty in finding or producing shape-matching replacements. However, the advent of additive manufacturing applications to biomedical problems has created the possibility of 3D-printing anatomically correct, shape- and size-personalized ossicle prostheses. To demonstrate this concept, we generated and printed several models of ossicles, as solid, porous, or soft material structures. These models were first printed with a plottable calcium phosphate/hydroxyapatite paste by extrusion on a solid support or embedded in a Carbopol hydrogel bath, followed by temperature-induced hardening. We then also printed an ossicle model with this ceramic in a porous format, followed by loading and crosslinking an alginate hydrogel within the pores, which was validated by microCT imaging. Finally, ossicle models were printed using alginate as well as a cell-containing nanocellulose-based bioink, within the supporting hydrogel bath. In selected cases, the devised workflow and the printouts were tested for repeatability. In conclusion, we demonstrate that moving beyond simplistic geometric bridges to anatomically realistic constructs is possible by 3D printing with various biocompatible materials and hydrogels, thus opening the way towards the in vitro generation of personalized middle ear prostheses for implantation.},

ABSTRACT = {The development of process parameters for electron beam powder bed fusion (PBF-EB) is usually made with simple geometries and uniform scan lengths. The transfer to complex parts with various scan lengths can be achieved by adapting beam parameters such as beam power and scan speed. Under ideal conditions, this adaption results in a constant energy input into the powder bed despite of the local scan length. However, numerous PBF-EB machines show deviations from the ideal situation because the beam diameter is subject to significant changes if the beam power is changed. This study aims to demonstrate typical scaling issues when applying process parameters to scan lengths up to 45 mm using a fourth generation γ-TiAl alloy. Line energy, area energy, return time, and lateral velocity are kept constant during the additive manufacturing process by adjusting beam power and beam velocity to various scan lengths. Samples produced in this way are examined by light microscopy regarding lateral melt pool extension, melt pool depth, porosity, and microstructure. The process-induced aluminum evaporation is measured by electron probe microanalysis. The experiments reveal undesired changes in melt pool geometry, gas porosity, and aluminum evaporation by increasing the beam power. In detail, beam widening is identified as the reason for the change in melt pool dimensions and microstructure. This finding is supported by numerical calculations from a semi-analytic heat conduction model. This study demonstrates that in-depth knowledge of the electron beam diameter is required to thoroughly control the PBF-EB process, especially when scaling process parameters from simply shaped geometries to complex parts with various scan lengths.},

ABSTRACT = {A display window or store window is the shop’s window that is designed to display items for sale to attract the customers to the stores. Window dressing that depends on visual merchandising is done to make a better impression and implies something dishonest. Knowing the customer from inside and outside through demographic data like ages, psychographics, lifestyles, and behaviors is the main factor that must be kept in display window designer’s mind. The designer takes display colors, light, and signage in consideration. In the presented paper, factors of designing display windows that affect increasing customer attraction and buying rate are studied. An analysis of this variable is established to select which of them have good effects. Optimizing customers’ attraction and buying rate values is carried out by controlling the selected affected variables through a designed and implemented fuzzy logic control system as an artificial intelligence tool. The fuzzy system, used for optimizing the number of viewers for stores’ display windows by controlling the affected factors, is a new approach used in the display window design field.},

ABSTRACT = {Laser Powder Directed Energy Deposition (LP-DED) is a very powerful Additive Manufacturing process for different applications, such as repair operations and the production of functionally graded material. However, the application is still limited, and one of the main reasons is related to the lack of knowledge of the process mechanisms. Since the mechanisms involved in the process, which are mutually related to each other, directly influence the properties of the produced part, their knowledge is crucial. This paper presents a review of the LP-DED mechanisms and the relationship between the input process parameters and related outcomes. The main mechanisms of the LP-DED process, which are identified as (i) laser irradiation and material addition, (ii) melt pool generation, and (iii) subsequent solidification, are discussed in terms of input parameters, with a focus on their effects on the deposition effectiveness, and interrelation among the mechanisms of the deposition process. The results highlight the complexity of the mechanisms involved in the LP-DED process and guide engineers in navigating the challenges of the deposition process, with a specific focus on the critical parameters that should be investigated when new materials are developed, or process optimization is carried out.},

ABSTRACT = {The advancement in 3D printing techniques has raised the hope to use additively manufactured parts as final products in various industries. However, due to the layer-by-layer nature of AM parts, they are highly susceptible to failure when they are subjected to fatigue loading. This review provides a detailed account of the influence of 3D printing parameters on the fatigue properties of parts manufactured by fused filament fabrication (FFF). Existing standards for fatigue testing of polymers and their limitation for 3D-printed parts are discussed. In addition, the cyclic behaviour of polymers is reviewed, and the impact of 3D printing parameters on the mechanical behaviour of FFF parts under tensile, compressive, flexural, and bending fatigue is investigated according to the published results in the literature. Finally, a summary of the works undertaken and suggestions for future research are provided. The influence of 3D printing parameters on the fatigue performance of prints can be different from that seen in the case of static loading and strongly depends on the fatigue loading type. While cross-over infill patterns, higher infill density, and higher layer height favour achieving higher fatigue strength in all loading types, raster orientation is best to be aligned parallel to the tensile loads and perpendicular to the compressive, flexural, and bending forces. In the case of tensile and flexural loading, Y build orientation yields the best result. Finally, print velocity was found to be less significant compared to other parameters, implying that it can be set at high values for faster printing.},

ABSTRACT = {Three-dimensional-printed medical devices are a separate group of medical devices necessary for the development of personalized medicine. The present article discusses a modern and specific group of medical devices and exoskeletons, which aims to present our own experiences in the selection of materials, design, artificial-intelligence optimization, production, and testing of several generations of various upper limb exoskeletons when considering the Medical Devices Regulation (MDR) and the ISO 13485 and ISO 10993 standards. Work is underway to maintain the methodological rigor inherent in medical devices and to develop new business models to achieve cost-effectiveness so that inadequate legislation does not stop the development of this group of technologies (3D scanning, 3D printing, and reverse engineering) in the healthcare system. The gap between research and engineering practice and clinical 3D printing should be bridged as quickly and as carefully as possible. This measure will ensure the transfer of proven solutions into clinical practice. The growing maturity of 3D printing technology will increasingly impact everyday clinical practice, so it is necessary to prepare medical specialists and strategic and organizational changes to realize the correct implementation based on the needs of patients and clinicians.},

ABSTRACT = {Additive manufacturing (AM) of polyetheretherketone (PEEK) biomaterials using the material-extrusion (MEX) method has been studied for years. Because of the challenging manufacturing process, precisely controlling printing parameters is crucial. This study aimed to investigate the effects of printing parameters such as orientation and position of printing on mechanical properties. Thus, 34 samples were printed using PEEK filament and the MEX process. Samples were divided into two main groups (A,B) according to their printing orientations (A: groups 1–3) and positions on the build plate (B: groups 4–8). Mechanical tensile tests were performed to evaluate the effects of different printing orientations and positions on mechanical properties. The means of the tensile modulus in samples 3D-printed in XY (group 1), XZ (group 2), and ZX (group 3) orientations were not significantly different (p-value = 0.063). Groups 1 and 2 had smaller distributions than group 3 in the means of tensile strength. The t-test showed that the overall means of the measurements in groups 4–8 did not differ significantly (p-value = 0.315). The tensile tests indicated that printing in vertical and horizontal orientations had no significant influence on mechanical properties. There were no significant differences in mechanical strength between top/bottom printed samples in five different lateral positions. Reliability of printing with good mechanical properties could be a step forward to manufacturing patient-specific implants.},

ABSTRACT = {Recent advances in electrical machines and energy storage technologies make electric vehicles (EVs) feasible replacements to conventional internal combustion engines. One of the main challenges of high speed electrical machines is providing maximum output power with minimum energy losses, weight, and volume. At high frequency operation, the conductors of AC electrical machines can suffer from skin and proximity effects. This results in high AC losses in the machine windings and can eventually lead to machine failure. In this paper, a novel design for a semi-stranded coil is proposed to limit these undesirable effects. Enabled by additive manufacturing (AM) technology, this sophisticated design is 3D printed using ultralight aluminum alloy. Finally, the AC performance of this coil is measured and compared with conventional single-strand copper coil at different frequency levels. It is found that the proposed design can effectively limit the eddy current losses in the high frequency domain.},

ABSTRACT = {Industrial engineering applications often require manufacturing large components in composite materials to obtain light structures; however, moulds are expensive, especially when manufacturing a limited batch of parts. On the one hand, when traditional approaches are carried out, moulds are milled from large slabs or laminated with composite materials on a model of the part to produce. In this case, the realisation of a mould leads to adding time-consuming operations to the manufacturing process. On the other hand, if a fully additively manufactured approach is chosen, the manufacturing time increases exponentially and does not match the market’s requirements. This research proposes a methodology to improve the production efficiency of large moulds using a hybrid technology by combining additive manufacturing and milling tools. A block of soft material such as foam is milled, and then the printing head of an additive manufacturing machine deposits several layers of plastic material or modelling clay using conformal three-dimensional paths. Finally, the mill can polish the surface, thus obtaining a mould of large dimensions quickly, with reduced cost and without needing trained personnel and handcraft polishing. A software tool has been developed to modify the G-code read by an additive manufacturing machine to obtain material deposition over the soft mould. The authors forced conventional machining instructions to match those of an AM machine. Thus, additive deposition of new material uses 3D conformal trajectories typical of CNC machines. Consequently, communication between two very different instruments using the same language is possible. At first, the code was tested on a modified Fused Filament Fabrication machine whose firmware has been adapted to manage a milling tool and a printing head. Then, the software was tested on a large machine suitable for producing moulds for the large parts typical of marine and aerospace engineering. The research demonstrates that AM technologies can integrate conventional machinery to support the composite materials industry when large parts are required.},

ABSTRACT = {While attracting increasing research attention in science and technology, Machine Learning (ML) is playing a critical role in the digitalization of manufacturing operations towards Industry 4.0. Recently, ML has been applied in several fields of production engineering to solve a variety of tasks with different levels of complexity and performance. However, in spite of the enormous number of ML use cases, there is no guidance or standard for developing ML solutions from ideation to deployment. This paper aims to address this problem by proposing an ML application roadmap for the manufacturing industry based on the state-of-the-art published research on the topic. First, this paper presents two dimensions for formulating ML tasks, namely, ’Four-Know’ (Know-what, Know-why, Know-when, Know-how) and ’Four-Level’ (Product, Process, Machine, System). These are used to analyze ML development trends in manufacturing. Then, the paper provides an implementation pipeline starting from the very early stages of ML solution development and summarizes the available ML methods, including supervised learning methods, semi-supervised methods, unsupervised methods, and reinforcement methods, along with their typical applications. Finally, the paper discusses the current challenges during ML applications and provides an outline of possible directions for future developments.},

ABSTRACT = {Injection molding is one of the most important processes for the mass production of plastic parts. In recent years, many researchers have focused on predicting the occurrence and intensity of defects in injected molded parts, as well as the optimization of process parameters to avoid such defects. One of the most frequent defects of manufactured parts is blush, which usually occurs around the gate location. In this study, to identify the effective parameters on blush formation, eight design parameters with effect probability on the influence of this defect have been investigated. Using a combination of design of experiments (DOE), finite element analysis (FEA), and ANOVA, the most significant parameters have been identified (runner diameter, holding pressure, flow rate, and melt temperature). Furthermore, to provide an efficient predictive model, machine learning methods such as basic artificial neural networks, their combination with genetic algorithms, and particle swarm optimization have been applied and their performance analyzed. It was found that the basic artificial neural network (ANN), with an average accuracy error of 1.3%, provides the closest predictions to the FEA results. Additionally, the process parameters were optimized using ANOVA and a genetic algorithm, which resulted in a significant reduction in the blush defect area.},

ABSTRACT = {The industrial demand for functional filaments made of bio-sourced, biocompatible, biodegradable, and/or recyclable polymers and composites for material extrusion (MEX) 3D printing is continuously growing. Polylactic acid (PLA), the most popular filament, combines such properties, yet its reinforcement with low-cost, inert, and/or recycled fillers remains challenging. Herein, glass in three different micro/nano-forms was the reinforcement agent in PLA. Three different experimental tiers were elaborated by producing composite filaments with glass in powder, beads, and flake forms in various loadings to optimize the concentrations. A thermomechanical process, i.e., melt filament extrusion, was exploited. The composites were evaluated for their thermal degradation stability and composition using thermogravimetric analysis and Raman. MEX 3D printing was used to produce tensile, flexural, impact, and microhardness specimens, to quantitatively evaluate their mechanical response. Field emission scanning electron microscopy evaluation and fractography were carried out to depict fracture patterns of the specimens after their tests. All three glass types induced impressive reinforcement effects (up to 60% in flexural loading), especially in the flake form. The impact of the additional process cost through glass fillers implementation was also assessed, indicating that such composites are cost-effective.},

Traditional 3D printing is typically employed to produce static components, which are not able to fulfill dynamic structural requirements and are inappropriate for applications such as soft grippers, self-assembly systems, and smart actuators. To address this limitation, an innovative technology has emerged, known as “4D printing”. It processes smart materials by using 3D printing for fabricating smart structures that can be reconfigured by applying different inputs, such as heat, humidity, magnetism, electricity, light, etc. At present, 4D printing is still a growing technology, and it presents numerous challenges regarding materials, design, simulation, fabrication processes, applied strategies, and reversibility. In this work a critical review of 4D printing technologies, materials, and applications is provided.},
