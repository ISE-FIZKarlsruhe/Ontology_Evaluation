ABSTRACT = {At elevated temperatures, the ionic liquid precursor (ILP) tetrabutylammonium hydroxide reacts with zinc acetate and the glass wall of the reaction vessel. While the reaction of OH- with the glass wall is not surprising as such and could be considered a failed experiment, the resulting materials are interesting for a variety of applications. If done on purpose and under controlled conditions, the reaction with the glass wall results in uniform, well-defined hemimorphite Zn4Si2O7(OH)2·nH2O and willemite Zn2SiO4 microcrystals and films. Their morphology can be adjusted by variation of the reaction time and reaction temperature. The hemimorphite can be transformed to Zn2SiO4 via calcination. The process is therefore a viable approach for the fabrication of porous films on glass surfaces with potential applications as catalyst support, among others.},

ABSTRACT = {Membrane-covered Express2TM Monorail® stents composed of chitosan (CH) blended with polyethylene oxide (PEO) in 70:30% wt (CH-PEO) were coated with a monolayer of hyaluronic acid (HA). This significantly improved the resistance to platelet adhesion and demonstrated excellent mechanical properties, resisting the harsh conditions during stent crimping and subsequent inflation. CH-PEO/HA membrane was then combined with a paclitaxel (Pac) delivery system via three different approaches for comparison of release profiles of Pac. The activity of Pac in these systems was confirmed since its presence in the membrane significantly decreased cell viability of U937 macrophages. Presented results are promising for applications requiring different release patterns of hydrophobic drugs.},

ABSTRACT = {This study aims to determine the effects of appropriate experimental parameters on the thermophysical properties of molten micro droplets, Sn-3Ag-0.5Cu solder balls with an average droplet diameter of 50 μm were prepared. The inkjet printing parameters of the molten micro droplets, such as the dot spacing, stage velocity and sample temperature, were optimized in the 1D and 2D printing of metallic microstructures. The impact and mergence of molten micro droplets were observed with a high-speed digital camera. The line width of each sample was then calculated using a formula over a temperature range of 30 to 70 °C. The results showed that a metallic line with a width of 55 μm can be successfully printed with dot spacing (50 μm) and the stage velocity (50 mm∙s−1) at the substrate temperature of 30 °C. The experimental results revealed that the height (from 0.63 to 0.58) and solidification contact angle (from 72° to 56°) of the metallic micro droplets decreased as the temperature of the sample increased from 30 to 70 °C. High-speed digital camera (HSDC) observations showed that the quality of the 3D micro patterns improved significantly when the droplets were deposited at 70 °C.},

ABSTRACT = {Formation of cracks impairs the durability of concrete elements. Corrosion inducing substances, such as chlorides, can enter the matrix through these cracks and cause steel reinforcement corrosion and concrete degradation. Self-repair of concrete cracks is an innovative technique which has been studied extensively during the past decade and which may help to increase the sustainability of concrete. However, the experiments conducted until now did not allow for an assessment of the service life extension possible with self-healing concrete in comparison with traditional (cracked) concrete. In this research, a service life prediction of self-healing concrete was done based on input from chloride diffusion tests. Self-healing of cracks with encapsulated polyurethane precursor formed a partial barrier against immediate ingress of chlorides through the cracks. Application of self-healing concrete was able to reduce the chloride concentration in a cracked zone by 75% or more. As a result, service life of steel reinforced self-healing concrete slabs in marine environments could amount to 60–94 years as opposed to only seven years for ordinary (cracked) concrete. Subsequent life cycle assessment calculations indicated important environmental benefits (56%–75%) for the ten CML-IA (Center of Environmental Science of Leiden University–Impact Assessment) baseline impact indicators which are mainly induced by the achievable service life extension.},

ABSTRACT = {It is extremely difficult to predict the initiation time of cracking due to a large time spread in most cracking experiments. Thus, probabilistic models, such as the Weibull distribution, are usually employed to model the initiation time of cracking. Therefore, the parameters of the Weibull distribution are estimated from data collected from a cracking test. However, although the development of a reliable cracking model under ideal experimental conditions (e.g., a large number of specimens and narrow censoring intervals) could be achieved in principle, it is not straightforward to quantitatively assess the effects of the ideal experimental conditions on model estimation uncertainty. The present study investigated the effects of key experimental conditions, including the time-dependent effect of the censoring interval length, on the estimation uncertainties of the Weibull parameters through Monte Carlo simulations. The simulation results provided quantified estimation uncertainties of Weibull parameters in various cracking test conditions. Hence, it is expected that the results of this study can offer some insight for experimenters developing a probabilistic crack initiation model by performing experiments.},

ABSTRACT = {The results of Lamb wave identification for the aerospace structures could be easily affected by the nonlinear-dispersion characteristics. In this paper, dispersion compensation of Lamb waves is of particular concern. Compared with the similar research works on the traditional signal domain transform methods, this study is based on signal construction from the viewpoint of nonlinear wavenumber linearization. Two compensation methods of linearly-dispersive signal construction (LDSC) and non-dispersive signal construction (NDSC) are proposed. Furthermore, to improve the compensation effect, the influence of the signal construction process on the other crucial signal properties, including the signal waveform and amplitude spectrum, is considered during the investigation. The linear-dispersion and non-dispersion effects are firstly analyzed. Then, after the basic signal construction principle is explored, the numerical realization of LDSC and NDSC is discussed, in which the signal waveform and amplitude spectrum preservation is especially regarded. Subsequently, associated with the delay-and-sum algorithm, LDSC or NDSC is employed for high spatial resolution damage imaging, so that the adjacent multi-damage or quantitative imaging capacity of Lamb waves can be strengthened. To verify the proposed signal construction and damage imaging methods, the experimental and numerical validation is finally arranged on the aluminum plates.},

ABSTRACT = {The filling of strand corrosion products during concrete crack propagation is investigated experimentally in the present paper. The effects of stirrups on the filling of corrosion products and concrete cracking are clarified. A prediction model of crack width is developed incorporating the filling proportion of corrosion products and the twisting shape of the strand. Experimental data on cracking angle, crack width, and corrosion loss obtained from accelerated corrosion tests of concrete beams are presented. The proposed model is verified by experimental data. Results show that the filling extent of corrosion products varies with crack propagation. The rust filling extent increases with the propagating crack until a critical width. Beyond the critical width, the rust-filling extent remains stable. Using stirrups can decrease the critical crack width. Stirrups can restrict crack propagation and reduce the rust filling. The tangent of the cracking angle increases with increasing corrosion loss. The prediction of corrosion-induced crack is sensitive to the rust-filling extent.},

ABSTRACT = {A detailed investigation of the recording, as well as the readout of transmission gratings in composites of poly(ethylene glycol) dimethacrylate (PEGDMA) and ionic liquids is presented. Gratings with a period of about 5.8 micrometers were recorded using a two-wave mixing technique with a coherent laser beam of a 355-nm wavelength. A series of samples with grating thicknesses d 0 = 10 … 150 micrometers, each for two different exposure times, was prepared. The recording kinetics, as well as the post-exposure properties of the gratings were monitored by diffracting a low intensity probe beam at a wavelength of 633 nm for Bragg incidence. To obtain a complete characterization, two-beam coupling experiments were conducted to clarify the type and the strength of the recorded gratings. Finally, the diffraction efficiency was measured as a function of the readout angle at different post-exposure times. We found that, depending on the parameters, different grating types (pure phase and/or mixed) are generated, and at elevated thicknesses, strong light-induced scattering develops. The measured angular dependence of the diffraction efficiency can be fitted using a five-wave coupling theory assuming an attenuation of the gratings along the thickness. For grating thicknesses larger than 85 microns, light-induced scattering becomes increasingly important. The latter is an obstacle for recording thicker holograms, as it destroys the recording interference pattern with increasing sample depth. The obtained results are valuable in particular when considering PEGDMA-ionic liquid composites in the synthesis of advanced polymer composites for applications, such as biomaterials, conductive polymers and holographic storage materials.},

ABSTRACT = {Polymeric capsules can have an advantage over glass capsules used up to now as proof-of-concept carriers in self-healing concrete. They allow easier processing and afford the possibility to fine tune their mechanical properties. Out of the multiple requirements for capsules used in this context, the capability of rupturing when crossed by a crack in concrete of a typical size is one of the most relevant, as without it no healing agent is released into the crack. This study assessed the fitness of five types of polymeric capsules to fulfill this requirement by using a numerical model to screen the best performing ones and verifying their fitness with experimental methods. Capsules made of a specific type of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) were considered fit for the intended application, rupturing at average crack sizes of 69 and 128 μm, respectively for a wall thickness of ~0.3 and ~0.7 mm. Thicker walls were considered unfit, as they ruptured for crack sizes much higher than 100 μm. Other types of PMMA used and polylactic acid were equally unfit for the same reason. There was overall good fitting between model output and experimental results and an elongation at break of 1.5% is recommended regarding polymers for this application.},

The corrosion behavior was studied by conducting electrochemical tests in 0.9% NaCl solution while the bioactivity was evaluated by soaking the specimens in simulated body fluid (SBF). Under identical anodization conditions, the PEO film thicknesses increased with increasing Ca content in the alloys, which enhanced the corrosion resistance in NaCl solution. Thicker apatite layers grew on the PEO films of Ca-containing alloys because Ca was incorporated into the PEO film and because Ca was present in the alloys. Improvement of corrosion resistance and bioactivity of the PEO-coated AM60 by alloying with Ca may be beneficial for biodegradable implant applications.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper numerically investigates the seismic response of the filled joint under high amplitude stress waves using the combined finite-discrete element method (FDEM). A thin layer of independent polygonal particles are used to simulate the joint fillings. Each particle is meshed using the Delaunay triangulation scheme and can be crushed when the load exceeds its strength. The propagation of the 1D longitude wave through a single filled joint is studied, considering the influences of the joint thickness and the characteristics of the incident wave, such as the amplitude and frequency. The results show that the filled particles under high amplitude stress waves mainly experience three deformation stages: (i) initial compaction stage; (ii) crushing stage; and (iii) crushing and compaction stage. In the initial compaction stage and crushing and compaction stage, compaction dominates the mechanical behavior of the joint, and the particle area distribution curve varies little. In these stages, the transmission coefficient increases with the increase of the amplitude, i.e., peak particle velocity (PPV), of the incident wave. On the other hand, in the crushing stage, particle crushing plays the dominant role. The particle size distribution curve changes abruptly with the PPV due to the fragments created by the crushing process. This process consumes part of wave energy and reduces the stiffness of the filled joint. The transmission coefficient decreases with increasing PPV in this stage because of the increased amount of energy consumed by crushing. Moreover, with the increase of the frequency of the incident wave, the transmission coefficient decreases and fewer particles can be crushed. Under the same incident wave, the transmission coefficient decreases when the filled thickness increases and the filled particles become more difficult to be crushed.},

ABSTRACT = {The influence of Co (Ni) and B co-doping on the structural, magnetic and magnetocaloric properties of (Mn,Fe) 2 (P,Si) compounds is investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential scanning calorimetry, magnetic and direct temperature change measurements. It is found that Co (Ni) and B co-doping is an effective approach to tune both the Curie temperature and the thermal hysteresis of (Mn,Fe) 2 (P,Si) materials without losing either the giant magnetocaloric effect or the positive effect of the B substitution on the mechanical stability. An increase in B concentration leads to a rapid decrease in thermal hysteresis, while an increase in the Co or Ni concentration hardly changes the thermal hysteresis of the (Mn,Fe) 2 (P,Si) compounds. However, the Curie temperature decreases slowly as a function of the Co or Ni content, while it increases dramatically for increasing B concentration. Hence, the co-substitution of Fe and P by Co (Ni) and B, respectively, offers a new control parameter to adjust the Curie temperature and reduce the thermal hysteresis of the (Mn,Fe) 2 (P,Si) materials.},

A high-throughput screening method combining diffusion couples, key alloys, Scanning Electron Microscope/Wavelength Dispersive X-ray Spectroscope (SEM/WDS), and Magnetic Force Microscope (MFM) is used in this research to understand the phase equilibria and to explore promising magnetic phases in this system. Three magnetic phases were detected and their homogeneity ranges were determined at 900 °C, which were presented by the formulae: Ce2Fe14−xCoxB (0 ≤ x ≤ 4.76), CeCo4−xFexB (0 ≤ x ≤ 3.18), and Ce3Co11−x FexB4 (0 ≤ x ≤ 6.66). The phase relations among the magnetic phases in this system have been studied. Ce2(Fe, Co)14B appears to have stronger magnetization than Ce(Co, Fe)4B and Ce3(Co, Fe)11B4 from MFM analysis when comparing the magnetic interactions of selected key alloys. Also, a non-magnetic CeCo12−xFexB6 (0 ≤ x ≤ 8.74) phase was detected in this system. A boron-rich solid solution with Ce13FexCoyB45 (32 ≤ x ≤ 39, 3 ≤ y ≤ 10) chemical composition was also observed. However, the crystal structure of this phase could not be found in the literature. Moreover, ternary solid solutions ε1 (Ce2Fe17−xCox (0 ≤ x ≤ 12.35)) and ε2 (Ce2Co17−xFex (0 ≤ x ≤ 3.57)) were found to form between Ce2Fe17 and Ce2Co17 in the Ce-Fe-Co ternary system at 900 °C.},

ABSTRACT = {The microstructural evolution of Dy2O3-TiO2 powder mixtures during ball milling and post-milled annealing was investigated using XRD, SEM, TEM, and DSC. At high ball-milling rotation speeds, the mixtures were fined, homogenized, nanocrystallized, and later completely amorphized, and the transformation of Dy2O3 from the cubic to the monoclinic crystal structure was observed. The amorphous transformation resulted from monoclinic Dy2O3, not from cubic Dy2O3. However, at low ball-milling rotation speeds, the mixtures were only fined and homogenized. An intermediate phase with a similar crystal structure to that of cubic Dy2TiO5 was detected in the amorphous mixtures annealed from 800 to 1000 °C, which was a metastable phase that transformed to orthorhombic Dy2TiO5 when the annealing temperature was above 1050 °C. However, at the same annealing temperatures, pyrochlore Dy2Ti2O7 initially formed and subsequently reacted with the remaining Dy2O3 to form orthorhombic Dy2TiO5 in the homogenous mixtures. The evolutionary mechanism of powder mixtures during ball milling and subsequent annealing was analyzed.},

ABSTRACT = {Eu3+-modified carbon dots (C-dots), 3–5 nm in diameter, were prepared, functionalized, and stabilized via a one-pot polyol synthesis. The role of Eu2+/Eu3+, the influence of O2 (oxidation) and H2O (hydrolysis), as well as the impact of the heating procedure (conventional resistance heating and microwave (MW) heating) were explored. With the reducing conditions of the polyol at the elevated temperature of synthesis (200–230 °C), first of all, Eu2+ was obtained resulting in the blue emission of the C-dots. Subsequent to O2-driven oxidation, Eu3+-modified, red-emitting C-dots were realized. However, the Eu3+ emission is rapidly quenched by water for C-dots prepared via conventional resistance heating. In contrast to the hydroxyl functionalization of conventionally-heated C-dots, MW-heating results in a carboxylate functionalization of the C-dots. Carboxylate-coordinated Eu3+, however, turned out as highly stable even in water. Based on this fundamental understanding of synthesis and material, in sum, a one-pot polyol approach is established that results in H2O-dispersable C-dots with intense red Eu3+-line-type emission.},

The basic idea of HBT is similar to the small punch test (SPT), but inspired by the manufacturing process of rupture discs—high-pressure hydraulic oil is used instead of punch to cause specimen deformation. Compared with SPT method, the HBT method can avoid some of influence factors, such as punch dimension, punch material, and the friction between punch and specimen. A calculation procedure that is entirely based on theoretical derivation is proposed for estimate yield strength and ultimate tensile strength. Both conventional tensile tests and hydraulic bulge tests were carried out for several ferrous alloys, and the results showed that hydraulic bulge test results are reliable and accurate.},

The results are discussed in terms of roughness, geometry of the fusion zone in the cross-section, microstructural modification, and microhardness so as to assess the effects of laser post processing. The benefits of beam wobbling over linear scanning processing are shown, as heat effects in the base metal are proven to be lower.},

ABSTRACT = {In this study, bisphasic calcium phosphate (BCP) and two types of polysaccharide, carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and hyaluronic acid (HyA), were used to fabricate composite block bone grafts, and their physical and biological features and performances were compared and evaluated in vitro and in vivo. Specimens of the following were prepared as 6 mm diameter, 2 mm thick discs; BPC mixed with CMC (the BCP/CMC group), BCP mixed with crosslinked CMC (the BCP/c-CMC group) and BCP mixed with HyA (the BCP/HyA group) and a control group (specimens were prepared using particle type BCP). A scanning electron microscope study, a compressive strength analysis, and a cytotoxicity assessment were conducted. Graft materials were implanted in each of four circular defects of 6 mm diameter in calvarial bone in seven rabbits. Animals were sacrificed after four weeks for micro-CT and histomorphometric analyses, and the findings obtained were used to calculate new bone volumes (mm3) and area percentages (%). It was found that these two values were significantly higher in the BCP/c-CMC group than in the other three groups (p < 0.05). Within the limitations of this study, BCP composite block bone graft material incorporating crosslinked CMC has potential utility when bone augmentation is needed.},

ABSTRACT = {Encapsulation of healing agents embedded in a material matrix has become one of the major approaches for achieving self-healing function in cementitious materials in recent years. A novel type of microcapsules based self-healing cementitious composite was developed in Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Durability for Marine Civil Engineering, Shenzhen University. In this study, both macro performance and the microstructure of the composite are investigated. The macro performance was evaluated by employing the compressive strength and the dynamic modulus, whereas the microstructure was represented by the pore structure parameters such as porosity, cumulative-pore volume, and average-pore diameter, which are significantly correlated to the pore-size distribution and the compressive strength. The results showed that both the compressive strength and the dynamic modulus, as well as the pore structure parameters such as porosity, cumulative-pore volume, and average-pore diameter of the specimen decrease to some extent with the amount of microcapsules. However, the self-healing rate and the recovery rate of the specimen performance and the pore-structure parameters increase with the amount of microcapsules. The results should confirm the self-healing function of microcapsules in the cementitious composite from macroscopic and microscopic viewpoints.},

ABSTRACT = {To satisfy the need of polymer connection in lightweight automobiles, a study on laser transmission spot welding using polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) is conducted by using an Nd:YAG pulse laser. The influence of three variables, namely peak voltages, defocusing distances and the welding type (type I (pulse frequency and the duration is 25 Hz, 0.6 s) and type II (pulse frequency and the duration is 5 Hz, 3 s)) to the welding quality was investigated. The result showed that, in the case of the same peak voltages and defocusing distances, the number of bubbles for type I was obviously more than type II. The failure mode of type I was the base plate fracture along the solder joint, and the connection strength of type I was greater than type II. The weld pool diameter:depth ratio for type I was significantly greater than type II. It could be seen that there was a certain relationship between the weld pool diameter:depth ratio and the welding strength. By the finite element simulation, the weld pool for type I was more slender than type II, which was approximately the same as the experimental results.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper reports on efforts to enhance the photovoltaic performance of textured silicon solar cells through the application of a layer of Eu-doped silicate phosphor with particles of various dimensions using the spin-on film technique. We examined the surface profile and dimensions of the Eu-doped phosphors in the silicate layer using optical microscopy with J-image software. Optical reflectance, photoluminescence, and external quantum efficiency were used to characterize the luminescent downshifting (LDS) and light scattering of the Eu-doped silicate phosphor layer. Current density-voltage curves under AM 1.5G simulation were used to confirm the contribution of LDS and light scattering produced by phosphor particles of various dimensions. Experiment results reveal that smaller phosphor particles have a more pronounced effect on LDS and a slight shading of incident light. The application of small Eu-doped phosphor particles increased the conversion efficiency by 9.2% (from 12.56% to 13.86%), far exceeding the 5.6% improvement (from 12.54% to 13.32%) achieved by applying a 250 nm layer of SiO2 and the 4.5% improvement (from 12.37% to 12.98%) observed in cells with large Eu-doped phosphor particles.},

ABSTRACT = {The effect of intrinsic stress on the structure and physical properties of silicon-tin-oxide (STO) films have been investigated. Since a state of tensile stress is available in as-deposited films, the value of stress can be exponentially enhanced when the annealing temperature is increased. The tensile stress is able to not only suppress the crystallization and widen the optical band gap of STO films, but also reduce defects of STO films. In this report, the good electrical performance of STO thin-film transistors (TFTs) can be obtained when annealing temperature is 450 °C. This includes a value of saturation mobility that can be reached at 6.7 cm2/Vs, a ratio of Ion/Ioff as 7.34 × 107, a steep sub-threshold swing at 0.625 V/decade, and a low trap density of 7.96 × 1011 eV−1·cm−2, respectively.},

ABSTRACT = {Glass-ionomer-cement (GIC) is helpful in Minimal Intervention Dentistry because it releases fluoride ions and is highly biocompatible. The aim of this study is to investigate the mechanisms by which hydroxyapatite (HAp) improves the mechanical strength and bioactive functioning of GIC when these materials are combined to make apatite ionomer cement (AIC). A conventional GIC powder was mixed with porous, spherical-HAp particles (HApS), crystalline HAp (HAp200) or one of two types of cellulose. The micro-compressive strengths of the additive particles were measured, and various specimens were evaluated with regard to their compressive strengths (CS), fluoride release concentrations (fluoride electrode) and multi-element release concentrations. The AIC was found to release higher concentrations of fluoride (1.2 times) and strontium ions (1.5 times) compared to the control GIC. It was detected the more release of calcium originated from HApS than HAp200 in AIC. The CS of the AIC incorporating an optimum level of HAp was also significantly higher than that of the GIC. These results suggest that adding HAp can increase the release concentration of ions required for remineralization while maintaining the CS of the GIC. This effect does not result from a physical phenomenon, but rather from chemical reactions between the HAp and polyacrylic acid of GIC.},

ABSTRACT = {The visible-light-driven photocatalytic degradation of Bisphenol A (BPA) was investigated using the binary composite of alkaline treated g-C3N4 (HT-g-C3N4) deposited over commercial TiO2 (Evonik Degussa GmbH, Essen, Germany). The existence and contribution of both TiO2 and g-C3N4/HT-g-C3N4 in the composite was confirmed through various analytical techniques including powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-vis-DRS), and photoluminescence (PL) analysis. The results showed that the titania in the binary composite exhibited both pure rutile and anatase phases. The morphological analysis indicated that the spongy “morel-like” structure of g-C3N4 turned to nanotube form after alkaline hydrothermal treatment and thereby decreased the specific surface area of HT-g-C3N4. The low surface area of HT-g-C3N4 dominates its promising optical property and effective charge transfer, resulting in a deprived degradation efficiency of BPA two times lower than pure g-C3N4. The binary composite of HT-g-C3N4/TiO2 exhibited excellent degradation efficiency of BPA with 2.16 times higher than the pure HT-g-C3N4. The enhanced photocatalytic activity was mainly due to the promising optical band gap structure with heterojunction interface, favorable specific surface area, and good charge separation.},

ABSTRACT = {We introduce optically clear and resilient free-form micro-optical components of pure (non-photosensitized) organic-inorganic SZ2080 material made by femtosecond 3D laser lithography (3DLL). This is advantageous for rapid printing of 3D micro-/nano-optics, including their integration directly onto optical fibers. A systematic study of the fabrication peculiarities and quality of resultant structures is performed. Comparison of microlens resiliency to continuous wave (CW) and femtosecond pulsed exposure is determined. Experimental results prove that pure SZ2080 is ∼20 fold more resistant to high irradiance as compared with standard lithographic material (SU8) and can sustain up to 1.91 GW/cm2 intensity. 3DLL is a promising manufacturing approach for high-intensity micro-optics for emerging ﬁelds in astro-photonics and atto-second pulse generation. Additionally, pyrolysis is employed to homogeneously shrink structures up to 40% by removing organic SZ2080 constituents. This opens a promising route towards downscaling photonic lattices and the creation of mechanically robust glass-ceramic microstructures.},

ABSTRACT = {The unidirectional porous hydroxyapatite HAp (UDPHAp) is a scaffold with continuous communicated pore structure in the axial direction. We evaluated and compared the ability of the UDPHAp as a three-dimensional (3D) bone tissue engineering scaffold to the interconnected calcium porous HAp ceramic (IP-CHA). To achieve this, we evaluated in vitro the compressive strength, controlled rhBMP-2 release behavior, adherent cell morphology, cell adhesion manner, and cell attachment of UDPHAp. As a further in vivo experiment, UDPHAp and IP-CHA with rhBMP-2 were transplanted into mouse calvarial defects to evaluate their bone-forming ability. The Results demonstrated that the maximum compressive strengths of the UDPHAp was 7.89 ± 1.23 MPa and higher than that of IP-CHA (1.92 ± 0.53 MPa) (p = 0.0039). However, the breaking energies were similar (8.99 ± 2.72 vs. 13.95 ± 5.69 mJ, p = 0.055). The UDPHAp released rhBMP-2 more gradually in vivo. Cells on the UDPHAp adhered tightly to the surface, which had grown deeply into the scaffolds. A significant increase in cell number on the UDPHAp was observed compared to the IP-CHA on day 8 (102,479 ± 34,391 vs. 32,372 ± 29,061 estimated cells per scaffold, p = 0.0495). In a mouse calvarial defect model, the percentages of new bone area (mature bone + trabecular bone) in the 2x field were 2.514% ± 1.224% for the IP-CHA group and 7.045% ± 2.055% for the UDPHAp group, and the percentage was significantly higher in the UDPHAp group (p = 0.0209). While maintaining the same strength as the IP-CHA, the UDPHAp with 84% porosity showed a high cell number, high cell invasiveness, and excellent bone formation. We believe the UDPHAp is an excellent material that can be applied to bone regenerative medicine.},

ABSTRACT = {The mechanical properties and anti-caries effect of a novel anti-caries adhesive containing poly (amidoamine) dendrimer (PAMAM) and dimethylaminododecyl methacrylate (DMADDM) were investigated for the first time. Microtensile bond strength and surface charge density were measured for the novel anti-caries adhesives. Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguinis, and Streptococcus gordonii were chosen to form three-species biofilms. Lactic acid assay, MTT (3-(4,5-Dimethyl-thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay, exopolysaccharide staining and live/dead staining were performed to study anti-biofilm effect of the adhesive. The TaqMan realtime polymerase chain reaction was used to study the proportion change in three-species biofilms of different groups. The Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) was used to observe the remineralization effect of PAMAM and DMADDM. The results showed that incorporating PAMAM and DMADDM into adhesive had no adverse effect on the dentin bond strength. The 1% PAMAM and 5% DMADDM adhesive group showed anti-biofilm properties and developed a healthier biofilm with a lower chance of inducing dental caries. Combination of 1% PAMAM and 5% DMADDM solution maintained remineralization capability on dentin, similar to that using 1% PAMAM alone. In conclusion, the adhesive containing PAMAM and DMADDM had strong antimicrobial properties and biological remineralization capabilities, and is promising for anti-caries clinical applications.},

ABSTRACT = {Finite element modeling has been widely used to simulate the mechanical behavior of the intervertebral disc. Previous models have been generally limited to the prediction of the disc behavior under simple loading conditions, thus neglecting its response to complex loads, which may induce its failure. The aim of this study was to generate a finite element model of the ovine lumbar intervertebral disc, in which the annulus was characterized by an anisotropic hyperelastic formulation, and to use it to define which mechanical condition was unsafe for the disc. Based on published in vitro results, numerical analyses under combined flexion, lateral bending, and axial rotation with a magnitude double that of the physiological ones were performed. The simulations showed that flexion was the most unsafe load and an axial tensile stress greater than 10 MPa can cause disc failure. The numerical model here presented can be used to predict the failure of the disc under all loading conditions, which may support indications about the degree of safety of specific motions and daily activities, such as weight lifting.},

Close to fracture, significant variations in local temperatures and strains are observed, and it is shown that the variations in temperature and strain can be used to predict imminent fracture. It is noted that the latter information cannot be obtained using external strain gages, which underlines the importance of the tracking of local strains internally.},

ABSTRACT = {Non-isothermal conditions during flight cycles have long led to the requirement for thermo-mechanical fatigue (TMF) evaluation of aerospace materials. However, the increased temperatures within the gas turbine engine have meant that the requirements for TMF testing now extend to disc alloys along with blade materials. As such, fatigue crack growth rates are required to be evaluated under non-isothermal conditions along with the development of a detailed understanding of related failure mechanisms. In the current work, a TMF crack growth testing method has been developed utilising induction heating and direct current potential drop techniques for polycrystalline nickel-based superalloys, such as RR1000. Results have shown that in-phase (IP) testing produces accelerated crack growth rates compared with out-of-phase (OOP) due to increased temperature at peak stress and therefore increased time dependent crack growth. The ordering of the crack growth rates is supported by detailed fractographic analysis which shows intergranular crack growth in IP test specimens, and transgranular crack growth in 90° OOP and 180° OOP tests. Isothermal tests have also been carried out for comparison of crack growth rates at the point of peak stress in the TMF cycles.},

ABSTRACT = {In pelvic fracture operations, bone plate shaping is challenging and the operation time is long. To address this issue, a customized bone plate was designed and produced using selective laser melting (SLM) technology. The key steps of this study included designing the customized bone plate, metal 3D printing, vacuum heat treatment, surface post-processing, operation rehearsal, and clinical application and evaluation. The joint surface of the bone plate was placed upwards with respect to the build platform to keep it away from the support and to improve the quality of the joint surface. Heat conduction was enhanced by adding a cone-type support beneath the bone plate to prevent low-quality fabrication due to poor heat conductivity of the Ti-6Al-4V powder. The residual stress was eliminated by exposing the SLM-fabricated titanium-alloy bone plate to a vacuum heat treatment. Results indicated that the bone plate has a hardness of HV1 360–HV1 390, an ultimate tensile strength of 1000–1100 MPa, yield strength of 900–950 MPa, and an elongation of 8%–10%. Pre-operative experiments and operation rehearsal were performed using the customized bone plate and the ABC-made pelvic model. Finally, the customized bone plate was clinically applied. The intraoperative C-arm and postoperative X-ray imaging results indicated that the customized bone plate matched well to the damaged pelvis. The customized bone plate fixed the broken bone and guides pelvis restoration while reducing operation time to about two hours. The customized bone plate eliminated the need for preoperative titanium plate pre-bending, thereby greatly reducing surgical wounds and operation time.},

ABSTRACT = {The adsorption of H2 on LaNiO3 was investigated using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The adsorption sites, adsorption energy, and electronic structure of LaNiO3(001)/H2 systems were calculated and indicated through the calculated surface energy that the (001) surface was the most stable surface. By looking at optimized structure, adsorption energy and dissociation energy, we found that there were three types of adsorption on the surface. First, H2 molecules completely dissociate and then tend to bind with the O atoms, forming two –OH bonds. Second, H2 molecules partially dissociate with the H atoms bonding to the same O atom to form one H2O molecule. These two types are chemical adsorption modes; however, the physical adsorption of H2 molecules can also occur. When analyzing the electron structure of the H2O molecule formed by the partial dissociation of the H2 molecule and the surface O atom, we found that the interaction between H2O and the (001) surface was weaker, thus, H2O was easier to separate from the surface to create an O vacancy. On the (001) surface, a supercell was constructed to accurately study the most stable adsorption site. The results from analyses of the charge population; electron localization function; and density of the states indicated that the dissociated H and O atoms form a typical covalent bond and that the interaction between the H2 molecule and surface is mainly due to the overlap-hybridization among the H 1s, O 2s, and O 2p states. Therefore, the conductivity of LaNiO3(001)/H2 is stronger after adsorption and furthermore, the conductivity of the LaNiO3 surface is better than that of the LaFeO3 surface.},

ABSTRACT = {The hydrophilic property of cellulose is a key limiting factor for its wide application. Here, a novel solution impregnation pathway was developed to increase the hydrophobic properties of cellulose. When compared with the regenerated cellulose (RC), the composite films showed a decrease in water uptake ability towards water vapor, and an increase of the water contact angle from 29° to 65° with increasing resin content in the composites, with only a slight change in the transmittance. Furthermore, the Young’s modulus value increased from 3.2 GPa (RC film) to 5.1 GPa (RCBEA50 film). The results indicated that the composites had combined the advantages of cellulose and biphenyl A epoxy acrylate prepolymer (BEA) resin. The presented method has great potential for the preparation of biocomposites with improved properties. The overall results suggest that composite films can be used as high-performance packaging materials.},

ABSTRACT = {We present a dip-coatable, high-capacitance ion gel dielectric for scalable fabrication of three-dimensional (3D) electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) devices such as an n × n liquid prism array. Due to the formation of a nanometer-thick electric double layer (EDL) capacitor, an ion gel dielectric offers two to three orders higher specific capacitance (c ≈ 10 μF/cm2) than that of conventional dielectrics such as SiO2. However, the previous spin-coating method used for gel layer deposition poses several issues for 3D EWOD device fabrication, particularly when assembling multiple modules. Not only does the spin-coating process require multiple repetitions per module, but the ion gel layer also comes in risks of damage or contamination due to handling errors caused during assembly. In addition, it was observed that the chemical formulation previously used for the spin-coating method causes the surface defects on the dip-coated gel layers and thus leads to poor EWOD performance. In this paper, we alternatively propose a dip-coating method with modified gel solutions to obtain defect-free, functional ion gel layers without the issues arising from the spin-coating method for 3D device fabrication. A dip-coating approach offers a single-step coating solution with the benefits of simplicity, scalability, and high throughput for deposition of high-capacitance gel layers on non-planar EWOD devices. An ion gel solution was prepared by combining the [EMIM][TFSI] ionic liquid and the [P(VDF-HFP)] copolymer at various wt % ratios in acetone solvent. Experimental studies were conducted to fully understand the effects of chemical composition ratios in the gel solution and how varying thicknesses of ion gel and Teflon layers affects EWOD performance. The effectiveness and potentiality of dip-coatable gel layers for 3D EWOD devices have been demonstrated through fabricating 5 × 1 arrayed liquid prisms using a single-step dip-coating method. Each prism module has been individually controlled to achieve spatial beam steering without the need for bulky mechanical moving parts.},

ABSTRACT = {Metal nanoparticles (NPs) possess unique physicochemical attributes for creating effective recognition and transduction processes in chem/bio-sensing. In this work, we suggested that citrate-capped Au/Ag NPs could be used as the reporters for the design of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) sensors with a simple manipulation principle and an easy detection procedure. Specifically, p-benzenediboronic acid (BDBA) induced the aggregation of citrate-capped Au NPs through the cross-linking reaction between citrate and boronic acid of BDBA in solution. By modifying the electrode with a boronic acid derivative, the BDBA-induced assembly of Au NPs was achieved on the electrode surface. This led to a significant decrease in the electron transfer resistance due to the unique conductive ability of Au NPs. However, when the boronate group on the electrode surface was oxidized into its phenol format, the assembly of Au NPs on the electrode surface was not achieved. As a result, a higher electron transfer resistance was observed. The process could be monitored by electrochemical impedance technique. Furthermore, when Ag NPs were used instead of Au NPs in this design, the H2O2 concentration could be determined by measuring the linear-sweep voltammetry (LSV) current through the solid-state Ag/AgCl reaction of Ag NPs. The results indicated that NP-based colorimetric assays could be developed into more sensitive electrochemical analysis.},

ABSTRACT = {Bismuth (Bi) electrodeposition was studied on Si/Ti/Au, FTO-, and ITO-coated glasses from acidic nitrate solutions with and without gluconate within a narrow potential window (ΔE = 80 mV). This potential range was sufficient to observe a change in particle shape, from polyhedrons (including hexagons) to dendrites, the trend being slightly different depending on substrate activity. In all cases, though, the formation of dendrites was favoured as the applied potential was made more negative. Bi particles were more uniformly distributed over the substrate when sodium gluconate was added to the electrolyte. X-ray diffraction analyses of dendrites grown at −0.28 V indicated that they exhibit the rhombohedral phase of Bi and are predominantly oriented along the (003) plane. This orientation is exacerbated at the lowest applied potential (−0.20 V vs. Ag|AgCl) on glass/ITO substrate, for which completed and truncated hexagons are observed from the top view scanning electron microscopy images.},

ABSTRACT = {This study reported on the feasibility and practicability of Cr(NO3)3 hydrolysis to isolate cellulose nanocrystals (CNCCr(NO3)3) from native cellulosic feedstock. The physicochemical properties of CNCCr(NO3)3 were compared with nanocellulose isolated using sulfuric acid hydrolysis (CNCH2SO4). In optimum hydrolysis conditions, 80 °C, 1.5 h, 0.8 M Cr(NO3)3 metal salt and solid–liquid ratio of 1:30, the CNCCr(NO3)3 exhibited a network-like long fibrous structure with the aspect ratio of 15.7, while the CNCH2SO4 showed rice-shape structure with an aspect ratio of 3.5. Additionally, Cr(NO3)3-treated CNC rendered a higher crystallinity (86.5% ± 0.3%) with high yield (83.6% ± 0.6%) as compared to the H2SO4-treated CNC (81.4% ± 0.1% and 54.7% ± 0.3%, respectively). Furthermore, better thermal stability of CNCCr(NO3)3 (344 °C) compared to CNCH2SO4 (273 °C) rendered a high potential for nanocomposite application. This comparable effectiveness of Cr(NO3)3 metal salt provides milder hydrolysis conditions for highly selective depolymerization of cellulosic fiber into value-added cellulose nanomaterial, or useful chemicals and fuels in the future.},

ABSTRACT = {The article presents a proposal of a model of fatigue destruction of hydrophobised ceramic brick, i.e., a basic masonry material. The brick surface was hydrophobised with two inorganic polymers: a nanopolymer preparation based on dialkyl siloxanes (series 1–5) and an aqueous silicon solution (series 6–10). Nanosilica was added to the polymers to enhance the stability of the film formed on the brick surface. To achieve an appropriate blend of the polymer liquid phase and the nano silica solid phase, the mixture was disintegrated by sonication. The effect of the addition of nano silica and sonication on changes in the rheological parameters, i.e., viscosity and surface tension, was determined. Material fatigue was induced by cyclic immersion of the samples in water and drying at a temperature of 100 °C, which caused rapid and relatively dynamic movement of water. The moisture and temperature effect was determined by measurement of changes in surface hardness performed with the Vickers method and assessment of sample absorbability. The results provided an approximate picture of fatigue destruction of brick and hydrophobic coatings in relation to changes in their temporal stability. Additionally, SEM images of hydrophobic coatings in are shown.},

ABSTRACT = {Alkaline solutions, such as sodium, potassium or lithium silicates, appear to be very promising as healing agents for the development of encapsulated self-healing concretes. However, the evolution of their mechanical and acoustic properties in time has not yet been completely clarified, especially regarding their behavior and related kinetics when they are used in the form of a thin layer in contact with a hardened cement matrix. This study aims to monitor, using linear and nonlinear ultrasonic methods, the evolution of a sodium silicate solution interacting with a cement matrix in the presence of localized cracks. The ultrasonic inspection via linear methods revealed that an almost complete recovery of the elastic and acoustic properties occurred within a few days of healing. The nonlinear ultrasonic measurements contributed to provide further insight into the kinetics of the recovery due to the presence of the healing agent. A good regain of mechanical performance was ascertained through flexural tests at the end of the healing process, confirming the suitability of sodium silicate as a healing agent for self-healing cementitious systems.},

ABSTRACT = {In the advanced research fields of solar cell and energy storing materials, graphene and graphene oxide (GO) are two of the most promising materials due to their high specific surface area, and excellent electrical and physical properties. However, they was seldom studied in the traditional materials because of their high cost. Nowadays, graphene and GO are much cheaper than before with the development of production technologies, which provides the possibility of using these extraordinary materials in the traditional construction industry. In this paper, GO was selected as a nano-material to modify two different asphalts. Then a thin film oven test and a pressure aging vessel test were applied to simulate the aging of GO-modified asphalts. After thermal aging, basic physical properties (softening point and penetration) were tested for the samples which were introduced at different mass ratios of GO (1% and 3%) to asphalt. In addition, rheological properties were tested to investigate how GO could influence the asphalts by dynamic shearing rheometer tests. Finally, some interesting findings and potential utilization (warm mixing and flame retardants) of GO in asphalt pavement construction were explained.},

ABSTRACT = {The antifungal, antibacterial, and antioxidant activity of four commercial essential oils (EOs) (thyme, clove, rosemary, and tea tree) from Romanian production were studied in order to assess them as bioactive compounds for active food packaging applications. The chemical composition of the oils was determined with the Folin–Ciocâlteu method and gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry and flame ionization detectors, and it was found that they respect the AFNOR/ISO standard limits. The EOs were tested against three food spoilage fungi—Fusarium graminearum, Penicillium corylophilum, and Aspergillus brasiliensis—and three potential pathogenic food bacteria—Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Listeria monocytogenes—using the disc diffusion method. It was found that the EOs of thyme, clove, and tea tree can be used as antimicrobial agents against the tested fungi and bacteria, thyme having the highest inhibitory effect. Concerning antioxidant activity determined by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2’-azino-bis 3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) methods, it has been established that the clove oil exhibits the highest activity because of its high phenolic content. Promising results were obtained by their incorporation into chitosan emulsions and films, which show potential for food packaging. Therefore, these essential oils could be suitable alternatives to chemical additives, satisfying the consumer demand for naturally preserved food products ensuring its safety.},

ABSTRACT = {Concrete is prone to crack formation in the tensile zone, which is why steel reinforcement is introduced in these zones. However, small cracks could still arise, which give liquids and gasses access to the reinforcement causing it to corrode. Self-healing concrete repairs and seals these small (300 µm) cracks, preventing the development of corrosion. In this study, a vascular system, carrying the healing agent, is developed. It consists of tubes connected to a 3D printed distribution piece. This distribution piece has four outlets that are connected to the tubes and has one inlet, which is accessible from outside. Several materials were considered for the tubes, i.e., polymethylmethacrylate, starch, inorganic phosphate cement and alumina. Three-point-bending and four-point-bending tests proved that self-healing and multiple self-healing is possible with this developed vascular system.},

ABSTRACT = {Printing technologies for thin-film transistors (TFTs) have recently attracted much interest owing to their eco-friendliness, direct patterning, low cost, and roll-to-roll manufacturing processes. Lower production costs could result if electrodes fabricated by vacuum processes could be replaced by inkjet printing. However, poor interfacial contacts and/or serious diffusion between the active layer and the silver electrodes are still problematic for achieving amorphous indium–gallium–zinc–oxide (a-IGZO) TFTs with good electrical performance. In this paper, silver (Ag) source/drain electrodes were directly inkjet-printed on an amorphous a-IGZO layer to fabricate TFTs that exhibited a mobility of 0.29 cm2·V−1·s−1 and an on/off current ratio of over 105. To the best of our knowledge, this is a major improvement for bottom-gate top-contact a-IGZO TFTs with directly printed silver electrodes on a substrate with no pretreatment. This study presents a promising alternative method of fabricating electrodes of a-IGZO TFTs with desirable device performance.},

ABSTRACT = {The biomaterials used to maintain or replace functions in the human body consist mainly of metals, ceramics or polymers. In orthopedic surgery, metallic materials, especially titanium and its alloys, are the most common, due to their excellent mechanical properties, corrosion resistance, and biocompatibility. Aside from the established Ti6Al4V alloy, shape memory materials such as nickel-titanium (NiTi) have risen in importance, but are also discussed because of the adverse effects of nickel ions. These might be reduced by specific surface modifications. In the present in vitro study, the osteoblastic cell line MG-63 as well as primary human osteoblasts, fibroblasts, and macrophages were cultured on titanium alloys (forged Ti6Al4V, additive manufactured Ti6Al4V, NiTi, and Diamond-Like-Carbon (DLC)-coated NiTi) to verify their specific biocompatibility and inflammatory potential. Additive manufactured Ti6Al4V and NiTi revealed the highest levels of metabolic cell activity. DLC-coated NiTi appeared as a suitable surface for cell growth, showing the highest collagen production. None of the implant materials caused a strong inflammatory response. In general, no distinct cell-specific response could be observed for the materials and surface coating used. In summary, all tested titanium alloys seem to be biologically appropriate for application in orthopedic surgery.},

ABSTRACT = {Thermochromic films based on vanadium dioxide (VO2)/ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer (EVA) composite were developed. The monoclinic VO2 particles was firstly prepared via hydrothermal and calcination processes. The effects of hydrothermal time and tungsten doping agent on crystal structure and morphology of the calcined metal oxides were reported. After that, 1 wt % of the prepared VO2 powder was mixed with EVA compound, using two different mixing processes. It was found that mechanical properties of the EVA/VO2 films prepared by the melt process were superior to those of which prepared by the solution process. On the other hand, percentage visible light transmittance of the solution casted EVA/VO2 film was greater than that of the melt processed composite film. This was related to the different gel content of EVA rubber and state of dispersion and distribution of VO2 within the polymer matrix phase. Thermochromic behaviors and heat reflectance of the EVA/VO2 film were also verified. In overall, this study demonstrated that it was possible to develop a thermochromic film using the polymer composite approach. In this regard, the mixing condition was found to be one of the most important factors affecting morphology and thermo-mechanical properties of the films.},

ABSTRACT = {Magnesium alloys are promising candidates for biodegradable medical implants which reduce the necessity of second surgery to remove the implants. Yttrium in solid solution is an attractive alloying element because it improves mechanical properties and exhibits suitable corrosion properties. Silver was shown to have an antibacterial effect and can also enhance the mechanical properties of magnesium alloys. Measurements of microhardness and electrical resistivity were used to study the response of Mg–4Y and Mg–4Y–1Ag alloys to isochronal or isothermal heat treatments. Hardening response and electrical resistivity annealing curves in these alloys were compared in order to investigate the effect of silver addition. Procedures for solid solution annealing and artificial aging of the Mg–4Y–1Ag alloy were developed. The corrosion rate of the as-cast and heat-treated Mg–4Y–1Ag alloy was measured by the mass loss method. It was found out that solid solution heat treatment, as well artificial aging to peak hardness, lead to substantial improvement in the corrosion properties of the Mg–4Y–1Ag alloy.},

ABSTRACT = {High temperature surface acoustic wave sensors based on radio frequency identification technology require adequate antennas of high efficiency and thermal stability for the signal transmission. Platinum is well known and frequently used as a material of choice for high temperature and harsh environment applications because of the high melting point and its chemical stability. Therefore, one way to realize high temperature stable antennas is the combination of a Pt metallization on an Al 2 O 3 substrate. As a cost-effective technique, the Pt film is deposited via electrochemical deposition. For this growth procedure, a pre-deposited metallization on the Al 2 O 3 layer is required. This paper analyzes the influence of various seed layers (Ta, Ti, W, Cr, Pt) on the morphology, stability and electrical properties of the electrochemically-grown Pt thick film after heat treatments up to 1000 ∘ C in air. We find an oxidation of all adhesion layers except for Pt, for which the best electrical properties were measured. Although significant areas of the films delaminate from the substrate, individual anchor structures retain a stable connection between the Pt layer and the rough Al 2 O 3 substrate.},

ABSTRACT = {Metal additive manufacturing has strongly gained scientific and industrial importance during the last decades due to the geometrical flexibility and increased reliability of parts, as well as reduced equipment costs. Within the field of metal additive manufacturing methods, selective laser melting (SLM) is an eligible technique for the production of fully dense bulk material with complex geometry. In the current study, we addressed the application of SLM for processing a high-manganese TRansformation-/TWinning-Induced Plasticity (TRIP/TWIP) steel. The solidification behavior was analyzed by careful characterization of the as-built microstructure and element distribution using optical and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). In addition, the deformation behavior was studied using uniaxial tensile testing and SEM. Comparison with conventionally produced TRIP/TWIP steel revealed that elemental segregation, which is normally very pronounced in high-manganese steels and requires energy-intensive post processing, is reduced due to the high cooling rates during SLM. Also, the very fast cooling promoted ε- and α’-martensite formation prior to deformation. The superior strength and pronounced anisotropy of the SLM-produced material was correlated with the microstructure based on the process-specific characteristics.},

ABSTRACT = {(Ti,Zr)C powder was sintered with WC-Co following an industrial process, including an isotherm at 1410 °C. A series of interrupted sintering trials was performed with the aim of studying the sintering behavior and the microstructural evolution during both solid-state and liquid-state sintering. Reference samples, using the same elemental compositions but with the starting components TiC and ZrC instead of (Ti,Zr)C, were also sintered. The microstructure was investigated using scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. It is found that the (Ti,Zr)C phase decomposes into Ti-rich and Zr-rich nano-scale lamellae before the liquid-state of the sintering initiates. The final microstructure consists of the binder and WC as well as two different γ phases, rich in either Ti (γ1) or Zr (γ2). The γ2 phase grains have a core-shell structure with a (Ti,Zr)C core following the full sintering cycle. The major differences observed in (Ti,Zr)C with respect to the reference samples after the full sintering cycle were the referred core-shell structure and the carbide grain sizes; additionally, the microstructural evolution during sintering differs. The grain size of carbides (WC, γ1, and γ2) is about 10% smaller in WC-(Ti,Zr)C-Co than WC-TiC-ZrC-Co. The shrinkage behavior and hardness of both composites are reported and discussed.},

ABSTRACT = {Spin-crossover (SCO) triazole-based coordination polymers can be synthesized by micelle techniques, which almost always lead to rod-shaped nanoparticles. In order to notably reach new morphologies, we explore here the potentiality of the spray-drying (SD) method to get SCO materials. Three SCO coordination polymers and a mononuclear complex are investigated. In all cases, the SD method obtains particles definitely showing SCO. The features of the latter are yet always different from those of the referenced materials, in the sense that SCO is more gradual and incomplete, in adequacy with the poor crystallinity of the powders obtained by SD. In the case of coordination polymers, the particles are preferentially spherical. Indications of possible polymorphism and/or new materials induced by the use of the SD method are evidenced. In the case of the mononuclear complex, the SD method has allowed reproducing, in a quick and easy way, the well-known bulk compound. This exploratory work demonstrates the relevance of the concept and opens the way to a systematic scrutiny of all the experimental parameters to tune the size, morphology, and properties of the SD-synthesized SCO particles.},

ABSTRACT = {Graphene oxide nanosheets (GONs)/carboxymethyl chitosan (CMC)/Fe3O4 magnetic composite microspheres (MCMs) were prepared by enclosing Fe3O4 particles with CMC and GONs in turn. The microstructures of GONs and GONs/CMC/Fe3O4 MCMs were characterized by FTIR, XRD, TEM, and SEM. The effects of GON content, pH value, and adsorption time on the adsorption capacity of the MCMs were investigated. The results show that the GONs/CMC/Fe3O4 MCMs have a greater specific surface area and a strong adsorption capacity for dye wastewater. Meanwhile, the adsorption mechanism was investigated, and the results accorded with the pseudo-second-order kinetic model and the Freundlich isotherm model. The search results indicate that GONs/CMC/Fe3O4 MCMs can be used to purify dye wastewater and has an important potential use in the practical purification of dye wastewater.},

ABSTRACT = {In cement-based pastes, the relationship between the complex phase assemblage and mechanical properties is usually described by the “gel/space ratio” descriptor. The gel/space ratio is defined as the volume ratio of the gel to the available space in the composite system, and it has been widely studied in the cement unary system. This work determines the gel/space ratio in the cement-silica fume-fly ash ternary system (C-SF-FA system) by measuring the reaction degrees of the cement, SF, and FA. The effects that the supplementary cementitious material (SCM) replacements exert on the evolution of the gel/space ratio are discussed both theoretically and practically. The relationship between the gel/space ratio and compressive strength is then explored, and the relationship disparities for different mix proportions are analyzed in detail. The results demonstrate that the SCM replacements promote the gel/space ratio evolution only when the SCM reaction degree is higher than a certain value, which is calculated and defined as the critical reaction degree (CRD). The effects of the SCM replacements can be predicted based on the CRD, and the theological predictions agree with the test results quite well. At low gel/space ratios, disparities in the relationship between the gel/space ratio and the compressive strength are caused by porosity, which has also been studied in cement unary systems. The ratio of cement-produced gel to SCM-produced gel ( G C to G S C M ratio) is introduced for use in analyzing high gel/space ratios, in which it plays a major role in creating relationship disparities.},

ABSTRACT = {Creep tests of the polycrystalline nickel alloy Waspaloy have been conducted at Swansea University, for varying stress conditions at 700 °C. Investigation through use of Transmission Electron Microscopy at Cambridge University has examined the dislocation networks formed under these conditions, with particular attention paid to comparing tests performed above and below the yield stress. This paper highlights how the dislocation structures vary throughout creep and proposes a dislocation mechanism theory for creep in Waspaloy. Activation energies are calculated through approaches developed in the use of the recently formulated Wilshire Equations, and are found to differ above and below the yield stress. Low activation energies are found to be related to dislocation interaction with γ′ precipitates below the yield stress. However, significantly increased dislocation densities at stresses above yield cause an increase in the activation energy values as forest hardening becomes the primary mechanism controlling dislocation movement. It is proposed that the activation energy change is related to the stress increment provided by work hardening, as can be observed from Ti, Ni and steel results.},

ABSTRACT = {Stem-cell-based therapies require a high number (106–109) of cells, therefore in vitro expansion is needed because of the initially low amount of stem cells obtainable from human tissues. Standard protocols for stem cell expansion are currently based on chemically-defined culture media and animal-derived feeder-cell layers, which expose cells to additives and to xenogeneic compounds, resulting in potential issues when used in clinics. The two-photon laser polymerization technique enables three-dimensional micro-structures to be fabricated, which we named synthetic nichoids. Here we review our activity on the technological improvements in manufacturing biomimetic synthetic nichoids and, in particular on the optimization of the laser-material interaction to increase the patterned area and the percentage of cell culture surface covered by such synthetic nichoids, from a low initial value of 10% up to 88% with an optimized micromachining time. These results establish two-photon laser polymerization as a promising tool to fabricate substrates for stem cell expansion, without any chemical supplement and in feeder-free conditions for potential therapeutic uses.},

ABSTRACT = {In this study, we manufacture and analyze bioactive magnesium–calcium silicate/poly-ε-caprolactone (Mg–CS/PCL) 3D scaffolds for bone tissue engineering. Mg–CS powder was incorporated into PCL, and we fabricated the 3D scaffolds using laser sintering technology. These scaffolds had high porosity and interconnected-design macropores and structures. As compared to pure PCL scaffolds without an Mg–CS powder, the hydrophilic properties and degradation rate are also improved. For scaffolds with more than 20% Mg–CS content, the specimens become completely covered by a dense bone-like apatite layer after soaking in simulated body fluid for 1 day. In vitro analyses were directed using human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) on all scaffolds that were shown to be biocompatible and supported cell adhesion and proliferation. Increased focal adhesion kinase and promoted cell adhesion behavior were observed after an increase in Mg–CS content. In addition, the results indicate that the Mg–CS quantity in the composite is higher than 10%, and the quantity of cells and osteogenesis-related protein of hMSCs is stimulated by the Si ions released from the Mg–CS/PCL scaffolds when compared to PCL scaffolds. Our results proved that 3D Mg–CS/PCL scaffolds with such a specific ionic release and good degradability possessed the ability to promote osteogenetic differentiation of hMSCs, indicating that they might be promising biomaterials with potential for next-generation bone tissue engineering scaffolds.},

ABSTRACT = {Digital light processing (DLP) is an accurate additive manufacturing (AM) technology suitable for producing micro-parts by photopolymerization. As most AM technologies, anisotropy of parts made by DLP is a key issue to deal with, taking into account that several operational factors modify this characteristic. Design for this technology and photopolymers becomes a challenge because the manufacturing process and post-processing strongly influence the mechanical properties of the part. This paper shows experimental work to demonstrate the particular behavior of parts made using DLP. Being different to any other AM technology, rules for design need to be adapted. Influence of build direction and post-curing process on final mechanical properties and anisotropy are reported and justified based on experimental data and theoretical simulation of bi-material parts formed by fully-cured resin and partially-cured resin. Three photopolymers were tested under different working conditions, concluding that post-curing can, in some cases, correct the anisotropy, mainly depending on the nature of photopolymer.},

ABSTRACT = {This study investigated the impact of different light curing units (LCUs) for the polymerization of adhesive system visio.link (VL) on the tensile bond strength (TBS) of different PEEK compositions. For TBS measurements, 216 PEEK specimens with varying amounts of TiO2 (PEEK/0%, PEEK/20%, PEEK/>30%) were embedded, polished, air abraded (Al2O3, 50 µm, 0.4 MPa), conditioned using VL, and polymerized using either a halogen LCU (HAL-LCU) or a LED LCU (LED-LCU) for chairside or labside application, respectively. After thermocycling (5000×, 5/55 °C), TBS was measured, and fracture types were determined. Data was analyzed using a 2-way ANOVA followed by Tukey–HSD, Kruskal–Wallis H and Mann–Whitney U tests as well as a Chi2-test and a Ciba–Geigy table (p < 0.05). Globally, the light curing units, followed by PEEK composition, was shown to have the highest impact on TBS. The HAL-LCUs, compared to the LED-LCUs, resulted in a higher TBS for all PEEK compositions—without significant differences between chairside and labside units. Regarding the different PEEK compositions, PEEK/20%, compared to PEEK/0%, resulted in a higher TBS when both, HAL-LCUs or LED-LCUs were used for labside application. In comparison with PEEK/>30%, PEEK/20% resulted in a higher TBS after using HAL-LCU for labside application. No significant differences were found between PEEK/0% and PEEK/>30%. HAL-LCU with PEEK/20% for labside application showed a higher TBS than HAL-LCU with PEEK/20% for chairside application, whereas LED-LCU with PEEK/>30% for chairside application showed a higher TBS than LED-LCU with PEEK/>30% for labside application.},

ABSTRACT = {Nanofibers with excellent activities in surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) were developed through electrospinning precursor suspensions consisting of polyacrylonitrile (PAN), silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), silicon nanoparticles (SiNPs), and cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs). Rheology of the precursor suspensions, and morphology, thermal properties, chemical structures, and SERS sensitivity of the nanofibers were investigated. The electrospun nanofibers showed uniform diameters with a smooth surface. Hydrofluoric (HF) acid treatment of the PAN/CNC/Ag composite nanofibers (defined as p-PAN/CNC/Ag) led to rougher fiber surfaces with certain pores and increased mean fiber diameters. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results confirmed the existence of AgNPs that were formed during heat and HF acid treatment processes. In addition, thermal stability of the electrospun nanofibers increased due to the incorporation of CNCs and AgNPs. The p-PAN/CNC/Ag nanofibers were used as a SERS substrate to detect p-aminothiophenol (p-ATP) probe molecule. The results show that this substrate exhibited high sensitivity for the p-ATP probe detection.},

ABSTRACT = {In order to develop a film electrode for the surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices working in high temperature, harsh environments, novel AlN/Pt/ZnO multilayers were prepared using pulsed laser deposition (PLD) systems on langasite (LGS) substrates. The AlN film was used as a protective layer and the ZnO buffer layer was introduced to improve the crystal quality of Pt films. The results show that the resistances of Pt and AlN/Pt film electrodes violently increase above 600 °C and 800 °C, respectively, while the resistances of AlN/Pt/ZnO electrodes have more stable electrical resistance from room temperature to 1000 °C. The AlN/Pt/ZnO electrode, where the ZnO film was deposited at 600 °C, has the best temperature stability and can steadily work for 4 h at 1000 °C. The mechanism underlying the stable resistance of the AlN/Pt/ZnO electrode at a high temperature was investigated by analyzing the microstructure of the prepared samples. The proposed AlN/Pt/ZnO film electrode has great potential for applications in high temperature SAW sensors.},

Additionally, scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction spectroscopy were used to analyze the dispersion, location, and phase morphology of TiO2 on the HDPE matrix. Mechanical tests revealed that tensile strength of the fabricated HDPE-TiO2 nanocomposites ranged between 22.53 and 26.30 MPa, while the Young’s modulus showed a consistent increase as the barrel temperature increased from 150 °C to 300 °C. Moreover, the thermal stability decreased as the barrel temperature increased.},

Monolayer graphene grown on copper by the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process was transferred by the pressing method over the target substrates, followed by wet etching of copper to obtain monolayer graphene/polymer membranes. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and contact angle (CA) measurements were carried out to explore the graphene layer transferability. Three factors, namely, the substrate roughness, its pore size, and its surface wetting (degree of hydrophobicity) are found to affect the conformality and coverage of the transferred graphene monolayer on the substrate surface. A good quality graphene transfer is achieved on the substrate with the following characteristics; being hydrophobic (CA > 90°), having small pore size, and low surface roughness, with a CA to RMS (root mean square) ratio higher than 2.7°/nm.},

ABSTRACT = {Aluminum single crystal with 99.999% purity was deformed at room temperature by equal channel angular pressing (ECAP) up to 16 passes. Grain size and misorientation of processed samples were quantitatively characterized by TEM and EBSD. The results show that the refinement efficiency of high purity aluminum single crystal was poor in the initial stage. Extrusion by fewer ECAP passes (n ≤ 8) resulted in only elongated grains containing a large number of subgrains and small misorientations between grains. Stable microstructures of nearly equiaxed grains with high misorientations were obtained by 15 passages, indicating that the initial extremely coarse grains and highly uniform grain orientation are not conducive to the accumulation of strain energy. The initial state of high purity aluminum has a significant effect on the refining efficiency of the ECAP process.},

ABSTRACT = {In order to study the influence of trap parameters on dielectric characteristics of nano-modified pressboards, pressboards were made using the nano doping method with different nanoparticle components. The dielectric characteristics of the modified pressboards were measured, and the trap parameters were investigated using the thermally stimulated current (TSC) method. The test results indicated that the conductivity initially declined and then rose with the increase of nano-Al2O3 content, whereas it solely rose with the increase of nano-SiC content. Moreover, the conductivity exhibited nonlinear characteristics with the enhancement of electric field stress at high nanoparticle content. The relative permittivity of modified pressboard declines initially and then rises with the increase of nanoparticle content. In addition, the breakdown strength of modified pressboards exhibited a pattern of incline followed by decline with the increase of nano-Al2O3 content, while it always declined with the increase of nano-SiC content. The analysis based on the energy band theory on trap parameters of the constructed multi-core model concludes that the nanoparticle components added in pressboard altered both the depth and density of traps. It is therefore concluded that trap parameters have significant influence on the dielectric characteristics of nano-modified insulation pressboard.},

ABSTRACT = {Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) is a biopolymer that is biodegradable, environmentally friendly, and bio-friendly. Owing to its unique chemical structure, HPMC can reduce the coefficient of friction (COF) and frictional wear and thus possesses excellent lubrication properties. HPMC has good dissolvability in specific solvents. The present research focuses on the reversible dissolution reaction subsequent to the film formation of HPMC, with a view to the healing and lubrication properties of thin films. Raman spectroscopy was used to test the film-forming properties of HPMC and the dissolution characteristics of various solvents. In this study, the solvents were water, methanol, ethanol, and acetone. The results showed that the HPMC film had the highest dissolvability in water. The ball-on-disk wear test was used to analyze the lubrication properties of HPMC, and the results showed that HPMC had the same COF and lubrication properties as the original film after being subjected to the water healing treatment. The HPMC film can be reused, recycled, and refilled, making it an ideal lubricant for next-generation ecotribology.},

ABSTRACT = {Objectives. The objectives of this study were to: (1) develop a bioactive multifunctional composite (BMC) via nanoparticles of amorphous calcium phosphate (NACP), 2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine (MPC), dimethylaminohexadecyl methacrylate (DMAHDM) and nanoparticles of silver (NAg); and (2) investigate the effects of combined BMC + poly (amido amine) (PAMAM) on remineralization of demineralized root dentin in a cyclic artificial saliva/lactic acid environment for the first time. Methods. Root dentin specimens were prepared and demineralized with 37% phosphoric acid for 15 s. Four groups were prepared: (1) root dentin control; (2) root dentin with BMC; (3) root dentin with PAMAM; (4) root dentin with BMC + PAMAM. Specimens were treated with a cyclic artificial saliva/lactic acid regimen for 21 days. Calcium (Ca) and phosphate (P) ion concentrations and acid neutralization were determined. The remineralized root dentin specimens were examined via hardness testing and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Results. Mechanical properties of BMC were similar to commercial control composites (p = 0.913). BMC had excellent Ca and P ion release and acid-neutralization capability. BMC or PAMAM alone each achieved slight mineral regeneration in demineralized root dentin. The combined BMC + PAMAM induced the greatest root dentin remineralization, and increased the hardness of pre-demineralized root dentin to match that of healthy root dentin (p = 0.521). Significance. The excellent root dentin remineralization effects of BMC + PAMAM were demonstrated for the first time. BMC + PAMAM induced effective and complete root dentin remineralization in an acid challenge environment. The novel BMC + PAMAM method is promising for Class V and other restorations to remineralize and protect tooth structures.},

ABSTRACT = {Laser sintered technology has been introduced for clinical use and can be utilized more widely, accompanied by the digitalization of dentistry and the development of direct oral scanning devices. This study was performed with the aim of comparing the marginal accuracy and internal fit of Co-Cr alloy copings fabricated by casting, CAD/CAM (Computer-aided design/Computer-assisted manufacture) milled, and 3-D laser sintered techniques. A total of 36 Co-Cr alloy crown-copings were fabricated from an implant abutment. The marginal and internal fit were evaluated by measuring the weight of the silicone material, the vertical marginal discrepancy using a microscope, and the internal gap in the sectioned specimens. The data were statistically analyzed by One-way ANOVA (analysis of variance), a Scheffe’s test, and Pearson’s correlation at the significance level of p = 0.05, using statistics software. The silicone weight was significantly low in the casting group. The 3-D laser sintered group showed the highest vertical discrepancy, and marginal-, occlusal-, and average- internal gaps (p < 0.05). The CAD/CAM milled group revealed a significantly high axial internal gap. There are moderate correlations between the vertical marginal discrepancy and the internal gap variables (r = 0.654), except for the silicone weight. In this study, the 3-D laser sintered group achieved clinically acceptable marginal accuracy and internal fit.},

ABSTRACT = {Doped calcium phosphate bioceramics are promising materials for bone repair surgery because of their chemical resemblance to the mineral constituent of bone. Among these materials, BCP samples composed of hydroxyapatite (Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2) and β-TCP (Ca3(PO4)2) present a mineral analogy with the nano-multi-substituted hydroxyapatite bio-mineral part of bones. At the same time, doping can be used to tune the biological properties of these ceramics. This paper presents a general overview of the doping mechanisms of BCP samples using cations from the first-row transition metals (from manganese to zinc), with respect to the applied sintering temperature. The results enable the preparation of doped synthetic BCP that can be used to tailor biological properties, in particular by tuning the release amounts upon interaction with biological fluids. Intermediate sintering temperatures stabilize the doping elements in the more soluble β-TCP phase, which favors quick and easy release upon integration in the biological environment, whereas higher sintering temperatures locate the doping elements in the weakly soluble HAp phase, enabling a slow and continuous supply of the bio-inspired properties. An interstitial doping mechanism in the HAp hexagonal channel is observed for the six investigated cations (Mn2+, Fe3+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+ and Zn2+) with specific characteristics involving a shift away from the center of the hexagonal channel (Fe3+, Co2+), cationic oxidation (Mn3+, Co3+), and also cationic reduction (Cu+). The complete crystallochemical study highlights a complex HAp doping mechanism, mainly realized by an interstitial process combined with calcium substitution for the larger cations of the series leading to potentially calcium deficient HAp.},

ABSTRACT = {Single-crystal Ni-base superalloys, consisting of a two-phase γ/ γ ′ microstructure, retain high strengths at elevated temperatures and are key materials for high temperature applications, like, e.g., turbine blades of aircraft engines. The lattice misfit between the γ and γ ′ phases results in internal stresses, which significantly influence the deformation and creep behavior of the material. Large-scale atomistic simulations that are often used to enhance our understanding of the deformation mechanisms in such materials must accurately account for such misfit stresses. In this work, we compare the internal stresses in both idealized and experimentally-informed, i.e., more realistic, γ/ γ ′ microstructures. The idealized samples are generated by assuming, as is frequently done, a periodic arrangement of cube-shaped γ ′ particles with planar γ/ γ ′ interfaces. The experimentally-informed samples are generated from two different sources to produce three different samples—the scanning electron microscopy micrograph-informed quasi-2D atomistic sample and atom probe tomography-informed stoichiometric and non-stoichiometric atomistic samples. Additionally, we compare the stress state of an idealized embedded cube microstructure with finite element simulations incorporating 3D periodic boundary conditions. Subsequently, we study the influence of the resulting stress state on the evolution of dislocation loops in the different samples. The results show that the stresses in the atomistic and finite element simulations are almost identical. Furthermore, quasi-2D boundary conditions lead to a significantly different stress state and, consequently, different evolution of the dislocation loop, when compared to samples with fully 3D boundary conditions.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper offers a detailed, quantitative and exhaustive experimental comparison in terms of mechanical properties of three different layouts of carbon composite materials (CFRP) used to strengthen existing old timber beams highly affected by diverse natural defects and biological attacks, testing the use of pultruded laminate attached on the tension side of the element (LR), CFRP fabrics totally U-shape wrapping the timber element (UR), and the combined use of both reinforcement solutions (UR-P). Moreover, unidirectional and bidirectional fabrics were considered and compared. Timber elements used for the experimental program were extracted from a recent rehabilitation of the roof of the current Faculty of Law building, University of Granada (Spain), catalogued as a historical edifice. Experimental results from bending tests show that in all cases reinforcement provides a clear improvement in terms of bending capacity and stiffness as compared with the control specimens (without reinforcement). However, improvements in terms of ductility differ considerably depending on the kind of layout.},

ABSTRACT = {This work describes the synthesis, characterization, and photocatalytic activity of new composite nanomaterials based on ZnO nanostructures impregnated by lipophlilic porphyrins derived from cashew nut shell liquid (CNSL). The obtained nanomaterials were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and steady-state photoluminescence spectra (PL). The results confirm nanostructures showing average diameter of 55 nm and an improved absorption in the visible region. Further, the FTIR analysis proved the existence of non-covalent interactions between the porphyrin molecules and ZnO. The photocatalytic activity of prepared photocatalysts was investigated by degradation of rhodamine B (RhB) in aqueous solution under visible light irradiation and natural sunlight. It was demonstrated that the photocatalytic activity increases in the presence of the porphyrins and, also, depends on the irradiation source. The development of composite photocatalysts based on porphyrins derived from CNSL provides an alternative approach to eliminate efficiently toxic wastes from water under ambient conditions.},

ABSTRACT = {The standard oxidation potential and the electron transfer (ET) rate constants of two silicon-based hybrid interfaces, Si(111)/organic-spacer/Ferrocene, are theoretically calculated and assessed. The dynamics of the electrochemical driven ET process is modeled in terms of the classical donor/acceptor scheme within the framework of “Marcus theory”. The ET rate constants, k E T , are determined following calculation of the electron transfer matrix element, V R P , together with the knowledge of the energy of the neutral and charge separated systems. The recently introduced Constrained Density Functional Theory (CDFT) method is exploited to optimize the structure and determine the energy of the charge separated species. Calculated ET rate constants are k E T = 77.8 s − 1 and k E T = 1.3 × 10 − 9 s − 1 , in the case of the short and long organic-spacer, respectively.},

ABSTRACT = {This study demonstrates the utility of the newly developed self-assembly-induced gelation technique for the synthesis of porous collagen/hydroxyapatite (HA) composite microspheres with a nanofibrous structure. This new approach can produce microspheres of a uniform size using the droplets that form at the nozzle tip before gelation. These microspheres can have a highly nanofibrous structure due to the immersion of the droplets in a coagulation bath (water/acetone), in which the collagen aggregates in the solution can self-assemble into fibrils due to pH-dependent precipitation. Bioactive HA particles were incorporated into the collagen solutions, in order to enhance the bioactivity of the composite microspheres. The composite microspheres exhibited a well-defined spherical morphology and a uniform size for all levels of HA content (0 wt %, 10 wt %, 15 wt %, and 20 wt %). Collagen nanofibers—several tens of nanometers in size—were uniformly present throughout the microspheres and the HA particles were also well dispersed. The in vitro apatite-forming ability, assessed using the simulated body fluid (SBF) solution, increased significantly with the incorporation of HA into the composite microspheres.},

The adsorption capacities of PPH and phenyl surface functionalized (Φ-PPH) were 0.0400 and 0.0967 mmol/g, respectively, with a dye concentration of 10−5 M when well fitted with SIPS and Langmuir isotherms respectively (pH 6.5, 25 °C). The incorporation of the dye to the adsorbent material was monitored by the S content of the dye. It is suggested as an alternative for Acid Blue 113 remediation.},

ABSTRACT = {ZnO/nitrogen-doped carbon nanotube (ZnO/NCNT) composite, prepared though a simple one-step sol-gel synthetic technique, has been explored for the first time as an anode material. The as-prepared ZnO/NCNT nanocomposite preserves a good dispersity and homogeneity of the ZnO nanoparticles (~6 nm) which deposited on the surface of NCNT. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) reveals the formation of ZnO nanoparticles with an average size of 6 nm homogeneously deposited on the surface of NCNT. ZnO/NCNT composite, when evaluated as an anode for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), exhibits remarkably enhanced cycling ability and rate capability compared with the ZnO/CNT counterpart. A relatively large reversible capacity of 1013 mAh·g−1 is manifested at the second cycle and a capacity of 664 mAh·g−1 is retained after 100 cycles. Furthermore, the ZnO/NCNT system displays a reversible capacity of 308 mAh·g−1 even at a high current density of 1600 mA·g−1. These electrochemical performance enhancements are ascribed to the reinforced accumulative effects of the well-dispersed ZnO nanoparticles and doping nitrogen atoms, which can not only suppress the volumetric expansion of ZnO nanoparticles during the cycling performance but also provide a highly conductive NCNT network for ZnO anode.},

Systematic electrochemical characterization showed that the multilayer graphene coating developed in the study provided significant corrosion resistance in a chloride solution and the corrosion resistance was sustained for long durations (~400 h), which is attributed to the multilayer graphene.},

The structures of the ligands and their complexes were characterized by means of FT-IR, UV-Vis and NMR spectrometry complemented with photoluminescence and cyclic voltammetry. The photophysical properties of 2-aryl-4-(4-fluorophenylvinyl)quinoline and its corresponding complex were also studied using the density functional theory method. The photoluminescent properties of the ligands and the corresponding complexes showed high fluorescent intensities and quantum yields in solvents of different polarities. The photoluminescence spectra of the complexes in solid film, showed common transmission curves at longer wavelengths maximum (λem = 697 nm) possibly originating from the interference of scattered light of higher-order transmission of monochromators.},

Effects of precipitants ((NH4)2C2O4·H2O and Na2CO3) and pH were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Zeta potential analyzer, thermogravimetry-differential scanning calorimetry (TG-DSC), inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Co-Cr-V alloy powders were consisted of major face-centered cubic Co (fcc Co) and minor hexagonal close-packed Co (hcp Co). Grain sizes of precursors and Co-Cr-V alloy powders were increased with pH value (7–10) within the ranges of 3~39 and 39~66 nm, respectively. Rod-like or granular Co-Cr-V alloy particles were assembled by interconnected nanograins. At pH = 7, Na2CO3 precipitant was found to be beneficial to maintain the desirable composition of Co-Cr-V powders. It was also found that lower pH favors the maintenance of pre-designed composition, while grain coarsens at higher pH. Effects of variation for precipitant and pH on the morphology and composition of Co-Cr-V alloy powder were discussed in detail and relevant mechanism was further proposed.},

ABSTRACT = {The kinematic behavior of models that are based on the finite element method (FEM) for modeling the human body depends greatly on an accurate estimate of the parameters that define such models. This task is complex, and any small difference between the actual biomaterial model and the simulation model based on FEM can be amplified enormously in the presence of nonlinearities. The current paper attempts to demonstrate how a combination of the FEM and the MRS methods with desirability functions can be used to obtain the material parameters that are most appropriate for use in defining the behavior of Finite Element (FE) models of the healthy human lumbar intervertebral disc (IVD). The FE model parameters were adjusted on the basis of experimental data from selected standard tests (compression, flexion, extension, shear, lateral bending, and torsion) and were developed as follows: First, three-dimensional parameterized FE models were generated on the basis of the mentioned standard tests. Then, 11 parameters were selected to define the proposed parameterized FE models. For each of the standard tests, regression models were generated using MRS to model the six stiffness and nine bulges of the healthy IVD models that were created by changing the parameters of the FE models. The optimal combination of the 11 parameters was based on three different adjustment criteria. The latter, in turn, were based on the combination of stiffness and bulges that were obtained from the standard test FE simulations. The first adjustment criteria considered stiffness and bulges to be equally important in the adjustment of FE model parameters. The second adjustment criteria considered stiffness as most important, whereas the third considered the bulges to be most important. The proposed adjustment methods were applied to a medium-sized human IVD that corresponded to the L3–L4 lumbar level with standard dimensions of width = 50 mm, depth = 35 mm, and height = 10 mm. Agreement between the kinematic behavior that was obtained with the optimized parameters and that obtained from the literature demonstrated that the proposed method is a powerful tool with which to adjust healthy IVD FE models when there are many parameters, stiffnesses, and bulges to which the models must adjust.},

ABSTRACT = {The resulting properties of parts fabricated by powder bed fusion additive manufacturing processes are determined by their porosity, local composition, and microstructure. The objective of this work is to examine the influence of the stochastic powder bed on the process window for dense parts by means of numerical simulation. The investigations demonstrate the unique capability of simulating macroscopic domains in the range of millimeters with a mesoscopic approach, which resolves the powder bed and the hydrodynamics of the melt pool. A simulated process window reveals the influence of the stochastic powder layer. The numerical results are verified with an experimental process window for selective electron beam-melted Ti-6Al-4V. Furthermore, the influence of the powder bulk density is investigated numerically. The simulations predict an increase in porosity and surface roughness for samples produced with lower powder bulk densities. Due to its higher probability for unfavorable powder arrangements, the process stability is also decreased. This shrinks the actual parameter range in a process window for producing dense parts.},

ABSTRACT = {In this work, an electrophoretic deposition (EPD) technique has been used for deposition of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) on the surface of glass fiber textures (GTs) to increase the volume conductivity and the interlaminar shear strength (ILSS) of CNT/glass fiber-reinforced polymers (GFRPs) composites. Comprehensive experimental studies have been conducted to establish the influence of electric field strength, CNT concentration in EPD suspension, surface quality of GTs, and process duration on the quality of deposited CNT layers. CNT deposition increased remarkably when the surface of glass fibers was treated with coupling agents. Deposition of CNTs was optimized by measuring CNT’s deposition mass and process current density diagrams. The effect of optimum field strength on CNT deposition mass is around 8.5 times, and the effect of optimum suspension concentration on deposition rate is around 5.5 times. In the optimum experimental setting, the current density values of EPD were bounded between 0.5 and 1 mA/cm2. Based on the cumulative deposition diagram, it was found that the first three minutes of EPD is the effective deposition time. Applying optimized EPD in composite fabrication of treated GTs caused a drastic improvement on the order of 108 times in the volume conductivity of the nanocomposite laminate in comparison with simple GTs specimens. Optimized CNT deposition also enhanced the ILSS of hierarchical nanocomposites by 42%.},

ABSTRACT = {In this work, oxygen vacancies were introduced onto the surface of BiFeO3 nanoparticles by NaBH4 reduction method to yield oxygen-deficient BiFeO3−x samples. Comprehensive analysis on the basis of high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) observation and X-ray photoelectron spectrum (XPS) confirms the existence of surface oxygen vacancies on the BiFeO3−x nanoparticles. The photocatalytic activity of as-prepared BiFeO3−x samples was evaluated by the decolorization of rhodamine B (RhB) under simulated sunlight irradiation. The experimental results indicate that the photocatalytic activity of samples is highly related to the NaBH4 reduction time, and the BiFeO3−x sample reduced for 40 min exhibits the highest photocatalytic efficiency, which is much higher than that of pristine BiFeO3 nanoparticles. This can be explained by the fact that the surface oxygen vacancies act as photoinduced charges acceptors and adsorption sites suppress the recombination of photogenerated charges, leading to an increasing availability of photogenerated electrons and holes for photocatalytic reaction. In addition, the obtained BiFeO3−x sample exhibits good photocatalytic reusability.},

ABSTRACT = {Biochar is an eco-friendly, renewable, and cost-effective material that can be used as an adsorbent for the remediation of contaminated environments. In this paper, two types of biochar were prepared through corn straw and poplar leaf pyrolysis at 300 °C and 700 °C (C300, C700, P300, P700). Brunaer–Emmett–Teller N2 surface area, scanning electron microscope, elemental analysis, and infrared spectra were used to characterize their structures. These biochars were then used as adsorbents for the adsorption of dodecylbenzene sulfonic acid (DBSA). The microscopic adsorption mechanisms were studied by using infrared spectra, 13C-nuclear magnetic resonance spectra, and electron spin resonance spectra. The surface area and pore volume of C700 (375.89 m2/g and 0.2302 cm3/g) were the highest among all samples. Elemental analysis results showed that corn straw biochars had a higher aromaticity and carbon to nitrogen (C/N) ratio than the poplar leaf biochars. High temperature caused the increase of carbon content and the decrease of oxygen content, which also gave the biochars a higher adsorption rate. Pseudo-second order kinetic provided a better fit with the experimental data. Adsorption isotherm experiments showed that the adsorption isotherm of C300 fit the linear model. For other biochars, the adsorption isotherms fitted Langmuir model. Biochars with high temperatures exhibited enhanced adsorption capacity compared with ones at low temperatures. The qmax values of biochars to DBSA followed the order of P700 > C700 > P300. The adsorption mechanisms were complex, including partition, anion exchange, the formation of H bonds, covalent bonds, and charge transfer. The adsorption by covalent bonding might be the key mechanism determining the adsorption capacity of P700.},

ABSTRACT = {As one of the powder bed fusion additive manufacturing technologies, electron beam melting (EBM) is gaining more and more attention due to its near-net-shape production capacity with low residual stress and good mechanical properties. These characteristics also allow EBM built parts to be used as produced without post-processing. However, the as-built rough surface introduces a detrimental influence on the mechanical properties of metallic alloys. Thereafter, understanding the effects of processing parameters on the part’s surface roughness, in turn, becomes critical. This paper has focused on varying the processing parameters of two types of contouring scanning strategies namely, multispot and non-multispot, in EBM. The results suggest that the beam current and speed function are the most significant processing parameters for non-multispot contouring scanning strategy. While for multispot contouring scanning strategy, the number of spots, spot time, and spot overlap have greater effects than focus offset and beam current. The improved surface roughness has been obtained in both contouring scanning strategies. Furthermore, non-multispot contouring scanning strategy gives a lower surface roughness value and poorer geometrical accuracy than the multispot counterpart under the optimized conditions. These findings could be used as a guideline for selecting the contouring type used for specific industrial parts that are built using EBM.},
