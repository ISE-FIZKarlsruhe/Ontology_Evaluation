ABSTRACT = {Wind power plants are considered as an ecologically-clean source of energy. However, manufacturing processes cannot be treated that way. Manufacturing processes consume huge amounts of electrical and thermal energy and significant amount of materials, e.g., steel, polymers, oils, and lubricants. All of the above could be potentially harmful for environment. There are not many works and publications regarding life-cycle analysis of wind power plants. This study’s objective is to use LCA (Life Cycle Assessment) to the manufacturing and utilization of a specific drag force-driven wind turbine. The discussed innovative wind turbine is of the type that assures safety for prosumer application. Drag force-driven turbines become more heavy than other types of lift driven turbines, but at the same time, their characteristic provides opportunity to use easily recyclable materials instead of materials like plastics or composites. The wider look through LCA tools, may change the perspective of view at that type of wind turbines. Analyzed turbine has capacity of 15 kW and is located in Poland. LCA was carried out using Eco-indicator 99 method in eleven impact categories. Among all of the turbine components, the highest negative impact was noted in the case of the tower. The wind turbine under consideration is characterized by high recycling potential. According to the presented research, recycling provides around 30% reduction of the environmental impact.},

ABSTRACT = {We evaluated the effect of osteoporotic induction after eight weeks of initial healing of bone defects grafted with a xenograft material in a rat model. Bone defects were created in the femoral condyles of 16 female Wistar rats (one defect per rat). The defects were filled with bovine bone (Inter-Oss) granules. After eight weeks of bone healing, rats were randomly ovariectomized (OVX) or sham-operated (SHAM). At 14 weeks of bone healing, all animals were euthanized. Bone specimens were harvested and processed for histological and histomorphometric analyses to assess new bone formation (N-BF%), remaining bone graft (RBG%) and trabecular bone space (Tb.Sp%) within the defect area. After 14 weeks of bone healing, histological evaluation revealed a significant alteration in trabecular bone in OVX rats compared to SHAM rats. There was lower N-BF% in OVX rats (22.5% ± 3.0%) compared to SHAM rats (37.7% ± 7.9%; p < 0.05). Additionally, the RBG% was significantly lower in OVX (23.7% ± 5.8%) compared to SHAM (34.8% ± 9.6%; p < 0.05) rats. Finally, the Tb.Sp% was higher in OVX (53.8% ± 7.7%) compared to SHAM (27.5% ± 14.3%; p < 0.05) rats. In conclusion, within the limitations of this study, inducing an osteoporotic condition in a rat model negatively influenced bone regeneration in the created bone defect and grafted with a xenograft material.},

ABSTRACT = {Cellularized scaffold is emerging as the preferred solution for tissue regeneration and restoration of damaged functionalities. However, the high cost of preclinical studies creates a gap between investigation and the device market for the biomedical industry. In this work, bone-tailored scaffolds based on the Ti6Al4V alloy manufactured by electron beam melting (EBM) technology with reused powder were investigated, aiming to overcome issues connected to the high cost of preclinical studies. Two different elementary unit cell scaffold geometries, namely diamond (DO) and rhombic dodecahedron (RD), were adopted, while surface functionalization was performed by coating scaffolds with single layers of polycaprolactone (PCL) or with mixture of polycaprolactone and 20 wt.% hydroxyapatite (PCL/HA). The mechanical and biological performances of the produced scaffolds were investigated, and the results were compared to software simulation and experimental evidence available in literature. Good mechanical properties and a favorable environment for cell growth were obtained for all combinations of scaffold geometry and surface functionalization. In conclusion, powder recycling provides a viable practice for the biomedical industry to strongly reduce preclinical costs without altering biomechanical performance.},

ABSTRACT = {This work shows the synthesis of a polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) hydrogel by heat-activated polymerization and explores the production of hydrogels with an open porous network by lyophilisation to allow the three-dimensional culture of human oral mucosa stem cells (hOMSCs). The swollen hydrogel showed a storage modulus similar to oral mucosa and elastic solid rheological behaviour without sol transition. A comprehensive characterization of porosity by scanning electron microscopy, mercury intrusion porosimetry and nano-computed tomography (with spatial resolution below 1 μm) showed that lyophilisation resulted in the heterogeneous incorporation of closed oval-like pores in the hydrogel with broad size distribution (5 to 180 μm, d50 = 65 μm). Human oral mucosa biopsies were used to isolate hOMSCs, expressing typical markers of mesenchymal stem cells in more than 95% of the cell population. Direct contact cytotoxicity assay demonstrated that PVP hydrogel have no negative effect on cell metabolic activity, allowing the culture of hOMSCs with normal fusiform morphology. Pore connectivity should be improved in future to allow cell growth in the bulk of the PVP hydrogel.},

ABSTRACT = {The aim of this study was to evaluate the bio-absorption and bone regeneration of human tooth-derived dentin scaffold, entitled as perforated root-demineralized dentin matrix (PR-DDM), after in vivo implantation into the critical-size iliac defects. The dentin scaffolds were prepared from human vital, non-functional teeth. Thirty artificial macro-pores (Ø 1 mm) were added after removing the enamel portion. The modified teeth were supersonically demineralized in 0.34 N HNO3 for 30 min. The microstructure was observed by scanning electron microscope (SEM). The 3D micro-CT and histological analysis were carried out to evaluate the bio-absorption of PR-DDM at 2 and 4 months. A smooth dentin collagen surface with symmetrical macro-pores and tube-type dentinal tubules (Ø 1–2 µm) with micro-cracks were observed on the perforated region. A significant number of custom-made macro-pores disappeared, and the size of the macro-pores became significantly wider at 4 months compared with the 2 months (p < 0.05) evaluated by 3D micro-CT. Histological images revealed the presence of multinucleated giant cells attached to the scalloped border of the PR-DDM. The morphological changes due to bio-absorption by the cellular phagocytes were comparable to the 3D micro-CT and histological images at 2 and 4 months. Altogether, the results demonstrated that the PR-DDM block was gradually absorbed by multinucleated giant cells and regenerated bone. Human PR-DDM might serve as a unique scaffold for extraoral bone regeneration.},

ABSTRACT = {Lightweight cement mortars containing end-of-life tire rubber (TR) as aggregate were prepared and characterized by rheological, thermal, mechanical, microstructural, and wetting tests. The mixtures were obtained after total replacement of the conventional sand aggregate with untreated TR with different grain sizes (0–2 mm and 2–4 mm) and distributions (25%, 32%, and 40% by weight). The mortars showed lower thermal conductivities (≈90%) with respect to the sand reference due to the differences in the conductivities of the two phases associated with the low density of the aggregates and, to a minor extent, to the lack of adhesion of tire to the cement paste (evidenced by microstructural detection). In this respect, a decrease of the thermal conductivities was observed with the increase of the TR weight percentage together with a decrease of fluidity of the fresh mixture and a decrease of the mechanical strengths. The addition of expanded perlite (P, 0–1 mm grain size) to the mixture allowed us to obtain mortars with an improvement of the mechanical strengths and negligible modification of the thermal properties. Moreover, in this case, a decrease of the thermal conductivities was observed with the increase of the P/TR dosage together with a decrease of fluidity and of the mechanical strengths. TR mortars showed discrete cracks after failure without separation of the two parts of the specimens, and similar results were observed in the case of the perlite/TR samples thanks to the rubber particles bridging the crack faces. The super-elastic properties of the specimens were also observed in the impact compression tests in which the best performances of the tire and P/TR composites were evidenced by a deep groove before complete failure. Moreover, these mortars showed very low water penetration through the surface and also through the bulk of the samples thanks to the hydrophobic nature of the end-of-life aggregate, which makes these environmentally sustainable materials suitable for indoor and outdoor elements.},

ABSTRACT = {Magnesium-based materials are interesting alternatives for medical implants, as they have promising mechanical and biological properties. Thanks to them, it is possible to create biodegradable materials for medical application, which would reduce both costs and time of treatment. Magnesium as the sole material, however, it is not enough to support this function. It is important to determine proper alloying elements and methods. A viable method for creating such alloys is mechanical alloying, which can be used to design the structure and properties for proper roles. Mechanical alloying is highly influenced by the milling time of the alloy, as the time of the process affects many properties of the milled powders. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) were carried out to study the powder morphology and chemical composition of Mg65Zn30Ca4Gd1 powders. Moreover, the powder size was assessed by granulometric method and the Vickers hardness test was used for microhardness testing. The samples were milled for 6 min, 13, 20, 30, 40, and 70 h. The hardness correlated with the particle size of the samples. After 30 h of milling time, the average value of hardness was equal to 168 HV and it was lower after 13 (333 HV), 20 (273 HV), 40 (329 HV), and 70 (314 HV) h. The powder particles average size increased after 13 (31 μm) h of milling time, up to 30 (45–49 μm) hours, and then sharply decreased after 40 (28 μm) and 70 (12 μm) h.},

ABSTRACT = {Inhomogeneities and defects often limit the overall performance of thin-film solar cells. Therefore, sophisticated microscopy approaches are sought to characterize performance and defects at the nanoscale. Here, we demonstrate, for the first time, the simultaneous assessment of composition, structure, and performance in four-fold multi-modality. Using scanning X-ray microscopy of a Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) solar cell, we measured the elemental distribution of the key absorber elements, the electrical and optical response, and the phase shift of the coherent X-rays with nanoscale resolution. We found structural features in the absorber layer—interpreted as voids—that correlate with poor electrical performance and point towards defects that limit the overall solar cell efficiency.},

ABSTRACT = {The shear and particle crushing characteristics of the failure plane (or shear surface) in catastrophic mass movements are examined with a ring shear apparatus, which is generally employed owing to its suitability for large deformations. Based on results of previous experiments on waste materials from abandoned mine deposits, we employed a simple numerical model based on ring shear testing using the particle flow code (PFC2D). We examined drainage, normal stress, and shear velocity dependent shear characteristics of landslide materials. For shear velocities of 0.1 and 100 mm/s and normal stress (NS) of 25 kPa, the numerical results are in good agreement with those obtained from experimental results. The difference between the experimental and numerical results of the residual shear stress was approximately 0.4 kPa for NS equal to 25 kPa and 0.9 kPa for NS equal to 100 kPa for both drained and undrained condition. In addition, we examined particle crushing effect during shearing using the frictional work concept in PFC. We calculated the work done by friction at both peak and residual shear stresses, and then used the results as crushing criteria in the numerical analysis. The frictional work at peak and the residual shear stresses was ranged from 303 kPa·s to 2579 kPa·s for given drainage and normal stress conditions. These results showed that clump particles were partially crushed at peak shear stress, and further particle crushing with respect to the production of finer in shearing was recorded at residual shear stress at the shearing plane.},

ABSTRACT = {Titanium and its alloys are characterized by high biocompatibility and good corrosion resistance as a result of the ability to form a TiO2 oxide layer. However, based on literature data it can be concluded that titanium degradation products, in the form of titanium particles, metal-protein groups, oxides and ions, may cause allergic, inflammatory reactions and bone resorption. The corrosion process of Ti6Al4V in the human body environment may be intensified by a decreased pH and concentration of chloride compounds. The purpose of this article was to analyze the corrosion resistance of the Ti6Al4V alloy, obtained by the selective laser melting method in a corrosion solution of neutral pH and in a solution simulating peri-implant inflammatory conditions. Additionally, the influence of zinc oxide deposited by the atomic layer deposition method on the improvement of the physicochemical behavior of the Ti6Al4V alloy was analyzed. In order to characterize the ZnO layer, tests of chemical and phase composition as well as surface morphology investigation were performed. As part of the assessment of the physicochemical properties of the uncoated samples and those with the ZnO layer, tests of wetting angle, pitting corrosion and impedance corrosion were carried out. The number of ions released after the potentiodynamic test were measured using the inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP–AES) method. It can be concluded that samples after surface modification (with the ZnO layer) were characterized by favorable physicochemical properties and had higher corrosion resistance.},

ABSTRACT = {To investigate the effect of equal channel angular pressing (ECAP) on the deformation of Ti-6Al-4V alloy at a higher temperature, hot compression tests were conducted on alloys having two different initial microstructures (the original alloy (Pre-ECAP) and ECAP-deformed alloy (Post-ECAP)). Post-ECAP, the alloy showed a higher degree of dynamic softening during the hot deformation process due to its finer grain size and higher distortion energy. The flow stress of Post-ECAP alloy was higher than the Pre-ECAP alloy at 500 °C when ε˙= 0.003 s−1. However, the stress of the Post-ECAP alloy decreased rapidly with increasing temperature and strain rate, until the stress value was much lower than that of Pre-ECAP at 700 °C when ε˙= 0.03 s−1. The value of the dynamic softening coefficient revealed that the dynamic softening behavior of Post-ECAP was more pronounced than that of Pre-ECAP in the hot compression deformation process. The main dynamic softening mechanism of Pre-ECAP is dynamic recovery, while the dynamic recrystallization process plays a more important role in the deformation process of Post-ECAP alloy. The microstructures observation results showed that dynamic recrystallization was more likely to occur to Post-ECAP alloys under the same deformation condition. Almost fully dynamic recrystallization had occurred in the deformation process of Post-ECAP at 700 °C and a strain rate of ε˙= 0.01 s−1. The grains of Post-ECAP alloys were further refined. The Post-ECAP alloy exhibits better plastic deformation at temperatures higher than 600 °C due to its significant dynamic recrystallization.},

ABSTRACT = {This study investigated the optimum pickling conditions for improving the phosphatability of advanced high-strength steel (AHSS) using surface analysis and electrochemical measurements. To remove the SiO2 that forms on the surface of AHSS, 30 wt.% NH4HF2 was added to the pickling solution, resulting in a significant reduction in the amount of SiO2 remaining on the surface of the AHSS. The phosphatability was improved remarkably using HNO3 concentrations higher than 13% in the pickling solution. Furthermore, phosphate crystals became finer after pickling with a HNO3-based solution rather than a HCl-based solution. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data indicated that the corrosion resistance of AHSS subjected to HNO3-based pickling was higher than that of AHSS subjected to HCl-based pickling. Fluorine compounds, which were involved in the phosphate treatment process, were only formed on the surface of steel in HNO3-based solutions. The F compounds reacted with the phosphate solution to increase the pH of the bulk solution, which greatly improved the phosphatability. The phosphatability was better under HNO3-based conditions than a HCl-based condition due to the fineness of the phosphate structure and the increased surface roughness.},

ABSTRACT = {Indoor air quality can be adversely affected by emissions from building materials, consequently having a negative impact on human health and well-being. In this study, more than 30 natural building materials (earth dry boards and plasters, bio-based insulation materials, and boards made of wood, flax, reed, straw, etc.) used for interior works were investigated as to their emissions of (semi-)volatile organic compounds ((S)VOC), formaldehyde, and radon. The study focused on the emissions from complete wall build-ups as they can be used for internal partition walls and the internal insulation of external walls. Test chambers were designed, allowing the compounds to release only from the surface of the material facing indoors under testing parameters that were chosen to simulate model room conditions. The emission test results were evaluated using the AgBB evaluation scheme, a procedure for the health-related evaluation of construction products and currently applied for the approval of specific groups of building materials in Germany. Seventeen out of 19 sample build-ups tested in this study would have passed this scheme since they generally proved to be low-emitting and although the combined emissions of multiple materials were tested, 50% of the measurements could be terminated before half of the total testing time.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper describes the microstructure and properties of titanium-based composites obtained as a result of a reactive spark plasma sintering of a mixture of titanium and nanostructured (Ti,Mo)C-type carbide in a carbon shell. Composites with different ceramic addition mass percentage (10 and 20 wt %) were produced. Effect of content of elemental carbon covering nc-(Ti,Mo)C reinforcing phase particles on the microstructure, mechanical, tribological, and corrosion properties of the titanium-based composites was investigated. The microstructural evolution, mechanical properties, and tribological behavior of the Ti + (Ti,Mo)C/C composites were evaluated using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), electron backscatter diffraction analysis (EBSD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), 3D confocal laser scanning microscopy, nanoindentation, and ball-on-disk wear test. Moreover, corrosion resistance in a 3.5 wt % NaCl solution at RT were also investigated. It was found that the carbon content affected the tested properties. With the increase of carbon content from ca. 3 to 40 wt % in the (Ti,Mo)C/C reinforcing phase, an increase in the Young’s modulus, hardness, and fracture toughness of spark plasma sintered composites was observed. The results of abrasive and corrosive resistance tests were presented and compared with experimental data obtained for cp-Ti and Ti-6Al-4V alloy without the reinforcing phase. Moreover, it was found that an increase in the percentage of carbon increased the resistance to abrasive wear and to electrochemical corrosion of composites, measured by the relatively lower values of the friction coefficient and volume of wear and higher values of resistance polarization. This resistance results from the fact that a stable of TiO2 layer doped with MoO3 is formed on the surface of the composites. The results of experimental studies on the composites were compared with those obtained for cp-Ti and Ti-6Al-4V alloy without the reinforcing phase.},

ABSTRACT = {Understanding the relationship between the intrinsic characteristics of materials (such as rheological properties and structural build-up) and printability and controlling intrinsic characteristics of materials through additives to achieve excellent printability is vital in digital concrete additive manufacturing. This paper aims at studying the effects of material’s structural build-up on the interlayer bond strength of 3DPC with different time gaps. Structural build-up can indirectly affect the interlayer bond strength by affecting the surface moisture of concrete. Based on the structural build-up of 3DPC, a new parameter, maximum operational time (MOT), is proposed, which can be considered as the limit of time gap to ensure high interlayer bond strength. Slump-retaining polycarboxylate superplasticizer (TS) slightly slows down the physical flocculation rate, but increases the maximum operational time of the cement paste. Nano clay significantly increases the sort-term structural build-up rate and has the function of internal curing and water retaining. Composite with nano-clay and TS can reduce the loss of surface moisture of 3D printed layers, prevent the formation of interface weak layer, and increase the interlayer bond strength between printed layers. This contribution can provide new insight into the design of 3D-printed ink with good extrudability, outstanding buildability, and excellent interlayer bond strength.},

ABSTRACT = {Background: Magnesium has been used as degradable fixation material for osteosynthesis, but it seems that mechanical strength is still a current issue in these fixations. The aim of this study was to evaluate the axial pull-out force of compression headless screws made of magnesium alloy during their resorption. Methods: The tests included screws made for osteosynthesis of the mandible head: 2.2 mm diameter magnesium alloy MgYREZr (42 screws) and 2.5 mm diameter polylactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) (42 pieces, control). The screws were resorbed in Sørensen’s buffer for 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16 weeks, and force was measured as the screw was pulled out from the polyurethane block. Results: The force needed to pull the screw out was significantly higher for MgYREZr screws than for PLGA ones (p < 0.01). Within eight weeks, the pull-out force for MgYREZr significantly decreased to one third of its initial value (p < 0.01). The dynamics of this decrease were greater than those of the pull-out force for PLGA screws (p < 0.05). After these eight weeks, the values for metal and polymer screws equalized. It seems that the described reduction of force requires taking into account when using magnesium screws. This will provide more stable resorbable metallic osteosynthesis.},

ABSTRACT = {Thermal management has become one of the crucial factors in designing electronic equipment and therefore creating composites with high thermal conductivity is necessary. In this work, a new insight on hybrid filler strategy is proposed to enhance the thermal conductivity in Thermoplastic polyurethanes (TPU). Firstly, spherical aluminium oxide/hexagonal boron nitride (ABN) functional hybrid fillers are synthesized by the spray drying process. Then, ABN/TPU thermally conductive composite material is produced by melt mixing and hot pressing. Then, ABN/TPU thermally conductive composite material is produced by melt mixing and hot pressing. Our results demonstrate that the incorporation of spherical hybrid ABN filler assists in the formation of a three-dimensional continuous heat conduction structure that enhances the thermal conductivity of the neat thermoplastic TPU matrix. Hence, we present a valuable method for preparing the thermal interface materials (TIMs) with high thermal conductivity, and this method can also be applied to large-scale manufacturing.},

ABSTRACT = {The paper is dedicated to the life prolongation of the tools designed for deep-hole drilling. Among available methods, an ion implantation process was used to improve the durability of tungsten carbide (WC)-Co guide pads. Nitrogen fluencies of 3 × 1017 cm−2, 4 × 1017 cm−2 and 5 × 1017 cm−2 were applied, and scanning electron microscope (SEM) observations, energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analyses, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS) measurements were performed for both nonimplanted and implanted tools. The durability tests of nonimplanted and the modified tools were performed in industrial conditions. The durability of implanted guide pads was above 2.5 times greater than nonimplanted ones in the best case, presumably due to the presence of a carbon-rich layer and extremely hard tungsten nitrides. The achieved effect may be attributed to the dissociation of tungsten carbide phase and to the lubrication effect. The latter was due to the presence of pure carbon layer with a thickness of a few dozen nanometers. Notably, this layer was formed at a temperature of 200 °C, much smaller than in previously reported research, which makes the findings even more valuable from economic and environmental perspectives.},

ABSTRACT = {Discarded polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles have damaged our ecosystem. Problems of marine fauna conservation and land fertility have been related to the disposal of these materials. Recycled fibre is an opportunity to reduce the levels of waste in the world and increase the mechanical performance of the concrete. PET as concrete reinforcement has demonstrated ductility and post-cracking strength. However, its performance could be optimized. This study considers a statistical-experimental analysis to evaluate recycled PET fibre reinforced concrete with various fibre dose and aspect ratio. 120 samples were experimented under workability, compressive, flexural, and splitting tensile tests. The results pointed out that the fibre dose has more influence on the responses than its fibre aspect ratio, with statistical relation on the tensional toughness, equivalent flexural strength ratio, volumetric weight, and the number of fibres. Moreover, the fibre aspect ratio has a statistical impact on the tensional toughness. In general, the data indicates that the optimal recycled PET fibre reinforced concrete generates a superior performance than control samples, with an improvement similar to those reinforced with virgin fibres.},

ABSTRACT = {Nonlinear ultrasound is often employed to assess microdamage or nonlinear elastic properties of a material, and the nonlinear parameter is commonly used to quantify damage sate and material properties. Among the various factors that influence the measurement of nonlinear parameters, maintaining a constant contact pressure between the receiver and specimen is important for repeatability of the measurement. The use of an air-coupled transducer may be considered to replace the contact receiver. In this paper, a method of measuring the relative and absolute nonlinear parameters of materials is described using an air-coupled transducer as a receiver. The diffraction and attenuation corrections are newly derived from an acoustic model for a two-layer medium and the nonlinear parameter formula with all corrections is defined. Then, we show that the ratio of the relative nonlinear parameter of the target sample to the reference sample is equal to that of the absolute nonlinear parameter, and this equivalence is confirmed by measurements on three systems of aluminum samples. The proposed method allows the absolute measurement of the nonlinear parameter ratio or the nonlinear parameter without calibration of the air-coupled receiver and removes restrictions on the selection of reference samples.},

ABSTRACT = {Most engineering structures are composed of basic components such as plates, shells, and beams, and their dynamic characteristics under explosion load determine the impact resistance of the structure. In this paper, a three-dimensional composite steel structure was designed using a beam, plate, and other basic elements to study its mechanical behavior under explosion load. Subsequently, experiments on the composite steel structure under explosion load were carried out to study its mechanical behavior, and the failure mode and deformation data of the composite steel structure were obtained, which provided important experimental data regarding the dynamic response and mechanical behavior of the composite steel structure under explosion load. Then, we independently developed a parallel program with the coupled calculation method to solve the numerical simulation of the dynamic response and failure process of the composite steel structure under explosion load. This program adopts the Euler method as a whole, and Lagrange particles are used for materials that need to be accurately tracked. The numerical calculation results are in good agreement with the experimental data, indicating that the developed parallel program can effectively deal with the large deformation problems of multi-medium materials and the numerical simulation of the complex engineering structure failures subjected to the strong impact load.},

ABSTRACT = {This research studied a new material named modified infrared powder (MIRP) for decreasing the high temperature of asphalt pavements which can help alleviate the urban heat island effect to some extent. Based on the physical apparent density tests of materials and infrared thermal radiation test, the cooling performance of MIRP was obtained. X-ray diffraction analysis and scanning electron microscopy test (SEM) were conducted to analyze the chemical composition and the microstructure of MIRP, respectively. According to the radiant heat transfer theory, a thermal radiation model of the pavement equilibrium temperature was established by microscopic and chemical analysis to study the influence of thermal radiation asphalt mixture and reveal its cooling performance. The results show that the main components of MIRP are metal oxides and nonmetallic oxides which improve its infrared emissivity. Compared with limestone mineral powder asphalt mortar, the asphalt mortar with MIRP had a more compact structure and uniform distribution, and enhanced the overall structural performance of the mixture. The thermal radiation model reveals that the pavement equilibrium temperature combined with the MIRP in asphalt mixture decreases with the increase of the longwave emissivity, and it diminishes with the decrease of the shortwave absorptivity.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper focuses on the possibility of adapting the centrifugal slip casting method to obtain zirconia–alumina composite materials in the form of finished tube-shaped products. These types of products, due to their unique properties, can be utilised, for example, in the transport of aggressive substances, even in extreme temperatures or corrosive conditions. The study reports on the two series of zirconia–alumina composites differing in the content of ZrO2—2.5 and 25 vol%. The fabricated and sintered materials were characterised using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and stereological analysis. Moreover, a life cycle assessment (LCA) was provided in accordance with the requirements of the ISO 14044 and EN 15805 standards. The obtained data clearly show that the centrifugal slip casting method allows obtaining samples with high density and extremely uniform distribution of the ZrO2 phase in the alumina matrix. The stereological analysis results proved also that the addition of ZrO2 is effective in reducing the growth of Al2O3 grains during the sintering process. The phase analysis carried out by means of XRD showed that during the sintering process, in the case of composites with a lower ZrO2 content (2.5 vol%), the monoclinic to tetragonal transformation of ZrO2 was total, while for samples containing 25 vol% ZrO2, the monoclinic phase remained in a small amount in the final product.},

ABSTRACT = {17-4PH stainless steel specimens were fabricated by fused deposition of metals (FDMet) technology, which combines 17-4PH particles with an organic binder. FDMet promises a low-cost additive manufacturing process. The present research aims to clarify the influence of layer directions in the 3D printing process on the mechanical and shrinkage properties of as-sintered and as-aged specimens. All specimens (the as-sintered and as-aged specimens printed in three layer directions) exhibited high relative density (97.5–98%). The highest ultimate strengths (880 and 1140 MPa in the as-sintered and as-aged specimens, respectively) were obtained when the layer direction was perpendicular to the tensile direction. Conversely, the specimens printed with their layer direction parallel to the tensile direction presented a low ultimate strength and low strain at breakage. The fact that the specimens with their layer direction parallel to the tensile direction presented a low ultimate strength and low strain at breakage is a usual behavior of parts obtained by means of FDM. The SEM images revealed oriented binder domains in the printed parts and oriented voids in the sintered parts. It was assumed that large binder domains in the filament were oriented perpendicular to the layer directions during the fused deposition modeling printing, and remained as oriented voids after sintering. Stress concentration in the oriented void defects was likely responsible for the poor tensile properties of these specimens.},

ABSTRACT = {Antimicrobial textile structures are developed based on polypropylene (PP) and a natural material, hydrolyzed casein. The casein, from bovine milk, is subjected to acid hydrolysis in aqueous media, then blended into the PP matrix in the melt phase by extrusion. The obtained blend, containing 5 wt.% of hydrolyzed casein, is then processed by a melt spinning process to get multifilaments, leading to the production knitting structures. Thanks to the addition of the hydrolyzed casein, the obtained textile showed a strong antibacterial activity towards both Gram (+) and Gram (−) bacterial strains. The addition of 5 wt.% hydrolyzed casein does not significantly impact the mechanical properties of PP in the dumbbells form, but a small decrease was observed in the tenacity of the filaments. No moisture retention was observed after the addition of hydrolyzed casein, but the rheological behavior was slightly affected. The obtained results can contribute to addressing concerns regarding nonrenewable antibacterial agents used in textile materials, particularly their effects on the environment and human health, by offering antibacterial agents from a biobased and edible substance with high efficiency. They are also promising to respond to issues of wasting dairy products and recycling them, in addition to the advantages of using melt processes.},

ABSTRACT = {Inorganically-bound core materials are used in foundries in high quantities. However, there is no validated mechanical failure criterion, which allows performing finite-element calculations on the core geometries, yet. With finite-element simulations, the cores could be optimised for various production processes from robotic core handling to the decoring process after the casting. To identify a failure criterion, we propose testing methods, that enable us to investigate the fracture behaviour of inorganically-bound core materials. These novel testing methods induce multiple bi-axial stress states into the specimens and are developed for cohesive frictional materials in general and for sand cores in particular. This allows validating failure criteria in principal stress space. We found that a Mohr-Coulomb model describes the fracture of inorganic core materials in a plane stress state quite accurately and adapted it to a failure criterion, which combines the Mohr-Coulomb model with the Weakest-Link theory in one consistent mechanical material model. This novel material model has been successfully utilised to predict the fracture force of a Brazilian test. This prediction is based on the stress fields of a finite element method (FEM) calculation.},

ABSTRACT = {The contribution of concrete to the tensile stiffness (tension stiffening) of a reinforced concrete (RC) member is a key governing factor for structural serviceability analyses. However, among the current tension stiffening models, few consider the effect brought forth by concrete shrinkage, and none studies take account of the effect for very long-term shrinkage. The present work intends to tackle this exact issue by testing multiple RC tensile elements (with different bar diameters and reinforcement ratios) after a five-year shrinking time period. The experimental deformative and tension stiffening responses were subjected to a mathematical process of shrinkage removal aimed at assessing its effect on the former. The results showed shrinkage distinctly lowered the cracking load of the RC members and caused an apparent tension stiffening reduction. Furthermore, both of these effects were exacerbated in the members with higher reinforcement ratios. The experimental and shrinkage-free behaviors of the RC elements were finally compared to the values predicted by the CEB-fib Model Code 2010 and the Euro Code 2. Interestingly, as a consequence of the long-term shrinkage, the codes expressed a smaller relative error when compared to the shrinkage-free curves versus the experimental ones.},

ABSTRACT = {In the present study, the shape, memory, and mechanical properties of cold-rolled and annealed Fe-17Mn-5Si-5Cr-4Ni-1Ti-0.3C (wt.%) alloy were investigated. The cold-rolled alloy was annealing heat-treated at different temperatures in the range of 500–900 °C for 30 min. The shape recovery behavior of the alloy was investigated using strip bending test followed by recovery heating. The microstructural evolution and the stress-strain response of the alloy heat-treated at different temperatures revealed that the recovery took place at a heat-treatment temperature higher than 600 °C. Recrystallization occurred when the heat-treatment temperature was higher than 800 °C. Meaningful shape recovery was observed only when the alloy was annealed at temperatures higher than 600 °C. The highest recovery strain of up to 2.56% was achieved with a pre-strain of 5.26% and recovery heating temperature of 400 °C, when the alloy was heat-treated at 700 °C. Conversely, the yield strength reduced significantly with increasing annealing heat-treatment temperature. The experimental observations presented in this paper provide a guideline for post-annealing heat-treatment when a good compromise between mechanical property and shape recovery performance is required.},

ABSTRACT = {The presented research’s main objective was to develop the solution to the global problem of using steel waste obtained during rubber recovery during the tire recycling. A detailed comparative analysis of mechanical and physical features of the concrete composite with the addition of recycled steel fibres (RSF) in relation to the steel fibre concrete commonly used for industrial floors was conducted. A study was carried out using micro-computed tomography and the scanning electron microscope to determine the fibres’ characteristics, incl. the EDS spectrum. In order to designate the full performance of the physical and mechanical features of the novel composite, a wide range of tests was performed with particular emphasis on the determination of the tensile strength of the composite. This parameter appointed by tensile strength testing for splitting, residual tensile strength test (3-point test), and a wedge splitting test (WST), demonstrated the increase of tensile strength (vs unmodified concrete) by 43%, 30%, and 70% relevantly to the method. The indication of the reinforced composite’s fracture characteristics using the digital image correlation (DIC) method allowed to illustrate the map of deformation of the samples during WST. The novel composite was tested in reference to the circular economy concept and showed 31.3% lower energy consumption and 30.8% lower CO2 emissions than a commonly used fibre concrete.},

ABSTRACT = {The aim of the paper is to present the results of research on the carbonation process kinetics of coal combustion ashes originating from fluidized bed boilers used in power plants. Based on the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), the hypothesis that carbon dioxide is bounded by the mineral substances (calcium compounds) in the fly ashes was confirmed. Determining the kinetic parameters of the carbonation of fly ashes requires simultaneously taking into consideration the kinetics of the drying process of the sample. The drying process of the sample masks the effect of the reaction of CO2 with calcium compound. Unlike the ashes generated in pulverized fuel boilers, fly ashes contain irregular amorphic mineral components or poorly crystalized products of complete or partial dehydroxylation of claystone substance present in shale formations constituting the gangue as well as anhydrite (CaSO4), a desulfurization product. The content of free calcium oxide (CaO) in such ashes ranges from a few to several percent, which is a significant obstacle considering their use in cement and concrete production as type II admixtures understood to be inorganic grained materials of pozzolanic or latent hydraulic properties. The paper presents effective mechanisms which reduce the content of free CaO in ashes from Fluidized Bed Combustion (FBC) boilers to a level that allows their commercial utilization in the cement industry.},

TGA showed that thermal stability of irradiated ETFE is considerably lower than that of unirradiated ETFE. DSC indicates that crystallinity is altered greatly by cross-link. The analysis of mechanical properties, fracture surface morphology, visco-elastic properties and volume resistivity certify radiation-induced cross-linking is vital to aging properties.},

ABSTRACT = {To investigate the effect of hot working parameters on the flow behavior of 300M steel under tension, hot uniaxial tensile tests were implemented under different temperatures (950 °C, 1000 °C, 1050 °C, 1100 °C, 1150 °C) and strain rates (0.01 s−1, 0.1 s−1, 1 s−1, 10 s−1). Compared with uniaxial compression, the tensile flow stress was 29.1% higher because dynamic recrystallization softening was less sufficient in the tensile stress state. The ultimate elongation of 300M steel increased with the decrease of temperature and the increase of strain rate. To eliminate the influence of sample necking on stress-strain relationship, both the stress and the strain were calibrated using the cross-sectional area of the neck zone. A constitutive model for tensile deformation was established based on the modified Arrhenius model, in which the model parameters (n, α, Q, ln(A)) were described as a function of strain. The average deviation was 6.81 MPa (6.23%), showing good accuracy of the constitutive model.},

The dynamic tests were performed at three different impact velocities. Under three different velocities, no obvious shear failure occurred in the composite, indicating a good impact resistance. Compared to the quasi-static compression test, the dynamic yield strength increased obviously with the rise of velocity, even more than 1 GPa. The dislocation multiplication, phonon drag effect and ceramic reinforcement increased the flow stress of composite. Fine, equiaxed grain structure developed after impact, resulting from grain fragmentation or dynamic recrystallization. Finite element simulation of Taylor impact was qualitatively in agreement with the experiments, which was useful to elucidate the formation of equiaxed grain structure.},

ABSTRACT = {Different concrete structures (viaducts, bridges, or tunnels) in the neighborhoods of railways may be subject to the stray current leaking from the rails. In these cases, the reinforcing rebars embedded in concrete act as conductors, “pick up” the stray current, and can corrode. For simulating the stray current-induced corrosion of metals, most researchers just supplied anodic polarization on samples. However, stray current induces both cathodic polarization and anodic polarization. This work experimentally justifies the different effects of stray current and anodic polarization on reinforcing steel embedded in mortar. A comparison between stray current and anodic polarization effects on the corrosion behavior of embedded steel is performed for both fresh (24 hour-cured) and hardened matrix (28 day-cured) in chloride-free (Cl-free) and chloride-containing (Cl-containing) environments. It is found that in all studied conditions, anodic polarization leads to a significantly different electrochemical performance of the steel rebar compared to the stray current. Hence, anodic polarization cannot reflect all the effects of stray current, and therefore, it has limited significance for simulating stray current. It is also clarified that the curing regimes and starting time of the stray current play significant roles in the formation of a corrosion product layer on the steel surface.},

ABSTRACT = {The article deals with the problems of cracking in the structure of multilayered coatings under the conditions of stochastic loading process. A mathematical model has been proposed in order to predict the crack propagation velocity in the coating while taking the influence of interlayer interfaces into account. A technique for calculating the probability density distribution of the coating fracture (failure rate) has been developed. The probability of a change in the crack growth direction is compared with the experimental data that were obtained as a result of the studies focused on the pattern of cracking in the Zr,Nb-(Zr,Nb)N-(Zr,Nb,Al)N and Ti-TiN-(Ti,Cr,Al)N coatings under the conditions of the real stochastic loading of cutting tools during the turning. The influence of the crystalline structure of the coating on the cracking pattern has been studied. The investigation has found the significant effect of the crystalline structure of the coating layers on the cracking pattern.},

ABSTRACT = {Formaldehyde is considered as carcinogenic and is emitted from particleboards and plywood used in toy manufacturing. Currently, the flask method is frequently used in Europe for market surveillance purposes to assess formaldehyde release from toys, but its concordance to levels measured in emission test chambers is poor. Surveillance laboratories are unable to afford laborious and expensive emission chamber testing to comply with a new amendment of the European Toy Directive; they need an alternative method that can provide reliable results. Therefore, the application of miniaturised emission test chambers was tested. Comparisons between a 1 m3 emission test chamber and 44 mL microchambers with two particleboards over 28 days and between a 24 L desiccator chamber and the microchambers with three puzzle samples over 10 days resulted in a correlation coefficient r2 of 0.834 for formaldehyde at steady state. The correlation between the results obtained in microchambers vs. flask showed a high variability over 10 samples (r2: 0.145), thereby demonstrating the error-proneness of the flask method in comparison to methods carried out under ambient parameters. An exposure assessment was also performed for three toy puzzles: indoor formaldehyde concentrations caused by puzzles were not negligible (up to 8 µg/m3), especially when more conservative exposure scenarios were considered.},

ABSTRACT = {Adipose tissue-derived stromal cells (ASCs) represent a capable source for cell-based therapeutic approaches. For monitoring a cell-based application in vivo, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of cells labeled with iron oxide particles is a common method. It is the aim of the present study to analyze potential DNA damage, cytotoxicity and impairment of functional properties of human (h)ASCs after labeling with citrate-coated very small superparamagnetic iron oxide particles (VSOPs). Cytotoxic as well as genotoxic effects of the labeling procedure were measured in labeled and unlabeled hASCs using the MTT assay, comet assay and chromosomal aberration test. Trilineage differentiation was performed to evaluate an impairment of the differentiation potential due to the particles. Proliferation as well as migration capability were analyzed after the labeling procedure. Furthermore, the labeling of the hASCs was confirmed by Prussian blue staining, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution MRI. Below the concentration of 0.6 mM, which was used for the procedure, no evidence of genotoxic effects was found. At 0.6 mM, 1 mM as well as 1.5 mM, an increase in the number of chromosomal aberrations was determined. Cytotoxic effects were not observed at any concentration. Proliferation, migration capability and differentiation potential were also not affected by the procedure. Labeling with VSOPs is a useful labeling method for hASCs that does not affect their proliferation, migration and differentiation potential. Despite the absence of cytotoxicity, however, indications of genotoxic effects have been demonstrated.},

ABSTRACT = {The copper (II) complex of ursolic acid (Cu(II) UA) was synthesized and discussed in terms of its infrared, UV–visible spectra, quantum-chemical calculations at B3LYP/6-31G(d) level and antioxidant capacity. The copper (II) complex was stable in methanolic solution with the molar ratio metal:ligand 1:1. The data obtained by FT-IR confirmed the metal ion coordination through the carboxylate anion. The antioxidant properties of ursolic acid and its complex with Cu were discussed on the basis of energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and values of chemical reactivity parameters. The antiradical properties of ursolic acid and the Cu (II) complex were examined against DPPH• and HO• radicals, and the ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) was examined. The Cu(II) complex showed higher antioxidant activity than ursolic acid, i.e., in DPPH• assay, the EC50 for UA was 47.0 mM, whereas, for Cu(II), UA EC50 = 19.5 mM; the FRAP value for UA was 20.8 µMFe2+, and 35.4 µMFe2+ for Cu(II) UA (compound concentration 3 mM). Although there was no distinct difference in the antioxidant activity against HO• between these two chemicals, they were both better HO• scavengers than DPPH• and showed different kinetics in the reaction with DPPH•.},

ABSTRACT = {Al–Cu matrix composites with excellent mechanical and thermal properties are among the most promising materials for realising high performance in thermal management systems. However, intermetallic compounds (ICs) formed at the Al/Cu interfaces prevent direct contact between the metals and severely deteriorate the thermal conductivity of the composite. In this study, we systemically investigated the formation behaviour of Al–Cu ICs as a function of compaction pressure at a low temperature of 380 °C. The phases of the Al–Cu ICs formed during sintering were detected via X-ray diffraction, and the layer thickness and average area fraction of each IC at different compaction pressures were analysed via micro-scale observations of the cross-sections of the Al–Cu composites. The ICs were partially formed along the Al/Cu interfaces at high pressures, and the formation region was related to the direction of applied pressure. The Vickers hardness of the Al–Cu composites with ICs was nearly double those calculated using the rule of mixtures. On the other hand, the thermal conductivity of the composites increased with compaction pressure and reached 201 W·m−1·K−1. This study suggests the possibility of employing Al–Cu matrix composites with controlled IC formation in thermal management applications.},

ABSTRACT = {The article presents a new functional method of designing self-compacting concrete (SCC). The assumptions of the functional method of designing self-compacting concrete were based on the double coating assumption (i.e., it was assumed that the grains of coarse aggregate were coated with a layer of cement mortar, whereas the grains of sand with cement paste). The proposed method is composed of four stages, each of which is responsible for the selection of a different component of the concrete mix. The proposed designing procedure takes into consideration such a selection of the mineral skeleton in terms of the volumetric saturation of the mineral skeleton, which prevents the blocking of aggregate grains, and the designed liquid phase demonstrated high structural viscosity and low yield stress. The performed experimental studies, the simulation of the elaborated mathematical model fully allowed for the verification of the theoretical assumptions that are the basis for the development of the method of designing self-compacting concrete.},

ABSTRACT = {Eucalyptus nitens is a fast-growing wood species with a relevant presence in countries like Australia and Chile. The sustainable construction goals have driven the search of structural applications for Eucalyptus nitens; however, this process has been complicated due to the defects usually presented in these timber boards. This study aims to evaluate the dynamic elasticity modulus (Exd) of Eucalyptus nitens timber boards through non-destructive vibration-based tests. Thirty-six timber boards with different levels of knots and cracks were instrumented and tested in a simply supported condition by measuring longitudinal and transverse vibrations. In the first stage, the Exd was calculated globally through simplified normative formulas. Then, in a second stage, the local variability of the Exd was estimated using operational modal analysis (OMA), finite element numerical simulations (FEM), and regional sensitivity analysis (RSA). The positive correlation found between the global static modulus of elasticity and Exd suggests that non-destructive techniques could be used as a reliable and fast alternative for the assessment of bending stiffness. Finally, the proposed method to estimate the local variability of Exdt based on the combination of OMA, FEM, and RSA techniques was useful to improve the structural selection process of timber boards for lightweight social housing floors.},

ABSTRACT = {Microbial-induced calcite precipitation (MICP) has been a promising method to improve geotechnical engineering properties through the precipitation of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) on the contact and surface of soil particles in recent years. In the present experiment, water absorption and unconfined compressive strength (UCS) tests were carried out to investigate the effects of three different fiber types (glass fiber, polyester fiber, and hemp fiber) on the physical and mechanical properties of MICP-treated calcareous sand. The fibers used were at 0%, 0.10%, 0.15%, 0.20%, 0.25%, 0.30%, 0.35%, and 0.40% relative to the weight of the sand. The results showed that the failure strain and ductility of the samples could be improved by adding fibers. Compared to biocemented sand (BS), the water absorption of these three fiber-reinforced biocemented sands were, respectively, decreased by 11.60%, 21.18%, and 7.29%. UCS was, respectively, increased by 24.20%, 60.76%, and 6.40%. Polyester fiber produced the best effect, followed by glass fiber and hemp fiber. The optimum contents of glass fiber and polyester fiber were 0.20% and 0.25%, respectively. The optimum content of hemp fiber was within the range of 0.20–0.25%. Light-emitting diode (LED) microscope and scanning electron microscope (SEM) images lead to the conclusion that only a little calcite precipitation had occurred around the hemp fiber, leading to a poor bonding effect compared to the glass and polyester fibers. It was therefore suggested that polyester fiber should be used to improve the properties of biocemented sand.},

The parameters of the MD and ACTG groups were compared with samples of the control group (CG) after 15, 45, and 90 days. Nine female white pigs (Sus scrofa domestica) were used, and each animal provided 20 study areas (12 MD and 8 ACTG). At 15 days, the keratin layer thickness in the MD group was greater than those of the ACTG (25.27 vs. 19.95 μm) and the CG (21.2 μm). After 45 days, the MD and ACTG thickness values decreased but were higher than the CG. At 90 days, MD (19.46 μm) obtained a value close to that of CG, and the ACTG decreased to CG (15.53 μm, p < 0.001). The use of an MD may be a viable alternative to the ACTG because of its ability to provide increased keratinized tissue in comparison to the ACTG.},

ABSTRACT = {The aim of the present study was to evaluate correlations between bone density and implant primary stability, considering various determinants such as age, gender, and geometry of implants (design, diameter). Bone density of edentulous posterior maxillae was assessed by computed tomography (CT)-derived Hounsfield units, and implant primary stability values were measured with insertion torque and resonance frequency analysis (RFA). A total of 60 implants in 30 partially edentulous patients were evaluated in the posterior maxilla with two different types of dental implants. The bone density evaluated by CT-derived Hounsfield units showed a significant correlation with primary stability parameters. The bone quality was more influenced by gender rather than age, and the type of implant was insignificant when determining primary stability. Such results imply that primary stability parameters can be used for objective assessment of bone quality, allowing surgical modifications especially in sites suspected of poor bone quality.},

ABSTRACT = {The traditional solid-state reaction method was employed to synthesize bulk calcium cobaltite (Ca349/Ca3Co4O9) ceramics via ball milling the precursor mixture. The samples were compacted using conventional sintering (CS) and spark plasma sintering (SPS) at 850, 900, and 950 °C. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern indicates the presence of the Ca349 phase for samples sintered at 850 and 900 °C. In addition, SPS fosters higher densification (81.18%) than conventional sintering (50.76%) at elevated sintering temperatures. The thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential thermal analysis (DTA) performed on the precursor mixture reported a weight loss of ~25.23% at a temperature range of 600–820 °C. This current work aims to analyze the electrical properties (Seebeck coefficient (s), electrical resistivity (ρ), and power factor) of sintered samples as a function of temperature (35–500 °C). It demonstrates that the change in sintering temperature (conventional sintering) did not evince any significant change in the Seebeck coefficient (113–142 μV/K). However, it reported a low resistivity of 153–132 μΩ-m and a better power factor (82–146.4 μW/mK2) at 900 °C. On the contrary, the SPS sintered samples recorded a higher Seebeck coefficient of 121–181 μV/K at 900 °C. Correspondingly, the samples sintered at 950 °C delineated a low resistivity of 145–158 μΩ-m and a better power factor (97–152 μW/mK2).},

ABSTRACT = {In this study, tap water is magnetized by a self-developed device. The conductivity and evaporation of magnetized water (MW) at different temperatures are tested to demonstrate the magnetization mechanism. The results show that the conductivity and evaporation of the magnetized water increase to different degrees compared with regular tap water (RW). The maximum increase in conductivity is 10.6%, and the maximum increase in evaporation is 25.6% and 16.7% at 50 and 80 °C, respectively. Cement grout samples with water-cement ratios (w/c) of 0.5 and 1.0 were prepared with magnetized water. The stability of the cement grout mixed with RW and MW under different magnetic conditions is tested. The compressive strength and SEM images of the hardened cement grout samples mixed with RW and MW (under optimum magnetic conditions) are compared. The cement grout prepared with MW has a higher stability compared to that of the control specimen, and the relative change of bleeding volume of the MW cement grout with w/c = 0.5 and 1 is 67.69% and 24.36%, respectively. MW has a positive effect on the consolidation compressive strength of cement grout. SEM images show that hardened cement grout with MW has more hydrate crystals, more compact filling space between cement particles, more contact points, and fewer voids compared to that of RW. The influence mechanism of MW on the stability of cement grout is analyzed, which provides a theoretical basis for the application of MW in the field of grouting engineering.},

ABSTRACT = {Electrospun materials, due to their unique properties, have found many applications in the biomedical field. Exploiting their porous nanofibrous structure, they are often used as scaffolds in tissue engineering which closely resemble a native cellular environment. The structural and mechanical properties of the substrates need to be carefully optimised to mimic cues used by the extracellular matrix to guide cells’ behaviour and improve existing scaffolds. Optimisation of these parameters is enabled by using the finite element model of electrospun structures proposed in this study. First, a fully parametric three-dimensional microscopic model of electrospun material with a random fibrous network was developed. Experimental results were obtained by testing electrospun poly(ethylene) oxide materials. Parameters of single fibres were determined by atomic force microscopy nanoindentations and used as input data for the model. The validation was performed by comparing model output data with tensile test results obtained for electrospun mats. We performed extensive analysis of model parameters correlations to understand the crucial factors and enable extrapolation of a simplified model. We found good agreement between the simulation and the experimental data. The proposed model is a potent tool in the optimisation of electrospun structures and scaffolds for enhanced regenerative therapies.},

ABSTRACT = {Advanced amorphous coatings consisting of Co-based metallic glasses with ultrahigh strength (6 GPa) and high microhardness (up to 17 GPa) can significantly improve the surface properties of matrix materials. However, the intrinsic brittleness of Co-based metallic glasses can lead to the initiation of microcracks caused by the inevitable generation of thermal stress during the laser cladding process, which severely limits the potential application. In this paper, the methods of increasing substrate temperature and fabricating composite coatings with the addition of toughened Fe powders were adopted to inhibit the generation of microcracks in the Co55Ta10B35 amorphous coatings. Moreover, neutron shielding performances of the cladding coatings with high B content were investigated with a wide range of neutron energy (wavelength: 0.15–0.85 nm). The results indicate that the fully amorphous coating and composite ones can be fabricated successfully. The increase in the substrate temperature and the addition of Fe powders can effectively inhibit the initiation and propagation of microcracks. The fully Co-based amorphous coating with high B content (35 at.%) can exhibit excellent neutron shielding performance. With the addition of Fe powders, the neutron shielding performance is reduced gradually due to the dilution effect of B in the composite cladding coatings, but the microcrack will be completely restrained.},

ABSTRACT = {Preplaced Aggregate Fibrous Concrete (PAFC) is a newly minted composite that has recently become more popular. The production of PAFC involves two essential processes; first, the fibres and coarse aggregate were filled into the empty framework to form the first layer of a natural skeleton, followed by grout injecting. A cement grout fills the voids in the first layer skeleton with slight compaction. This process is repeated to complete the remaining layers; hence, a type of Functionally-graded Preplaced Aggregate Fibrous Concrete (FPAFC) is obtained. The most recent studies revealed that the literature regarding the high-velocity projectile impact on fibrous concrete is well documented; however, the low-velocity repeated projectile impact on PAFC is still unexplored and needs particular emphasis. This research aims to investigate the FPAFC made with a new type of steel and polypropylene fibres against low-velocity projectile impact to fill this research gap. In the current study, twelve mixes were prepared with mono and hybrid combinations of fibres for pioneering the possible utilization of fibres in FPAFC. The maximum fibre dosage in this study is limited to 2.4%. The projectile impact resistance of FPAFC was assessed in line with penetration depth, front and rear damage surface area, weight loss, damage ratio and failure pattern. Additionally, a simplified analytical model was introduced to compute the ejected composite mass from the tested specimens. The results revealed that the addition of steel fibre in a single layer FPAFC exhibited an increasing compressive strength trend compared to the two/three-layered FPAFC. Furthermore, increasing the dosage of fibre at the bottom and top layers of FPAFC with a hybrid combination alleviates the spalling with an increasing number of impacts. The results from this research offer the reference information for more detailed research and studies of FPAFC under low-velocity projectile impact.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper reports the binary colloid assembly of nanospheres using spin coating techniques. Polystyrene spheres with sizes of 900 and 100 nm were assembled on top of silicon substrates utilizing a spin coater. Two different spin coating processes, namely concurrent and sequential coatings, were employed. For the concurrent spin coating, 900 and 100 nm colloidal nanospheres of latex were first mixed and then simultaneously spin coated onto the silicon substrate. On the other hand, the sequential coating process first created a monolayer of a 900 nm nanosphere array on the silicon substrate, followed by the spin coating of another layer of a 100 nm colloidal array on top of the 900 nm array. The influence of the processing parameters, including the type of surfactant, spin speed, and spin time, on the self-assembly of the binary colloidal array were explored. The empirical outcomes show that by employing the optimal processing conditions, binary colloidal arrays can be achieved by both the concurrent and sequential spin coating processes.},

ABSTRACT = {Rare-earth-based AB2-type compounds with Laves phase structure are readily subject to hydrogen-induced amorphization and disproportionation upon hydrogenation. In this work, we conducted the Sc alloying on Y0.95Ni2 to improve its hydrogen storage properties. The results show that the amorphization degree of Y0.95Ni2 deepens with the increasing hydrogenation time, pressure, and temperature. The Y(Sc)0.95Ni2 ternary compounds show a significant improvement in reversibility and dehydriding thermodynamics due to the reduced atomic radius ratio RA/RB and cell volume. Hydrogen-induced amorphization is fully eliminated in the Y0.25Sc0.7Ni2. The Y0.25Sc0.7Ni2 delivers a reversible hydrogen storage capacity of 0.94 wt.% and the dissociation pressure of 0.095 MPa at the minimum dehydrogenation temperature of 100 °C.},

ABSTRACT = {The grinding process has become widely used to improve the fineness and performance of fly ash. However, most studies focus on the particle size distribution of ground fly ash, while the particle morphology is also an important factor to affect the performance of cement paste. This article aims at three different kinds of ground fly ash from the ball mill and vertical mill, and the particle morphology is observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to calculate the spherical destruction (the ratio of spherical particles broken into irregular particles in the grinding process of fly ash), which provides a quantification of the morphology change in the grinding process. The fluidity of cement paste and the strength of cement mortar are tested to study the relation of spherical destruction and fluidity and strength. The results show that the spherical destruction of ground fly ash in a ball mill is more than 80% and that in a vertical mill with a separation system is only 11.9%. Spherical destruction shows a significant relation with the fluidity. To different addition of ground fly ash, the fluidity of cement paste decreases with the increase of spherical destruction. To the strength of cement paste, particle size distribution and spherical destruction are both the key factors. Therefore, spherical destruction is an important measurement index to evaluate the grinding effect of the fly ash mill.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper reports an independently tunable graphene-based metamaterial absorber (GMA) designed by etching two cascaded resonators with dissimilar sizes in the unit cell. Two perfect absorption peaks were obtained at 6.94 and 10.68 μm with simple single-layer metal-graphene metamaterials; the peaks show absorption values higher than 99%. The mechanism of absorption was analyzed theoretically. The independent tunability of the metamaterial absorber (MA) was realized by varying the Fermi level of graphene under a set of resonators. Furthermore, multi-band and wide-band absorption were observed by the proposed structure upon increasing the number of resonators and resizing them in the unit cell. The obtained results demonstrate the multipurpose performance of this type of absorber and indicate its potential application in diverse applications, such as solar energy harvesting and thermal absorbing.},

ABSTRACT = {Recovery of platinum group metals (PGM) from complex aqueous solutions generated as a result of leaching of various spent materials (e.g., spent automotive converters) is a vital issue in the context of the circular economy. In this study pyridinium derivatives containing an imidoamide or imine moiety (i.e., 3-[1-(2-ethylhexyloxyimine)methane]-1-propylpyridinium chloride, 3-[1-(decyloxyimine)methane]-1-propylpyridinium chloride, 3-[1-(decyloxyimine)ethane]-1-propylpyridinium chloride and 4-[1-amine(2-ethylhexyloxyimine)]-1-propylpyridinium chloride) are proposed as novel extractants for recovery of palladium(II) and platinum(IV) from model chloride aqueous solutions. The results of liquid-liquid extraction from one-component solutions of palladium(II) or platinum(IV) showed that quaternary pyridinium salts can be used as effective extractants for platinum metal ions. Moreover, PGM extraction from a two-component mixture proved no evident selectivity in the transfer of one of the metal ions to the organic phase. As the best extractant among the investigated ones, D3EI-PrCl (with straight alkyl chain at substituent) can be pointed out, however, problems with effective stripping or phase disengagement after stripping should be indicated as a drawback of the organic phases used. Further investigation should focus on the improvement of the organic phase properties (e.g., increase in hydrophobicity of the extractants and addition of an organic phase modifier) towards stripping efficiency.},

Anodic polarization studies, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy studies, morphological analysis, and Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy were performed on AZ31 Mg alloy after coating treatment in different concentrations of sodium selenite. The corrosion resistance was improved by around 5 times compared with control. Improved resistance to localized corrosion was observed in the coatings treated by 5 mM or 10 mM sodium selenite. The protection mechanism was ascribed to the transformation of selenite to insoluble selenium, the formation of insoluble MgSeO3 hydrate, and polymerization of amorphous selenium.},

ABSTRACT = {A novel high silicon austempered (AHS) steel has been studied in this work. The effect of different austenitizing temperatures, in full austenitic and biphasic regime, on the final microstructure was investigated. Specimens were austenitized at 780 °C, 830 °C, 850 °C and 900 °C for 30 min and held isothermally at 350 °C for 30 min. A second heat treatment route was performed which consisted of austenitizing at 900 °C for 30 min and austempering at 300 °C, 350 °C and 400 °C for 30 min. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) have been used to evaluate the microstructural evolution. These techniques revealed that the microstructures were composed of carbide-free bainite, ferrite, martensite and retained austenite (RA) in different volume fractions (Vγ). An aqueous borate buffer solution with 0.3 M H3BO3 and 0.075 M Na2B4O7∂10H2O (pH = 8.4) was used for corrosion tests in order to evaluate the influence of the different volume fractions of retained austenite on the corrosion properties of the specimens. The results showed that when increasing the austenitization temperatures, the volume fractions of retained austenite reached a maximum value at 850 °C, and decrease at higher temperatures. The corrosion properties were investigated after 30 min and 24 h immersion by means of potentiodynamic polarization (after 30 min) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (after both 30 min and 24 h) tests. The corrosion resistance of the samples increased with increases in the volume fraction of retained austenite due to lower amounts of residual stresses.},

ABSTRACT = {The vague influence of thermal action of electrical discharge on size distribution of metallic powders hinders the adjustability of powder quality. Due to the small gap, short discharge on-time, uncertain discharge point, and strong light interference, direct observation of preparation is difficult to carry out. Herein, the multi-physics coupling finite element method (FEM) was applied to numerically investigate the relationship between size distribution and thermal action. Through modeling of thermal transformation and heat distribution on the surface of electrode, temperature of the electrode is found to be decided by the latent heat and the distribution of heat point obeys the normal distribution, which corresponds with experimental results. Finally, the vapor film to droplet fragmentation theory was proposed to explain the phenomenon of normal distribution. The research results provide theoretical support for the preparation of metallic powder by electrical discharge, and also play a guiding role in optimizing the process parameters in the actual preparation process to tune the size distribution.},

ABSTRACT = {The bovine hoof wall with an α-keratin structure protects the bovine foot from impact loads when the cattle are running. Reduced modulus, hardness and creep behavior of the bovine hoof wall have been investigated by a nanoindentation technique. The average reduced modulus of the Transverse Direction (TD) specimens from the outside to inside wall is 3.76 and 2.05 GPa, respectively, while the average reduced modulus of the Longitudinal Direction (LD) specimens from the outside to inside wall is 4.54 and 3.22 GPa, respectively. Obviously, the orientation and the position of the bovine hoof wall have a significant influence on its mechanical properties. The use of the generalized Voigt–Kelvin model can make a good prediction of creep stage. Mechanical properties of the LD specimens are stronger than those of the TD specimens. The bovine hoof wall has a layered structure, which can effectively absorb the energy released by the crack propagation and passivate the crack tip. Therefore, a kind of structural model was designed and fabricated by three-dimensional printing technology, which has a 55% performance improvement on fracture toughness. It is believed that the reported results can be useful in the design of new bionic structure materials which may be used in motorcycle helmets and athletes’ protective equipment to achieve light weight and improved strength at the same time.},

ABSTRACT = {Co-bonding is an effective joining method for fiber-reinforced composites in which a prefabricated part bonds with a thermoset resin during the curing process. Manufacturing of co-bonded thermoset-thermoplastic hybrid composites is a challenging task due to the complexities of the interdiffusion of reactive thermoset resin and thermoplastic polymer at the interface between two plies. Herein, the interphase properties of co-bonded acrylonitrile butadiene styrene thermoplastic to unsaturated polyester thermoset are investigated for different processing conditions. The effect of processing temperature on the cure kinetics and interdiffusion kinetics are studied experimentally. The interphase thickness and microstructure are linked to the chemo-rheological properties of the materials. The interdiffusion mechanisms are explored and models are developed to predict the interphase thickness and microstructure for various process conditions. The temperature-dependent diffusivities were estimated by incorporating an inverse diffusion model. The mechanical response of interphases was analyzed by the Vickers microhardness test and was correlated to the processing condition and microstructure. It was observed that processing temperature has significant effect on the interdiffusion process and, consequently, on the interphase thickness, its microstructure and mechanical performance.},

ABSTRACT = {Zeta potential is frequently used to examine the colloidal stability of particles and macromolecules in liquids. Recently, it has been suggested that zeta potential can also play an important role for grouping and read-across of nanoforms in a regulatory context. Although the measurement of zeta potential is well established, only little information is reported on key metrological principles such as validation and measurement uncertainties. This contribution presents the results of an in-house validation of the commonly used electrophoretic light scattering (ELS) and the relatively new particle tracking analysis (PTA) methods. The performance characteristics were assessed by analyzing silica and polystyrene reference materials. The ELS and PTA methods are robust and have particle mass working ranges of 0.003 mg/kg to 30 g/kg and 0.03 mg/kg to 1.5 mg/kg, respectively. Despite different measurement principles, both methods exhibit similar uncertainties for repeatability (2%), intermediate precision (3%) and trueness (4%). These results confirm that the developed methods can accurately measure the zeta potential of silica and polystyrene particles and can be transferred to other laboratories that analyze similar types of samples. If direct implementation is impossible, the elaborated methodologies may serve as a guide to help laboratories validating their own methods.},

ABSTRACT = {In order to determine the potential environmental impact of construction products, it is necessary to evaluate their influence on organisms exposed to them or their eluates under environmental conditions. The behavior of the white worm Enchytraeus albidus is a useful tool for assessing the potential environmental impact of construction products in contact with water and soil. This study investigates the environmental effects of eluates from two construction products, a reactive waterproofing product, and an injection resin, on the reproduction and avoidance behavior of E. albidus. The eluates were prepared according to existing guidelines. The soil used for the tests was moistened with the eluates of the construction products. The reproduction results of the worms were collected after six weeks of exposure. Offsprings were counted under the microscope and statistically analyzed. Results from the avoidance behavior were collected after 48 h of exposure, and results were compared with the reproduction results. The eluates from both construction products induced significant changes in the reproduction behavior of E. albidus. Undiluted or only slightly diluted eluates of the injection resin drastically reduced the reproduction of the worms, whereas the leaches of the reactive waterproofing product only had a minor effect. The avoidance results for the injection resin indicates that its presence in the habitat is clearly detrimental to the survival of E. albidus, while the avoidance results for the waterproofing resin showed an initial avoidance of the eluates, but no harmful effects were observed. The avoidance test is a way of rapid toxicity screening of environmental samples when time is a critical parameter to measure possible environmental effects. This study shows that ecotoxicological tests using Enchytraeids are a valuable and important tool for understanding the mode of action of eluates from construction products in the environment.},

ABSTRACT = {In this work, loess-based materials were designed based on a multicomponent composite materials system for ecofriendly natural three-dimensional (3D) printing involving quick lime, gypsum, and water. The 3D printing process was monitored as a function of gypsum content; in terms of mechanical strength and electrical resistance, in the cube-shaped bulk form. After initial optimization, the 3D printing composition was refined to provide improved printability in a 3D printing system. The optimal 3D fabrication allowed for reproducible printing of rectangular columns and cubes. The development of 3D printing materials was scrutinized using a multitude of physicochemical probing tools, including X-ray diffraction for phase identification, impedance spectroscopy to monitor setting behaviors, and mercury intrusion porosimetry to extract the pore structure of loess-based composite materials. Additionally, the setting behavior in the loess-based composite materials was analyzed by investigating the formation of gypsum hydrates induced by chemical reaction between quick lime and water. This setting reaction provides reasonable mechanical strength that is sufficient to print loess-based pastes via 3D printing. Such mechanical strength allows utilization of robotic 3D printing applications that can be used to fabricate ecofriendly structures.},

ABSTRACT = {A concrete-filled steel tube (CFT) combines the advantages of concrete and steel in construction and structural applications. However, research on the time-dependent deformation of the CFT under long-term sustained loading are still limited, particularly for stress transfer between the steel tube and concrete due to creep. This study investigated the creep behavior of CFT over a long period of 400 days. The creep and shrinkage strain of CFT was significantly lower than those of concrete that was not confined within a steel tube. The vertical strains of the steel tube and concrete core were almost identical, and it was shown that they were well bonded and acted as a composite. The vertical stress of steel increased by 32.7%, whereas the vertical stress of concrete decreased by 15.8% at 375 days. The stress transfer is notable and cannot be neglected in CFT design. Moreover, the results of creep and shrinkage were compared to prediction values of the B4 model and B4-TW model to verify their validity.},

ABSTRACT = {One of the key components of the designing procedure of a structure of hard anti-wear coatings deposited via Physical Vapour Deposition (PVD) is the analysis of the stress and strain distributions in the substrate/coating systems, initiated during the deposition process and by external mechanical loads. Knowledge of residual stress development is crucial due to their significant influence on the mechanical and tribological properties of such layer systems. The main goal of the work is to find the optimal functionally graded material (FGM) coating’s structure, composed of three functional layers: (1) adhesive layer, providing high adhesion of the coating to the substrate, (2) gradient load support and crack deflection layer, improving hardness and enhancing fracture toughness, (3) wear-resistant top layer, reducing wear. In the optimisation procedure of the coating’s structure, seven decision criteria basing on the state of residual stresses and strains in the substrate/coating system were proposed. Using finite element simulations and postulated criteria, the thickness and composition gradients of the transition layer in FGM coating were determined. In order to verify the proposed optimisation procedure, Zr-C coatings with different spatial distribution of carbon concentration were produced by the Reactive Magnetron Sputtering PVD (RMS PVD) method and their anti-wear properties were assessed by scratch test and ball-on-disc tribological test.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper presents the experimental results of composite rebars based on GFRP manufactured by a pultrusion system. The bending and radial compression strength of rods was determined. The elastic modulus of GFRP rebars is significantly lower than for steel rebars, while the static flexural properties are higher. The microstructure of the selected rebars was studied and discussed in light of the obtained results—failure processes such as the delamination and fibers fracture can be observed. The bending fatigue test was performed under a constant load amplitude sinusoidal waveform. All rebars were subjected to fatigue tests under the R = 0.1 condition. As a result, the S-N curve was obtained, and basic fatigue characteristics were determined. The fatigue mechanism of bar failure under bending was further analyzed using SEM microscopy. It is worth noting that the failure and fracture mechanism plays a crucial role as a material quality indicator in the manufacturing process. The main mechanism of failure under static and cyclic loading during the bending test is widely discussed in this paper. The results obtained from fatigue tests encourage further analysis. The diametral compression test reflects the weakest nature of the composite materials based on the interlaminar compressive strength. The proposed methodology allows us to invariantly describe the experimental transversal strength of the composite materials. Considering the expected durability of the structure, the failure mechanism is likely to significantly improve their fatigue behavior under the influence of cyclic bending. The reasonable direction of searching for reinforcements of composite structures should be the improvement of the bearing capacity of the outer layers. In comparison with steel rebars (fatigue tensile test), the obtained results for GFRP are comparable in the HCF regime. It is worth noting that in the near fatigue endurance regime (2–5 × 106 cycles) both rebars exhibit similar behavior.},

ABSTRACT = {The morphology of nanomaterials may affect their interaction with biomacromolecules such as proteins. Previous work has studied the size-dependent binding of pristine nC60 to bovine/human serum albumin using the fluorometric method and found that the fluorescence inner filter effect might affect this interaction. However, if it is necessary to accurately calculate and obtain binding information, the fluorescence inner filter effect should not be ignored. This work aimed to further investigate the effect of the fluorescence inner filter on the interaction between pristine nC60 with different particle sizes (140–160, 120–140, 90–110, 50–70, and 30–50 nm) and bovine serum albumin for a more accurate comprehension of the binding of pristine nC60 to bovine serum albumin. The nC60 nanoparticles with different size distributions used in the experiments were obtained by the solvent displacement and centrifugation method. UV-Vis spectroscopy and fluorescence spectroscopy were used to study the binding of nC60 with different size distributions to bovine serum albumin (BSA) before and after eliminating the fluorescence inner filter effect. The results showed that the fluorescence inner filter effect had an influence on the interaction between nC60 and proteins to some extent, and still did not change the rule of the size-dependent binding of nC60 nanoparticles to BSA. Further studies on the binding parameters (binding constants and the number of binding sites) between them were performed, and the effect of the binding on BSA structures and conformation were also speculated.},

ABSTRACT = {The level of the properties of bituminous mixtures produced with water foamed bitumen relies on the optimum characteristics of the bitumen. One way to achieve the desired characteristics is to modify the bitumen with chemical additives before it is foamed. Bitumen 50/70 treated with a surface-active agent (SAA) at 0.2%, 0.4% and 0.6% and Fischer–Tropsch (F–T) synthetic wax at 1.5%, 2.0%, 2.5% and 3.0% was used in the tests. The effect of the modifiers was investigated by assessing bitumen properties (penetration, softening point, Fraass breaking point and dynamic viscosity at 60 °C, 90 °C and 135 °C) and foam parameters (maximum expansion—ER, half-life—HL). For statistical evaluation of the test results, models of the properties of bitumen 50/70 were developed as a function of the contents of F–T synthetic wax and SAA. It was found that 2.0% F–T wax and 0.6% SAA were optimum contents for achieving the desired standard properties and foam characteristics of the tested binder. The developed models allow determining the composition of the modified binder depending on the required foam characteristics for specific applications in road construction. The recommended composition of the chemical additives used to modify the binder was also established to ensure its optimum properties.},

ABSTRACT = {Modified cokes with improved resistance to CO2 reaction were produced from a high volatile coking coal (HVC) and different concentrations of boron carbide (B4C) in a laboratory scale coking furnace. This paper focuses on modification mechanism about the influence of B4C on coking behavior and chemical structure during HVC carbonization. The former was studied by using a thermo-gravimetric analyzer. For the latter, four semi-cokes prepared from carbonization tests for HVC with or without B4C at 450 °C and 750 °C, respectively, were analyzed by using Fourier transform infrared spectrum and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy technologies. It was found that B4C will retard extensive condensation and crosslinking reactions by reducing the amount of active oxygen obtained from thermally produced free radicals and increase secondary cracking reactions, resulting in increasing size of aromatic layer and anisotropic degree in coke structure, which eventually improves the coke quality.},

ABSTRACT = {Electrical Discharge Machining (EDM) consists of a non-conventional machining process, which is widely used in modern industry, and especially in machining hard-to-cut materials. By employing EDM, complex shapes and geometries can be produced, with high dimensional accuracy. Titanium alloys, due to their unique inherent properties, are extensively utilized in high end applications. Nevertheless, they suffer from poor machinability, and thus, EDM is commonly employed for their machining. The current study presents an experimental investigation regarding the process of Ti–6Al–4V ELI with high power EDM, using a graphite electrode. Control parameters were the pulse-on current (Ip) and time (Ton), while Machining performances were estimated in terms of Material Removal Rate (MRR), Tool Material Removal Rate (TMRR), and Tool Wear Ratio (TWR). The machined Surface Roughness was calculated according to the Ra and the Rt values, by following the ISO 25178-2 standards. Furthermore, the EDMed surfaces were observed under optical and SEM microscopy, while their cross sections were also studied in order the Average White Layer Thickness (AWLT) and the Heat Affected Zone (HAZ) to be measured. Finally, for the aforementioned indexes, Analysis Of Variance was performed, whilst for the MRR and TMRR, based on the Response Surface Method (RSM), semi-empirical correlations were presented. The scope of the current paper is, through a series of experiments and by employing statistical tools, to present how two main machining parameters, i.e., pulse-on current and time, affect major machining performance indexes and the surface roughness.},

ABSTRACT = {Environmental considerations and technical benefits have directed research towards reducing cement clinker content in concrete, and one of the best ways to do this is to replace cement with supplementary cementitious materials. High calcium fly ash, ladle furnace slag, and limestone filler were investigated as supplementary cementitious materials in cement pastes, and binary mixtures were produced at 10%, 20%, and 30% cement replacement rates for each material. The water requirement for maximum packing and for normal consistency were obtained for each paste, and strength development was determined at 3, 7, 28, and 90 days for the 20% replacement rate. Furthermore, two ternary mixtures at 30% cement replacement were also prepared for maximum packing density and tested for compressive strength development. The results showed that high calcium fly ash decreased cement paste packing and increased water demand but contributed to strength development through reactivity. Ladle furnace slag and limestone filler, on the other hand, were less reactive and seemed to contribute to strength development through the filler effect. The ternary paste with 70% cement, 20% high calcium fly ash, and 10% limestone filler showed equivalent strength development to that of the reference cement paste.},

ABSTRACT = {Tools and machine surfaces are subjected to various types of damage caused by many different factors. Due to this, the protecting coatings characterized by the best properties for a given treatment or environment are used. AlCrN coatings with different compositions, synthesized by different methods, are often of interest to scientists. The aim of the presented work was the deposition and investigation of two sets of coatings: (1) formed in nitrogen pressure from 0.8 Pa to 5 Pa and (2) formed at arc current from 50 A to 100 A. We study relationships between the above technological parameters and discuss their properties. Coatings formed at nitrogen pressure (pN2) up to 3 Pa crystallize both in hexagonal AlN structure and the cubic CrN structure. For pN2 > 3 Pa, they crystallize in the CrN cubic structure. Crystallite size increases with nitrogen pressure. The coatings formed at different arc currents have a cubic CrN structure and the crystallite size is independent of the current. The adhesion of the coatings is very good, independent of nitrogen pressure and arc current.},

ABSTRACT = {The use of hydraulic silicate cements (HSCs) for vital pulp therapy has been found to release calcium and hydroxyl ions promoting pulp tissue healing and mineralized tissue formation. The present study investigated whether HSCs such as mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) affect their biological and antimicrobial properties when used as long-term pulp protection materials. The effect of variables on treatment outcomes of three HSCs (ProRoot MTA, OrthoMTA, and RetroMTA) was evaluated clinically and radiographically over a 48–78 month follow-up period. Survival analysis was performed using Kaplan–Meier survival curves. Fisher’s exact test and Cox regression analysis were used to determine hazard ratios of clinical variables. The overall success rate of MTA partial pulpotomy was 89.3%; Cumulative success rates of the three HSCs were not statistically different when analyzed by Cox proportional hazard regression analysis. None of the investigated clinical variables affected success rates significantly. These HSCs showed favorable biocompatibility and antimicrobial properties in partial pulpotomy of permanent teeth in long-term follow-up, with no statistical differences between clinical factors.},

ABSTRACT = {Existing buildings, especially historical buildings, require periodic or situational diagnostic tests. If a building is in use, advanced non-destructive or semi-destructive methods should be used. In the diagnosis of reinforced concrete structures, tests allowing to assess the condition of the reinforcement and concrete cover are particularly important. The article presents non-destructive and semi-destructive research methods that are used for such tests, as well as the results of tests performed for selected elements of a historic water tower structure. The assessment of the corrosion risk of the reinforcement was carried out with the use of a semi-destructive galvanostatic pulse method. The protective properties of the concrete cover were checked by the carbonation test and the phase analysis of the concrete. X-ray diffractometry and thermal analysis methods were used for this. In order to determine the position of the reinforcement and to estimate the concrete cover thickness distribution, a ferromagnetic detection system was used. The comprehensive application of several test methods allowed mutual verification of the results and the drawing of reliable conclusions. The results indicated a very poor state of the reinforcement, loss in the depth of cover and sulphate corrosion.},

ABSTRACT = {In this work, the deformation behaviour of a twin-roll cast (TRC) Mg-6.8Y-2.5Zn-0.4Zr alloy during plane strain compression was characterised by high-temperature testing. Based on the experimental data, the values of strain-rate sensitivity, the efficiency of power dissipation and the instability parameter were investigated under the conditions of various hot deformation parameters. In contrast to conventionally cast material, no lamellae of the LPSO (long period stacking ordered) phase were precipitated in the magnesium matrix after TRC. The precipitation of fine lamellar LPSO phases only occurred during cooling to forming temperature after the heat treatment. Dynamic recrystallization (DRX) hardly occurred during deformation at temperatures between 350 °C and 400 °C. This can be attributed to the precipitation of the lamellar LSPO phases, which contribute to retardation of the DRX process. At higher deformation temperatures and strain rates DRX is pronounced and the twin-induced (TRDX) as well as continuous dynamic recrystallization could be identified as the dominant softening mechanisms. The processing maps were established by superimposing the instability map over the power dissipation map, this being associated with microstructural evolution analysis in the hot deformation processes. Two instability zones could be recognised for the twin-roll cast and heat-treated Mg-6.8Y-2.5Zn-0.4Zr alloy: (1) 350 °C to 460 °C and 0.01 s−1 to 0.3 s−1 and (2) 485 °C to 525 °C and 2.5 s−1 to 10 s−1, where deformation is not favourable.},

In this study, we incorporated polyaniline (PANi) in a poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) hydrogel matrix through UV-induced photolithography with photomasks, and electrically conductive hydrogel micropatterns were generated within a few seconds. The electrical conductance of the PANi/PEG hydrogel was 30.5 ± 0.5 mS/cm. C2C12 myoblasts were cultured on the resulting substrate, and the cells adhered selectively to the PANi/PEG hydrogel regions. Myogenic differentiation of the C2C12 cells was induced, and the alignment of myotubes was consistent with the arrangement of the line pattern. The expression of myosin heavy chain on the line pattern showed potential as a substrate for myogenic cell functionalization.},

ABSTRACT = {This study employs first-principles calculations to investigate how introducing Yb into aluminum nitride (AlN) leads to a large enhancement in the material’s piezoelectric response (d33). The maximum d33 is calculated to be over 100 pC/N, which is 20 times higher than that of AlN. One reason for such a significant improvement in d33 is the elastic-softening effect, which is indicated by a decrease in the elastic constant, C33. The strain sensitivity (du/dε) of the internal parameter, u, is also an important factor for improving the piezoelectric stress constant, e33. On the basis of mixing enthalpy calculations, YbxAl1−xN is predicted to be more stable as a wurtzite phase than as a rock salt phase at composition up to x ≈ 0.7. These results suggest that Yb can be doped into AlN at high concentrations. It was also observed that the dielectric constant, ε33, generally increases with increasing Yb concentrations. However, the electromechanical coupling coefficient, k332, only increases up to x = 0.778, which is likely because of the relatively lower values of ε33 within this range.},

ABSTRACT = {Four types of ultra-low carbon bainite (ULCB) steels were obtained using unified production methods to investigate solely the effect of niobium content on the performance of ULCB steels. Tensile testing, low-temperature impact toughness testing, corrosion weight-loss method, polarization curves, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and the corresponding organizational observations were realized. The results indicate that the microstructure of the four steels comprise granular bainite and quite a few martensite/austenite (M/A) elements. The niobium content affects bainite morphology and the size, quantity, and distribution of M/A elements. The elongation, yield strength, and tensile strength of the four types of ULCB steels are above 20%, 500 MPa, and 650 MPa, respectively. The impact toughness of the four types of ULCB steels at −40 °C is lower than 10 J. Steel with Nb content of 0.0692% has better comprehensive property, and maximum charge transfer resistance in 3.5 wt.% NaCl solution at the initial corrosion stage. The corrosion products on the surface of steel with higher niobium content are much smoother and denser than those steel with lower niobium content after 240 h of corrosion. The degree of corrosion decreases gradually with the increase of niobium content at the later stage of corrosion.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper presents a uniquely designed device combining the hole-drilling technique with two optical systems based on the PhotoStress and digital image correlation (DIC) method, where the digital image correlation system moves with the cutting tool. The authors aimed to verify whether the accuracy of the drilled hole according to ASTM E837-13a standard and the positioning accuracy of the device were sufficient to achieve accurate results. The experimental testing was performed on a thin specimen made from strain sensitive coating PS-1D, which allowed comparison of the results obtained by both methods. Although application of the PhotoStress method allows analysis of the strains at the edge of the cut hole, it requires a lot of experimenter’s practical skills to assess the results correctly. On the other hand, the DIC method allows digital processing of the measured data. However, the problem is not only to determine the data at the edge of the hole, the results also significantly depend on the smoothing levels used. The quantitative comparison of the results obtained was performed using finite element analysis.},

ABSTRACT = {A facile and environmentally friendly fabrication is proposed to prepare nitrogen-doped hierarchical porous activated carbon via normal-pressure popping, one-pot activation and nitrogen-doping process. The method adopts paddy as carbon precursor, KHCO3 and dicyandiamide as the safe activating agent and nitrogen dopant. The as-prepared activated carbon presents a large specific surface area of 3025 m2·g−1 resulting from the synergistic effect of KHCO3 and dicyandiamide. As an electrode material, it shows a maximum specific capacitance of 417 F·g−1 at a current density of 1 A·g−1 and very good rate performance. Furthermore, the assembled symmetric supercapacitor presents a large specific capacitance of 314.6 F·g−1 and a high energy density of 15.7 Wh·Kg−1 at 1 A·g−1, maintaining 14.4 Wh·Kg−1 even at 20 A·g−1 with the energy density retention of 91.7%. This research demonstrates that nitrogen-doped hierarchical porous activated carbon derived from paddy has a significant potential for developing a high-performance renewable supercapacitor and provides a new route for economical and large-scale production in supercapacitor application.},

The research included an evaluation of mechanical parameters of concrete containing noncondensed silica fume (SF) in an amount of 10% and siliceous fly ash (FA) in the following amounts: 0%, 10% and 20%. The experiments were carried out on mature specimens, i.e., after 28 days of curing and specimens at an early age, i.e., after 3 and 7 days of curing. In the course of experiments, the effect of adding SF to the value of the critical stress intensity factor—KIcS in FA concretes in different periods of curing were evaluated. In addition, the basic strength parameters of concrete composites, i.e., compressive strength—fcm and splitting tensile strength—fctm, were measured. A novelty in the presented research is the evaluation of the fracture toughness of concretes with two mineral additives, assessed at an early age. During the tests, the structures of all composites and the nature of macroscopic crack propagation were also assessed. A modern and useful digital image correlation (DIC) technique was used to assess macroscopic cracks. Based on the conducted research, it was found the application of SF to FA concretes contributes to a significant increase in the fracture toughness of these materials at an early age. Moreover, on the basis of the obtained test results, it was found that the values of the critical stress intensity factor of analyzed concretes were convergent qualitatively with their strength parameters. It also has been demonstrated that in the first 28 days of concrete curing, the preferred solution is to replace cement with SF in the amount of 10% or to use a cement binder substitution with a combination of additives in proportions 10% SF + 10% FA. On the other hand, the composition of mineral additives in proportions 10% SF + 20% FA has a negative effect on the fracture mechanics parameters of concretes at an early age. Based on the analysis of the results of microstructural tests and the evaluation of the propagation of macroscopic cracks, it was established that along with the substitution of the cement binder with the combination of mineral additives, the composition of the cement matrix in these composites changes, which implies a different, i.e., quasi-plastic, behavior in the process of damage and destruction of the material.},

ABSTRACT = {This work presents some breakthroughs for obtaining high dimensional accuracy and reliable geometrical tolerance in the joining of stainless-steel powders with heterogeneous substrates. In the laser melting process, the interfacial energy fractions and forces acting at the solid–liquid surface of the melting powders can effectively vary their geometrical shapes and positions before they turn into the liquid phase. When the interfacial free energy is low, the melting powders are near molten, thus the successive volumetric changes can alter the layered geometry and positions. This assumption was validated by a powder-bedding additive manufacturing process to consolidate stainless-steel 316L powders (SLM 316L) on a thin heterogeneous stainless-steel substrate. Experiments were carried out to reveal the effects of the process parameters, such as laser power (100–200 W), exposure duration (50–100 µs) and point distance (35–70 µm) on the resulting material density and porosity and the corresponding dimensional variations. A fractional factorial design of experiment was proposed and the results of which were analyzed statistically using analysis of variances (ANOVA) to identify the influence of each operating factor. High energy densities are required to achieve materials of high density (7.71 g/cm3) or low porosity (3.15%), whereas low energy densities are preferable when the objective is dimensional accuracy (0.016 mm). Thermally induced deflections (~0.108 mm) in the heterogeneous metal substrate were analyzed using curvature plots. Thermally induced deformations can be attributed to volumetric energy density, scanning strategy, and the lay-up orientation. The parametric optimizations for increasing in dimensional accuracy (Z1: ~0.105 mm), or in material density (~7.71 g/cm3) were proven with high conversion rates of 88.2% and 96.4%, respectively, in validation runs.},

ABSTRACT = {Currently, up to 215 million metric tons of harvestable straw are available in Europe, 50% of the crops come from wheat, 25% from barley and 25% from maize. More than half of the production remains undeveloped. The overproduction of straw in the world means that the current methods of its management are insufficient. The article describes the production method and characterization of natural rubber biocomposites containing cereal straw powder modified with functional nano-additives in the form of carbon black, silica and halloysite nanotubes. The use of cereal straw in the elastomer matrix should contribute to obtaining a product with good mechanical properties while ensuring a low cost of the composite. In turn, the application of the mechanical modification process will allow the combination of specific properties of raw materials to obtain new, advanced elastomeric materials. As part of the work, hybrid fillers based on mechanically modified cereal straw were produced. The impact of hybrid fillers on mechanical, rheometric and damping properties was assessed. The flammability and susceptibility of the obtained biocomposites to aging processes were determined. The use of hybrid fillers based on mechanically modified straw allowed us to obtain a higher cross-linking density of vulcanizates (even up to 40% compared to the reference sample), and thus higher values of the rheometric moment during the vulcanization process of rubber mixtures (from approx. 10% (10 phr of filler) up to 50% (30 phr of filler) in relation to the unfilled system) and higher hardness of vulcanizates (by about 30–70%). The curing time of the blends was slightly longer, but the obtained composites were characterized by significantly higher tensile strength. The use of fillers in the elastomer matrix increased the modulus at 100, 200 and 300% and the elongation at break. Moreover, greater resistance of vulcanizates to the combustion process was confirmed.},

ABSTRACT = {A graphene oxide aerogel (GOA) was formed inside a melamine sponge (MS) framework. After reduction with hydrazine at 60 °C, the electrical conductive nitrogen-enriched rGOA-MS composite material with a specific density of 20.1 mg/cm3 was used to fabricate an electrode, which proved to be a promising electrocatalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction. The rGOA-MS composite material was characterized by elemental analysis, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy. It was found that nitrogen in the material is presented by different types with the maximum concentration of pyrrole-like nitrogen. By using Raman scattering it was established that the rGOA component of the material is graphene-like carbon with an average size of the sp2-domains of 5.7 nm. This explains a quite high conductivity of the composite obtained.},

ABSTRACT = {Transparent fluorotellurite glasses were prepared by melt-quenching in the ternary system TeO2-Nb2O5-PbF2. The synthesis conditions were adjusted to minimize fluorine loss monitored as HF release. It was found that 10 mol% of Nb2O5 is the optimum content for PbF2 incorporation up to 35 mol% in the tellurite matrix without loss of glass forming ability. Such glass compositions exhibit a wide optical window from 380 nm to about 6 μm. Crystallization properties were carefully investigated by thermal analysis and compositions with higher PbF2 contents exhibit preferential precipitation of lead oxyfluoride Pb2OF2 at lower temperatures. The lead oxyfluoride crystallization mechanism is also governed by a volume nucleation, barely reported in tellurite glasses. Eu3+ doping of these glass compositions also promotes a more efficient nucleation step under suitable heat-treatments, resulting in transparent Eu3+-doped glass-ceramics whereas undoped glass-ceramics are translucent. Finally, Eu3+ spectroscopy pointed out a progressive, more symmetric surrounding around the rare earth ions with increasing PbF2 contents as well as higher quantum efficiencies. These new fluorotellurite glass compositions are promising as luminescent hosts working in the middle infrared.},

ABSTRACT = {Lately, in orthodontic treatments, the use of transparent aligners for the correction of malocclusions has become prominent owing to their intrinsic advantages such as esthetics, comfort, and minimal maintenance. Attempts at improving upon this technology by varying various parameters to investigate the effects on treatments have been carried out by several researchers. Here, we aimed to investigate the biomechanical and clinical effects of aligner thickness on stress distributions in the periodontal ligament and changes in the tooth’s center of rotation. Dental finite element models comprising the cortical and cancellous bones, gingiva, teeth, and nonlinear viscoelastic periodontal ligaments were constructed, validated, and used together with aligner finite element models of different aligner thicknesses to achieve the goal of this study. The finite element analyses were conducted to simulate the actual orthodontic aligner treatment process for the correction of malocclusions by generating pre-stresses in the aligner and allowing the aligner stresses to relax to induce tooth movement. The results of the analyses showed that orthodontic treatment in lingual inclination and axial rotation with a 0.75 mm-thick aligner resulted in 6% and 0.03% higher principal stresses in the periodontal ligament than the same treatment using a 0.05 mm-thick aligner, respectively. Again, for both aligner thicknesses, the tooth’s center of rotation moved lingually and towards the root direction in lingual inclination, and diagonally from the long axis of the tooth in axial rotation. Taken together, orthodontic treatment for simple malocclusions using transparent aligners of different thicknesses will produce a similar effect on the principal stresses in the periodontal ligament and similar changes in the tooth’s center of rotation, as well as sufficient tooth movement. These findings provide orthodontists and researchers clinical and biomechanical evidence about the effect of transparent aligner thickness selection and its effect on orthodontic treatment.},

This regards also, for instance, nets used for agricultural product (e.g., citrus fruits, potatoes) packaging. These nets are typically manufactured by film blowing technique, with subsequent slicing of the films and cold drawing of the obtained strips, made from traditional, non-biodegradable polymer systems. In this work, two biodegradable polymer systems were characterized from rheological, processability, and mechanical points of view, in order to evaluate their suitability to replace polyethylene-based polymer systems typically used for agricultural product net manufacturing. Furthermore, laboratory simulation of the above-mentioned processing operation paths was performed. The results indicated a good potential for biodegradable polymer systems to replace polyethylene-based systems for agricultural product packaging.},

ABSTRACT = {We investigated whether low transformation temperature (LTT) welding materials are beneficial to the generation of compressive residual stress around a weld zone, thus enhancing the fatigue performance of the welded joint. An experimental and numerical study were conducted in order to analyze the residual stress in multi-pass T-welded joints using LTT welding wire. It was found that, compared to the conventional welded joint, greater tensile residual stress was induced in the flange plate of the LTT welded joints. This was attributed to the reheat temperature of the LTT weld pass during the multi-pass welding. The formerly-formed LTT weld pass with a reheat temperature lower than the austenite finish temperature converted the compressive residual stress into tensile stress. The compressive residual stress was generated in the regions with a reheat temperature higher than the austenite finish temperature, indicating that LTT welding materials are more suitable for single-pass welding.},

ABSTRACT = {With the rapid development of on-chip optics, integrated optical devices with better performance are desirable. Waveguide couplers are the typical integrated optical devices, allowing for the fast transmission and conversion of optical signals in a broad working band. However, traditional waveguide couplers are limited by the narrow operation band to couple the spatial light into the chip and the fixed unidirectional transmission of light flow. Furthermore, most of the couplers only realize unidirectional transmission under the illumination of the linear polarized light. In this work, a broadband polarization directional coupler based on a metallic catenary antenna integrated on a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) waveguide has been designed and demonstrated under the illumination of the circularly polarized light. By applying the genetic algorithm to optimize the multiple widths of the metallic catenary antenna, the numerical simulation results show that the extinction ratio of the coupler can be maintained larger than 18 dB in a wide operation band of 300 nm (from 1400 to 1700 nm). Moreover, the coupler can couple the spatial beam into the plane and transmit in the opposite direction by modulating the rotation direction of the incident light. The broadband polarization directional coupler might have great potential in integrated optoelectronic devices and on-chip optical devices.},

ABSTRACT = {Small additive molecules often enhance structural relaxation in polymers. We explore this effect in a thermoplastic shape memory polymer via molecular dynamics simulations. The additive-to-monomer size ratio is shown to play a key role here. While the effect of additive-concentration on the rate of shape recovery is found to be monotonic in the investigated range, a non-monotonic dependence on the size-ratio emerges at temperatures close to the glass transition. This work thus identifies the additives’ size to be a qualitatively novel parameter for controlling the recovery process in polymer-based shape memory materials.},

ABSTRACT = {This article is an evaluation of the phenomena occurring in adhesive joints during curing and their consequences. Considering changes in the values of Young’s modulus distributed along the joint thickness, and potential changes in adhesive strength in the cured state, the use of a numerical model may make it possible to improve finite element simulation effects and bring their results closer to experimental data. The results of a tensile test of a double overlap adhesive joint sample, performed using an extensometer, are presented. This test allowed for the precise determination of the shear modulus G of the cured adhesive under experimental conditions. Then, on the basis of the research carried out so far, a numerical model was built, taking the differences observed in the properties of the joint material into account. The stress distribution in a three-zone adhesive joint was analyzed in comparison to the standard numerical model in which the adhesive in the joint was treated as isotropic. It is proposed that a joint model with three-zones, differing in the Young’s modulus values, is more accurate for mapping the experimental results.},

ABSTRACT = {This study investigated the influence of rice straw ash (RSA), rice husk ash (RHA), and silica fume (SF) on alkali activated slag (AAS) systems. RSA, RHA, and SF were treated with sodium hydroxide to improve their reactivity in AAS systems. Although addition of SF in AAS systems increased compressive strength, samples containing RSA or RHA had higher compressive strength than those having SF. Treated RSA or RHA further increased compressive strength of AAS samples. It was shown that samples containing treated ash samples had similar compressive strength to those made with sodium silica activator. Therefore, it is suggested that treated ash samples could be used as alternative sources of silica for AAS. Drying shrinkage of AAS samples increased considerably when treated RSA or RHA were used as partial replacement of slag. This could be attributed to higher silica modulus (SiO2/Na2O) ratio of samples containing treated ash, which in turn would lead to a finer pore size structure compared to control samples. However, SF significantly reduced drying shrinkage of AAS. This could be because SF reduces the permeability and porosity of AAS samples.},

ABSTRACT = {The Al-20Si-5Fe-3Cu-1Mg alloy was fabricated using selective laser melting (SLM). The microstructure and properties of the as-prepared SLM, post-treated SLM, and SLM with substrate plate heating are studied. The as-prepared SLM sample shows a non-uniform microstructure with four different phases: fcc-αAl, eutectic Al-Si, Al2MgSi, and δ-Al4FeSi2. With thermal treatment, the phases become coarser and the δ-Al4FeSi2 phase transforms partially to β-Al5FeSi. The sample produced with SLM substrate plate heating shows a relatively uniform microstructure without a distinct difference between hatch overlaps and track cores. Room temperature compression test results show that an as-prepared SLM sample reaches a maximum strength (862 MPa) compared to the heat-treated (524 MPa) and substrate plate heated samples (474 MPa) due to the presence of fine microstructure and the internal stresses. The reduction in strength of the sample produced with substrate plate heating is due to the coarsening of the microstructure, but the plastic deformation shows an improvement (20%). The present observations suggest that substrate plate heating can be effectively employed not only to minimize the internal stresses (by impacting the cooling rate of the process) but can also be used to modulate the mechanical properties in a controlled fashion.},

ABSTRACT = {The presented results are an attempt to identify the changes taking place during a punch test experiment and the development of fungal impurities of powdered food materials over long-term storage at 75% RH. The potato starch and wheat flour market has a large share of the global production of bulk materials. The growing interest in powdered food materials requires additional production expenditure. This is associated with an increase in storage time of the discussed product and providing it with the appropriate conditions. The samples of potato starch and wheat flour were stored in perforated containers in a climatic chamber at 75% humidity and 21 °C for five months and then samples were measured by a punch test in a Lloyd LRX materials testing machine. The graphs obtained in the potato starch punch test differed significantly from wheat flour. The thickening of potato starch was observed in the form of layers, while potato starch was uniformly thickened throughout the experiment. The conditions of 75% humidity and 21 °C can be described as the beginning of the caking process. In potato starch, linear sections were observed, which changed the length of their storage time and, additionally, was correlated with the appearance of fungal contamination. These results may suggest the influence of fungi on the phenomenon of bulk material caking.},

ABSTRACT = {The influence of errors in the processes of detection and then reduction of surface topography measurement noise is of great importance; many research papers are concerned with the definition of this type of measurement error. This paper presents the influence of high-frequency measurement noise, defined for various types of surface textures, e.g., two-process plateau-honed, turned, ground, or isotropic. Procedures for the processing of raw measured data as a detection of the high-frequency errors from the results of surface topography measurements were proposed and verified (compared) according to the commonly used (available in the commercial software of the measuring equipment) algorithms. It was assumed that commonly used noise-separation algorithms did not always provide consistent results for two process textures with the valley-extraction analysis; as a result, some free-of-dimple (part of the analyzed detail where dimples do not exist) areas were not carefully considered. Moreover, the influence of measured data processing errors on surface topography parameter calculation was not comprehensively studied with high-frequency measurement noise assessments. It was assumed that the application of the Wavelet Noise Extraction Procedure (WNEP) might be exceedingly valuable when the reduction of a disparate range of measured frequencies (measurement noise) was carefully considered.},

XRD pattern-evidenced SiC generated by pyrolysis of polycarbosilane (PCS) was mainly composed by 2H-SiC and 4H-SiC, both belonging to α-SiC. Micron-level ZrB2 secondary phase was observed inside the (SiC-AlN)/ZrB2 composite, while the mean grain size (MGS) of SiC-AlN matrix was approximately 97 nm. This unique nano-micron hybrid microstructure enhanced the mechanical properties. The present investigation provided a feasible tactic for strengthening ceramics from PDCs raw materials.},

ABSTRACT = {The effects of Ag nanoparticle (Ag NP) addition on interfacial reaction and mechanical properties of Sn–58Bi solder joints using ultra-fast laser soldering were investigated. Laser-assisted low-temperature bonding was used to solder Sn–58Bi based pastes, with different Ag NP contents, onto organic surface preservative-finished Cu pads of printed circuit boards. The solder joints after laser bonding were examined to determine the effects of Ag NPs on interfacial reactions and intermetallic compounds (IMCs) and high-temperature storage tests performed to investigate its effects on the long-term reliabilities of solder joints. Their mechanical properties were also assessed using shear tests. Although the bonding time of the laser process was shorter than that of a conventional reflow process, Cu–Sn IMCs, such as Cu6Sn5 and Cu3Sn, were well formed at the interface of the solder joint. The addition of Ag NPs also improved the mechanical properties of the solder joints by reducing brittle fracture and suppressing IMC growth. However, excessive addition of Ag NPs degraded the mechanical properties due to coarsened Ag3Sn IMCs. Thus, this research predicts that the laser bonding process can be applied to low-temperature bonding to reduce thermal damage and improve the mechanical properties of Sn–58Bi solders, whose microstructure and related mechanical properties can be improved by adding optimal amounts of Ag NPs.},
