In this work, a (SiC-AlN)/ZrB2 composite with outstanding mechanical properties was prepared by using polymer-derived ceramics (PDCs) and hot-pressing technique. Flexural strength reached up to 460 ± 41 MPa, while AlN and ZrB2 contents were 10 wt%, and 15 wt%, respectively, under a hot-pressing temperature of 2000 °C. XRD pattern-evidenced SiC generated by pyrolysis of polycarbosilane (PCS) was mainly composed by 2H-SiC and 4H-SiC, both belonging to α-SiC. Micron-level ZrB2 secondary phase was observed inside the (SiC-AlN)/ZrB2 composite, while the mean grain size (MGS) of SiC-AlN matrix was approximately 97 nm. This unique nano-micron hybrid microstructure enhanced the mechanical properties. The present investigation provided a feasible tactic for strengthening ceramics from PDCs raw materials.
