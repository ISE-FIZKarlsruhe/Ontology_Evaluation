 abstract = {Glass-ionomer-cement (GIC) is helpful in Minimal Intervention Dentistry because it releases fluoride ions and is highly biocompatible. The aim of this study is to investigate the mechanisms by which hydroxyapatite (HAp) improves the mechanical strength and bioactive functioning of GIC when these materials are combined to make apatite ionomer cement (AIC). A conventional GIC powder was mixed with porous, spherical-HAp particles (HApS), crystalline HAp (HAp200) or one of two types of cellulose. The micro-compressive strengths of the additive particles were measured, and various specimens were evaluated with regard to their compressive strengths (CS), fluoride release concentrations (fluoride electrode) and multi-element release concentrations. The AIC was found to release higher concentrations of fluoride (1.2 times) and strontium ions (1.5 times) compared to the control GIC. It was detected the more release of calcium originated from HApS than HAp200 in AIC. The CS of the AIC incorporating an optimum level of HAp was also significantly higher than that of the GIC. These results suggest that adding HAp can increase the release concentration of ions required for remineralization while maintaining the CS of the GIC. This effect does not result from a physical phenomenon, but rather from chemical reactions between the HAp and polyacrylic acid of GIC.},

 abstract = {Non-isothermal conditions during flight cycles have long led to the requirement for thermo-mechanical fatigue (TMF) evaluation of aerospace materials. However, the increased temperatures within the gas turbine engine have meant that the requirements for TMF testing now extend to disc alloys along with blade materials. As such, fatigue crack growth rates are required to be evaluated under non-isothermal conditions along with the development of a detailed understanding of related failure mechanisms. In the current work, a TMF crack growth testing method has been developed utilising induction heating and direct current potential drop techniques for polycrystalline nickel-based superalloys, such as RR1000. Results have shown that in-phase (IP) testing produces accelerated crack growth rates compared with out-of-phase (OOP) due to increased temperature at peak stress and therefore increased time dependent crack growth. The ordering of the crack growth rates is supported by detailed fractographic analysis which shows intergranular crack growth in IP test specimens, and transgranular crack growth in 90° OOP and 180° OOP tests. Isothermal tests have also been carried out for comparison of crack growth rates at the point of peak stress in the TMF cycles.},

 abstract = {Metal additive manufacturing has strongly gained scientific and industrial importance during the last decades due to the geometrical flexibility and increased reliability of parts, as well as reduced equipment costs. Within the field of metal additive manufacturing methods, selective laser melting (SLM) is an eligible technique for the production of fully dense bulk material with complex geometry. In the current study, we addressed the application of SLM for processing a high-manganese TRansformation-/TWinning-Induced Plasticity (TRIP/TWIP) steel. The solidification behavior was analyzed by careful characterization of the as-built microstructure and element distribution using optical and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). In addition, the deformation behavior was studied using uniaxial tensile testing and SEM. Comparison with conventionally produced TRIP/TWIP steel revealed that elemental segregation, which is normally very pronounced in high-manganese steels and requires energy-intensive post processing, is reduced due to the high cooling rates during SLM. Also, the very fast cooling promoted ε- and α’-martensite formation prior to deformation. The superior strength and pronounced anisotropy of the SLM-produced material was correlated with the microstructure based on the process-specific characteristics.},

 abstract = {Despite several excellent properties including low shrinkage, good chemical resistance, curable at low temperatures and the absence of byproducts or volatiles, epoxy resins are susceptible to ultra violet (UV) damage and their durability is reduced substantially when exposed to outdoor environments. To overcome this drawback, UV absorbers have been usually used to decrease the rate of UV degradation. In this present study, the effects of UV light on the chemical, mechanical and physical properties of cured epoxy structure, as well as the effect of an organic UV absorber, Tinuvin 1130, on the epoxy properties were investigated. Chemical changes in a cured epoxy system as a result of the presence and absence of Tinuvin 1130 were determined using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) analyses. The effect of Tinuvin 1130 on the surface morphology of the epoxy systems was also investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging. Additionally, the glass transition temperatures (Tg) before and during UV radiation were measured. After an 800 h UV radiation, mechanical test results revealed that the lack of the UV absorber can lead to a ~30% reduction in tensile strength. However, in the presence of Tinuvin 1130, the tensile strength was reduced only by ~11%. It was hypothesized that the use of Tinuvin 1130, as an organic UV absorber in the epoxy-amine system, could decrease the undesirable effects, arising from exposure to UV light.},

 abstract = {Biopolymers from forestry biomass are promising for the sustainable development of new biobased materials. As such, lignin and fiber-based biocomposites are plausible renewable alternatives to petrochemical-based products. In this study, we have obtained lignin from Spruce biomass through a soda pulping process. The lignin was used for manufacturing biocomposite filaments containing 20% and 40% lignin and using polylactic acid (PLA) as matrix material. Dogbones for mechanical testing were 3D printed by fused deposition modelling. The lignin and the corresponding biocomposites were characterized in detail, including thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), antioxidant capacity, mechanical properties, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Although lignin led to a reduction of the tensile strength and modulus, the reduction could be counteracted to some extent by adjusting the 3D printing temperature. The results showed that lignin acted as a nucleating agent and thus led to further crystallization of PLA. The radical scavenging activity of the biocomposites increased to roughly 50% antioxidant potential/cm2, for the biocomposite containing 40 wt % lignin. The results demonstrate the potential of lignin as a component in biocomposite materials, which we show are adequate for 3D printing operations.},

 abstract = {Different concrete structures (viaducts, bridges, or tunnels) in the neighborhoods of railways may be subject to the stray current leaking from the rails. In these cases, the reinforcing rebars embedded in concrete act as conductors, “pick up” the stray current, and can corrode. For simulating the stray current-induced corrosion of metals, most researchers just supplied anodic polarization on samples. However, stray current induces both cathodic polarization and anodic polarization. This work experimentally justifies the different effects of stray current and anodic polarization on reinforcing steel embedded in mortar. A comparison between stray current and anodic polarization effects on the corrosion behavior of embedded steel is performed for both fresh (24 hour-cured) and hardened matrix (28 day-cured) in chloride-free (Cl-free) and chloride-containing (Cl-containing) environments. It is found that in all studied conditions, anodic polarization leads to a significantly different electrochemical performance of the steel rebar compared to the stray current. Hence, anodic polarization cannot reflect all the effects of stray current, and therefore, it has limited significance for simulating stray current. It is also clarified that the curing regimes and starting time of the stray current play significant roles in the formation of a corrosion product layer on the steel surface.},

High calcium fly ash, ladle furnace slag, and limestone filler were investigated as supplementary cementitious materials in cement pastes, and binary mixtures were produced at 10%, 20%, and 30% cement replacement rates for each material. The water requirement for maximum packing and for normal consistency were obtained for each paste, and strength development was determined at 3, 7, 28, and 90 days for the 20% replacement rate. Furthermore, two ternary mixtures at 30% cement replacement were also prepared for maximum packing density and tested for compressive strength development. The results showed that high calcium fly ash decreased cement paste packing and increased water demand but contributed to strength development through reactivity. Ladle furnace slag and limestone filler, on the other hand, were less reactive and seemed to contribute to strength development through the filler effect. The ternary paste with 70% cement, 20% high calcium fly ash, and 10% limestone filler showed equivalent strength development to that of the reference cement paste.},

 abstract = {The objective of this paper is to investigate the effect of calcium nitrite (CN) on improving the mechanical properties and microstructures of early-frozen cement paste. Cement pastes containing 1%, 1.5%, 2%, 2.5%, and 3% CN were prepared. One batch of samples was frozen at −6 °C for 7 days and then cured at 20 °C, and the other batch of samples was directly cured at 20 °C as a control. The compressive strength, ultrasonic pulse velocity, and resistivity of all specimens at different target ages were measured under these two curing conditions. The hydration products and microstructures of typical samples were observed using XRD and scanning SEM. The results showed that the addition of 1.5% CN could promote cement hydration and enhance slurry densification, thereby increasing the compressive strength, ultrasonic pulse velocity, and electrical resistivity of the slurry, and positively affecting the early freezing resistance of the slurry. However, when the CN dosage exceeded 1.5%, the internal structure of the slurry was loose and porous due to the generation of a large amount of nitrite–AFm, which negatively affects the properties of the cement paste. In addition, the effectiveness of CN is only limited to temperature environments above −6 °C. Concrete antifreeze suitable for lower temperatures still requires further research.},

 abstract = {Precast ultra-high-performance concrete (UHPC) has emerged as indispensable in the engineering sector due to its cost-effectiveness and superior performance. Currently, precast UHPC grapples with challenges pertaining to slow setting times and insufficient early strength, largely attributed to its high water-reducing agent content. Effective utilization of early strength agents to augment UHPC’s early strength is pivotal in addressing this issue. This study investigates the efficacy of two distinct concrete early strength agents, namely calcium formate (Ca(HCO2)2) and aluminum sulfate (Al2(SO4)3). A UHPC system with a water/cement ratio of 0.17 was used; both single and compound doping experiments were conducted using varied dosages of the aforementioned early strength agents. Our results show that both early strength agents significantly reduce setting time and enhance early strength at appropriate dosages. Specifically, the addition of 0.3% Ca(HCO2)2 led to a 33.07% decrease in setting time for UHPC. Moreover, the incorporation of 0.3% Ca(HCO2)2 and 0.5% Al2(SO4)3 resulted in a strength of 81.9 MPa at 1.5 days, representing a remarkable increase of 118.4%. It is noteworthy that excessive use of Ca(HCO2)2 inhibits the hydration process, whereas an abundance of Al2(SO4)3 diminishes the early strength effect. Simultaneously, this article provides recommendations regarding the dosage of two distinct early strength agents, offering a novel solution for expediting the production of prefabricated UHPC with a low water/cement ratio and high water-reducing agent content.},

Here, we prepared a high strength, high electrical conductivity and high thermal conductivity reduced graphene oxide (RGO)/Cu composite by directly heating the GO/copper formate. The oxygen-containing functional groups and defects of RGO are significantly reduced compared with those of GO. The tensile yield strength and thermal conductivity of RGO/Cu composite with RGO volume fraction of 0.49 vol.% are as high as 553 MPa and 364 W/(m·K) at room temperature, respectively. The theoretical value of the tensile yield strength of the composite is calculated according to the strengthening mechanism, and the result shows that it agrees with the experimental value. After hot-rolling treatment, the ductility and conductivity of the composite materials have been greatly improved, and the ductility of the RGO/Cu composite with RGO volume fraction of 0.49 vol.% has been increased to four times the original.

The reduction of graphene oxide was carried out by the stepwise heating of this aerogel to 250 °C. The aerogel obtained in the process of the stepwise thermal treatment of rGO/wax was studied by IR and Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and thermogravimetry. The heat treatment led to an increase in the wax fraction accompanied by an increase in the contact angle of the rGO/wax aerogel surface from 136.2 °C to 142.4 °C. The SEM analysis has shown that the spatial structure of the aerogel was formed by sheets of graphene oxide, while the wax formed rather large (200–1000 nm) clumps in the folds of graphene oxide sheets and small (several nm) deposits on the flat surface of the sheets. The sorption properties of the rGO/wax aerogel were studied with respect to eight solvent, oil, and petroleum products, and it was found that dichlorobenzene (85.8 g/g) and hexane (41.9 g/g) had the maximum and minimum sorption capacities, respectively. In the case of oil and petroleum products, the indicators were in the range of 52–63 g/g. The rGO/wax aerogel was found to be highly resistant to sorption–desorption cycles.

 abstract = {Glass fibers (GF) are the reinforcement agent most used in polypropylene (PP) based composites, as they have good balance between properties and costs. However, their final properties are mainly determined by the strength and stability of the polymer-fiber interphase. Fibers do not act as an effective reinforcing material when the adhesion is weak. Also, the adhesion between phases can be easily degraded in aggressive environmental conditions such as high temperatures and/or elevated moisture, and by the stress fields to which the material may be exposed. Many efforts have been done to improve polymer-glass fiber adhesion by compatibility enhancement. The most used techniques include modifications in glass surface, polymer matrix and/or both. However, the results obtained do not show a good costs/properties improvement relationship. The aim of this work is to perform an accurate analysis regarding methods for GF/PP adhesion improvement and to propose a new route based on PP in-situ polymerization onto fibers. This route involves the modification of fibers with an aluminum alkyl and hydroxy-α-olefin and from there to enable the growth of the PP chains using direct metallocenic copolymerization. The adhesion improvements were further proved by fragmentation test, as well as by mechanical properties measurements. The strength and toughness increases three times and the interfacial strength duplicates in PP/GF composites prepared with in-situ polymerized fibers.},

Equilibrium data were successfully fitted to the Langmuir, Freundlich and Langmuir-Freundlich model (L-F). The maximum adsorption capacity of the coffee residues can reach 70 mg/g for the removal of Cu(II) and 45 mg/g for Cr(VI). The kinetic data were fitted to pseudo-first, -second and -third order equations. The equilibrium was achieved in 120 min. Also, the effect of pH on adsorption and desorption was studied, as well as the influence of agitation rate. Ten cycles of adsorption-desorption were carried out revealing the strong reuse potential of these low-cost adsorbents; the latter was confirmed from a brief economic approach.},

@article{ma8125496,
 abstract = {This study proposes melt-blending polypropylene (PP) and high density polyethylene (HDPE) that have a similar melt flow index (MFI) to form PP/HDPE polyblends. The influence of the content of HDPE on the properties and compatibility of polyblends is examined by using a tensile test, flexural test, Izod impact test, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), polarized light microscopy (PLM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The SEM results show that PP and HDPE are incompatible polymers with PP being a continuous phase and HDPE being a dispersed phase. The FTIR results show that the combination of HDPE does not influence the chemical structure of PP, indicating that the polyblends are made of a physical blending. The DSC and XRD results show that PP and HDPE are not compatible, and the combination of HDPE is not correlated with the crystalline structure and stability of PP. The PLM results show that the combination of HDPE causes stacking and incompatibility between HDPE and PP spherulites, and PP thus has incomplete spherulite morphology and a smaller spherulite size. However, according to mechanical property test results, the combination of HDPE improves the impact strength of PP.},

 abstract = {A rapid approach has been developed for the fluorescent carbon dots (CDs) by the hydrothermal treatment of lignin in the presence of H2O2. The as-synthesized CDs were found to emit blue photoluminescence with excellent photostability. Moreover, the CDs displayed biocompatibility, low cytotoxicity, and high water solubility properties. Finally, the as-resulted CDs were demonstrated to be excellent probes for bioimaging and biosensing applications.},
