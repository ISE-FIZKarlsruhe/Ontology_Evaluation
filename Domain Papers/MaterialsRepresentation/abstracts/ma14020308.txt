Hydrogel substrate-based micropatterns can be adjusted using the pattern shape and size, affecting cell behaviors such as proliferation and differentiation under various cellular environment parameters. An electrically conductive hydrogel pattern system mimics the native muscle tissue environment. In this study, we incorporated polyaniline (PANi) in a poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) hydrogel matrix through UV-induced photolithography with photomasks, and electrically conductive hydrogel micropatterns were generated within a few seconds. The electrical conductance of the PANi/PEG hydrogel was 30.5 Â± 0.5 mS/cm. C2C12 myoblasts were cultured on the resulting substrate, and the cells adhered selectively to the PANi/PEG hydrogel regions. Myogenic differentiation of the C2C12 cells was induced, and the alignment of myotubes was consistent with the arrangement of the line pattern. The expression of myosin heavy chain on the line pattern showed potential as a substrate for myogenic cell functionalization.
