Environmental considerations and technical benefits have directed research towards reducing cement clinker content in concrete, and one of the best ways to do this is to replace cement with supplementary cementitious materials. High calcium fly ash, ladle furnace slag, and limestone filler were investigated as supplementary cementitious materials in cement pastes, and binary mixtures were produced at 10%, 20%, and 30% cement replacement rates for each material. The water requirement for maximum packing and for normal consistency were obtained for each paste, and strength development was determined at 3, 7, 28, and 90 days for the 20% replacement rate. Furthermore, two ternary mixtures at 30% cement replacement were also prepared for maximum packing density and tested for compressive strength development. The results showed that high calcium fly ash decreased cement paste packing and increased water demand but contributed to strength development through reactivity. Ladle furnace slag and limestone filler, on the other hand, were less reactive and seemed to contribute to strength development through the filler effect. The ternary paste with 70% cement, 20% high calcium fly ash, and 10% limestone filler showed equivalent strength development to that of the reference cement paste.
