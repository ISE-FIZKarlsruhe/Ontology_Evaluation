ABSTRACT = {The use of CNC equipment that integrates several machining operations eliminates downtime due to changes in setup and clamping of workpieces in more than one machining device. A review of CNC equipment and tools known from the literature and from manufacturers’ offerings indicates that new technical solutions are being developed to integrate two or more technological operations. However, these examples have numerous limitations and are mostly not suitable for machining surfaces with complex shapes. An example of such solutions is the use of a dual-tool grinding head, which integrates the process of rough grinding with a ceramic grinding wheel and finish grinding with a flexible grinding wheel. Unfortunately, it has the disadvantage of being limited by the angular shape of the ceramic grinding wheel, making it unable to adapt to the complex geometries of the shaped surfaces being ground. The need to overcome this limitation became the motivation for the research work described in this article. By means of experimental research, it was verified what effect the radial outline on the periphery of a ceramic grinding wheel realized by rough grinding would have on the surface roughness parameters obtained in the process of grinding shaped surfaces. For this purpose, grinding processes using a ceramic wheel with a conical and radial outline were compared. The result of the study was a summary of the surface roughness parameters Sa, St, Sq, Spk, Str, and Sds obtained after two-stage machining (rough and finish grinding). The obtained analysis results showed that changing the axial outline of the ceramic grinding wheel makes it possible to significantly expand the range of applications of the dual-tool head without negatively affecting the quality of the machined surface. Thus, such an improvement will make it possible to increase the applicability of the head by grinding shaped surfaces with a radial profile of curvature.},

ABSTRACT = {The frontiers of antibacterial materials in the biomedical field are constantly evolving since infectious diseases are a continuous threat to human health. In this work, waste-wool-derived keratin electrospun nanofibers were blended with copper by an optimized impregnation procedure to fabricate antibacterial membranes with intrinsic biological activity, excellent degradability and good cytocompatibility. The keratin/copper complex electrospun nanofibers were multi-analytically characterized and the main differences in their physical–chemical features were related to the crosslinking effect caused by Cu2+. Indeed, copper ions modified the thermal profiles, improving the thermal stability (evaluated by differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetry), and changed the infrared vibrational features (determined by infrared spectroscopy) and the chemical composition (studied by an X-ray energy-dispersive spectroscopy probe and optical emission spectrometry). The copper impregnation process also affected the morphology, leading to partial nanofiber swelling, as evidenced by scanning electron microscopy analyses. Then, the membranes were successfully tested as antibacterial materials against gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli. Regarding cytocompatibility, in vitro assays performed with L929 cells showed good levels of cell adhesion and proliferation (XTT assay), and no significant cytotoxic effect, in comparison to bare keratin nanofibers. Given these results, the material described in this work can be suitable for use as antibiotic-free fibers for skin wound dressing or membranes for guided tissue regeneration.},

ABSTRACT = {In this research, we developed boron-rich nanoparticles that can be used for boron neutron capture therapy as potential carriers for boron delivery to cancerous tissues. Functionalized carbonated boron nitride nanostructures (CBNs) were successfully synthesized in self-propagating combustion waves in mixtures of high-nitrogen explosives and boron compounds. The products’ composition, morphology, and structural features were investigated using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, powder X-ray diffraction, low-temperature nitrogen sorption analysis, thermogravimetric analysis, high-resolution scanning electron microscopy, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. The extreme conditions prevailing in combustion waves favor the formation of nanosized CBN hollow grains with highly disordered structures that are properly functionalized on the surface and inside the particles. Therefore, they are characterized by high porosity and good dispersibility in water, which are necessary for medical applications. During biological tests, a concentration-dependent effect of the obtained boron nitride preparations on the viability of normal and neoplastic cells was demonstrated. Moreover, the assessment of the degree of binding of fluorescently labeled nanoparticles to selected cells confirmed the relationships between the cell types and the concentration of the preparation at different incubation time points.},

ABSTRACT = {In the realm of modern architecture, the demand for materials that combine strength, durability, and aesthetic flexibility is ever-growing. Addressing this need, this paper presents a study on the innovative use of aluminum extrudates in construction. Focusing on the AA6005 alloy, which is known for its excellent balance of strength, corrosion resistance, and weldability, this research delves into the development of an extrusion process that yields thin-walled, lightweight, yet high-strength structural components. Using FEM simulations, a new extrudate of the AA6005A was developed. It is compatible with standard façade systems, with high-strength properties and a weight reduced by 20% compared to that of conventional extrudates made of the AA6063 alloy. Using CAD engineering and FEM simulations of aluminum extrusion process, an innovative die was designed for the extrusion process, ensuring uniform flow of metal from the bearing and minimizing the elastic deflection of the die. This resulted in an increase in the extrusion velocity of thin-walled extrudate from AA6005A by 24% compared to conventional profiles extruded from AA6063. As part of the research, a trial test was carried out in production conditions and the quality of the extrudates was tested by 3D optical scanning, mechanical and structural properties tests, and microstructure observation.},

ABSTRACT = {Reversible optical regulation has potential applications in optical anti-counterfeiting, storage, and catalysis. Compared to common power materials, the reverse opal structure has a larger specific surface area and an increased contact area for optical regulation, which is expected to achieve higher regulation rates. However, it is difficult to achieve reversible and repeatable regulation of the luminescent properties of photonic crystals, especially with the current research on the structural collapse of photonic crystals. In this work, WO3: Yb3+, Er3+ inverse photonic crystals were prepared by the template approach, and reversible multi-mode optical modification was investigated. Upon heat treatment in a reducing atmosphere or air, the color of the photonic crystals can reversibly change from light yellow to dark green, accompanied by changes in absorption and upconversion of luminescence intensity. The stability and fatigue resistance of this reversible optical modification ability were explored through cyclic experiments, providing potential practical applications for photocatalysis, optical information storage, and electrochromism.},

ABSTRACT = {The significant impact of Nb on ferrite transformation, both in terms of solute drag effect (SDE) and interphase precipitation, was investigated quantitatively. Ferrite transformation kinetics were characterized using thermal expansion experiments and theoretical calculations. The microstructures were characterized using high−temperature confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), a field−emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM), and a transmission electron microscope (TEM). Under a higher driving force, interphase precipitations were observed in the sample with a higher Nb content. A three−dimensional (3D) reconstruction method was used to convert the two−dimensional (2D) image of interphase precipitation into a three−dimensional model for a more typical view. The SDE and interphase precipitation had opposite effects on the kinetics of ferrite transformation. A lower Nb content showed a strong contribution to the SDE, which delayed ferrite transformation. A higher concentration of Nb was expected to enhance the SDE, but the inhibition effect was eliminated by the interphase precipitation of NbC during interfacial migration. Both the experimental results and theoretical calculations confirmed this phenomenon.},

ABSTRACT = {Carbon fibre-reinforced plastic (CFRP) composites, prized for their exceptional properties, often encounter surface quality issues during slotting due to their inherent heterogeneity. This paper tackles CFRP slotting challenges by employing multi-tooth mills in experiments with various fibre orientations and tool feed rates. In-plane scratching tests are performed under linearly varying loads; then, slotting experiments are conducted at different parameters. The scratching test results indicate that the fibre orientation and cutting angles have significant influences on forces and fracture process. The slotting experiments demonstrate that cutting forces and surface roughness Sa of the bottom slotting surface are notably affected by the fibre orientation, with disparities between up-milling and down-milling sides. Reorganising Sa data by local fibre cutting angle θ highlights consistent Sa variations between up-milling and down-milling sides for 0° ≤ θ ≤ 90°, with lower Sa on the up-milling side. However, for 90° < θ ≤ 150°, Sa variations diverge, with lower Sa on the down-milling side. Unexpectedly, Sa on the down-milling side decreases with increasing θ in this range. Additionally, the tool feed rate exerts a more pronounced influence on Sa on the up-milling side.},

ABSTRACT = {In the finite element analysis of asphalt concrete (AC), it is nowadays common to incorporate the information from the underlying scales to study the overall response of this material. Heterogeneity observed at the asphalt mixture scale is analyzed in this paper. Reliable finite element analysis (FEA) of asphalt concrete comprises a set of complex issues. The two main aspects of the asphalt concrete FEA discussed in this study are: (1) digital reconstruction of the asphalt pavement microstructure using processing of the high-quality images; and (2) FEA of the asphalt concrete idealized samples accounting for the viscoelastic material model. Reconstruction of the asphalt concrete microstructure is performed using a sequence of image processing operations (binarization, removing holes, filtering, segmentation and boundaries detection). Geometry of the inclusions (aggregate) are additionally simplified in a controlled mode to reduce the numerical cost of the analysis. As is demonstrated in the study, the introduced geometry simplifications are justified. Computational cost reduction exceeds of several orders of magnitude additional modeling error occurring due to the applied simplification technique. Viscoelastic finite element analysis of the AC identified microstructure is performed using the Burgers material model. The analysis algorithm is briefly described with a particular focus on the computational efficiency aspects. In order to illustrate the proposed approach, a set of 2D problems is solved. Numerical results confirm both the effectiveness of the self-developed code and the applicability of the Burgers model to the analyzed class of AC analysis problems. Further research directions are also described to highlight the potential benefits of the developed approach to numerical modeling of asphalt concrete.},

ABSTRACT = {This work is focused on a novel, promising low temperature phase change material (PCM), based on the eutectic Glauber’s salt composition. To allow phase transition within the refrigeration range of temperatures of +5 °C to +12 °C, combined with a high repeatability of melting–freezing processes, and minimized subcooling, the application of three variants of sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (Na-CMC) with distinct molecular weights (700,000, 250,000, and 90,000) is considered. The primary objective is to optimize the stabilization of this eutectic PCM formulation, while maintaining the desired enthalpy level. Preparation methods are refined to ensure repeatability in mixing components, thereby optimizing performance and stability. Additionally, the influence of Na-CMC molecular weight on stabilization is examined through differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), T-history, and rheology tests. The PCM formulation of interest builds upon prior research in which borax, ammonium chloride, and potassium chloride were used as additives to sodium sulfate decahydrate (Glauber’s salt), prioritizing environmentally responsible materials. The results reveal that CMC with molecular weights of 250 kg/mol and 90 kg/mol effectively stabilize the PCM without phase separation issues, slowing crystallization kinetics. Conversely, CMC of 700 kg/mol proved ineffective due to the disruption of gel formation at its low gel point, hindering higher concentrations. Calculations of ionic concentration indicate higher Na ion content in PCM stabilized with 90 kg/mol CMC, suggesting increased ionic interactions and gel strength. A tradeoff is discovered between the faster crystallization in lower molecular weight CMC and the higher concentration required, which increases the amount of inert material that does not participate in the phase transition. After thermal cycling, the best formulation had a latent heat of 130 J/g with no supercooling, demonstrating excellent performance. This work advances PCM’s reliability as a thermal energy storage solution for diverse applications and highlights the complex relationship between Na-CMC molecular weight and PCM stabilization.},

ABSTRACT = {In recent years, tubular nanostructures have been related to immense advances in various fields of science and technology. Considerable research efforts have been centred on the theoretical prediction and manufacturing of non-carbon nanotubes (NTs), which meet modern requirements for the development of novel devices and systems. In this context, diatomic inorganic nanotubes formed by atoms of elements from the 13th group of the periodic table (B, Al, Ga, In, Tl) and nitrogen (N) have received much research attention. In this study, the elastic properties of single-walled boron nitride, aluminium nitride, gallium nitride, indium nitride, and thallium nitride nanotubes were assessed numerically using the nanoscale continuum modelling approach (also called molecular structural mechanics). The elastic properties (rigidities, surface Young’s and shear moduli, and Poisson’s ratio) of nitride nanotubes are discussed with respect to the bond length of the corresponding diatomic hexagonal lattice. The results obtained contribute to a better understanding of the mechanical response of nitride compound-based nanotubes, covering a broad range, from the well-studied boron nitride NTs to the hypothetical thallium nitride NTs.},

The structure of Y3Al5-2x(Mg,Ge)xO12 (x = 1, 2) was determined to be a cubic unit cell (Ia-3d), which contains an 8-coordinated Y3+ site with octahedral (Mg,Al)O6 and tetrahedral (Al,Ge)O4 polyhedra, using synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction. When Eu3+ or Ce3+ ions were substituted for the Y3+ site in the Y3Al5-2x(Mg,Ge)xO12 host lattices, the emission spectra showed a decrease in the magnetic dipole f-f Eu3+ transition and a redshift of the d-f Ce3+ transition, related to centrosymmetry and crystal field splitting, respectively. These changes were monitored according to the increase in Mg2+ and Ge4+ contents. The dodecahedral and octahedral edge sharing was identified as a key distortion factor for the structure-correlated luminescence in the Eu3+/Ce3+-doped Y3Al5-2x(Mg,Ge)xO12 garnet phosphors.},

ABSTRACT = {The heat treatment of aluminum alloys is very important in industries where low weight in combination with high wear resistance, good strength, and hardness are important. However, depending on their chemical composition, aluminum alloys are subjected to different mechanical and thermal treatments to achieve the most favorable properties. In this study, an Al-Zn-Mg alloy was heat-treated including solution annealing at 490 °C for 1 h with subsequent artificial aging at 130, 160, and 190 °C for 1, 5, and 9 h. The hardness (HV1) and abrasive wear resistance with three different abrasive grain sizes were measured for all samples. The highest hardness was measured for the samples artificially aged at 130 °C/5 h, 227 HV1, while the lowest hardness was measured for the samples aged at 190 °C/9 h. The highest and the lowest wear resistance was also observed for the same state, i.e., artificially aged at 130 °C/5 h and 190 °C/9 h, respectively. The critical abrasive grain size was detected for some samples, where a decrease in wear rate was observed with an increase in the abrasive grain size from the medium value to the largest. The Response Surface Methodology (RSM) was applied to demonstrate the influence of the input parameters on the material wear rate.},

ABSTRACT = {Advances in electronics and medical diagnostics have made organic dyes extremely popular as key functional materials. From a practical viewpoint, it is necessary to assess the spectroscopic and physicochemical properties of newly designed dyes. In this context, the condensation of 1,3-dimethylbarbituric acid with electron-rich alkylaminobenzaldehyde derivatives has been described, resulting in a series of merocyanine-type dyes. These dyes exhibit intense blue-light absorption but weak fluorescence. An electron-donating alkylamino group at position C4 is responsible for the solvatochromic behavior of the dyes since the lone electron pair of the nitrogen atom is variably delocalized toward the barbituric ring, which exhibits electron-withdrawing properties. This was elucidated, taking into account the different geometry of the amino group. The intramolecular charge transfer in the molecules is responsible for the relatively high redshift in absorption and fluorescence spectra. Additionally, an increase in solvent polarity moves the absorption and fluorescence to lower energy regions. The observed solvatochromism is discussed in terms of the four-parameter Catalán solvent polarity scale. The differences in the behavior of the dyes were quantified with the aid of time-dependent density functional theory calculations. The obtained results made it possible to find regularities linking the basic spectroscopic properties of the compounds with their chemical structure. This is important in the targeted search for new, practically important dyes.},

ABSTRACT = {Co-condensation of mixed SiGe nanoclusters and impingement of SiGe nanoclusters on a Si substrate were applied using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation in this study to mimic the fast epitaxial growth of SiGe/Si heterostructures under mesoplasma chemical vapor deposition (CVD) conditions. The condensation dynamics and properties of the SiGe nanoclusters during the simulations were investigated first, and then the impingement of transient SiGe nanoclusters on both Si smooth and trench substrate surfaces under varying conditions was studied theoretically. The results show that the mixed nanoclusters as precursors demonstrate potential for enhancing epitaxial SiGe film growth at a high growth rate, owing to their loosely bound atomic structures and high mobility on the substrate surface. By varying cluster sizes and substrate temperatures, this study also reveals that smaller clusters and higher substrate temperatures contribute to faster structural ordering and smoother surface morphologies. Furthermore, the formed layers display a consistent SiGe composition, closely aligning with nominal values, and the cluster-assisted deposition method achieves the epitaxial bridging of heterostructures during cluster impingement, highlighting its additional distinctive characteristics. The implications of this work make it clear that the mechanism of fast alloyed epitaxial film growth by cluster-assisted mesoplasma CVD is critical for extending it as a versatile platform for synthesizing various epitaxial films.},

ABSTRACT = {Chromium- and cobalt-based alloys, as well as chrome–nickel steels, are most used in dental prosthetics. Unfortunately, these alloys, especially nickel-based alloys, can cause allergic reactions. A disadvantage of these alloys is also insufficient corrosion resistance. To improve the properties of these alloys, amorphous Si (C,N) coatings were deposited on the surfaces of metal specimens. This paper characterizes coatings of silicon carbide nitrides, deposited by the magnetron sputtering method on the surface of nickel–chromium alloys used in dental prosthetics. Depending on the deposition parameters, coatings with varying carbon to nitrogen ratios were obtained. The study analyzed their structure and chemical and phase composition. In addition, a study of surface wettability and surface roughness was performed. Based on the results obtained, it was found that amorphous coatings of Si (C,N) type with thicknesses of 2 to 4.5 µm were obtained. All obtained coatings increase the value of surface free energy. The study showed that Si (C,N)-type films can be used in dental prosthetics as protective coatings.},

ABSTRACT = {Cutlery and flatware designs are an everchanging phenomenon of the manufacturing industry. Worldwide hospitality businesses demand perpetual evolution in terms of aesthetics, designs, patterns, colours, and materials due to customers’ demands, modernisation, and fierce competition. To thrive in this competitive market, modern fabrication techniques must be flexible, adoptive, fast, and cost effective. For decades, static designs and trademark patterns were achieved through moulds, limiting production to a single cutlery type per mould. However, with the advent of laser engraving and design systems, the whole business of cutlery production has been revolutionised. This study explores the possibility of creating diverse designs for stainless steel 304 flatware sets without changing the entire production process. The research analyses three key laser process parameters, power, scanning speed, and number of passes, and their impacts on the resulting geometry, depth of cut, surface roughness, and material removed. These parameters are comprehensively studied and analysed for steel and zirconia ceramic. The study details the effects of power, scanning speed, number of passages, and fluence on engraved geometry. Fluence (power*number of passages/scanning speed) positively influences outputs and presents a positive trend. Medium power settings and higher scanning speeds with the maximum number of passages produce high-quality, low-roughness optimised cavities with the ideal geometric accuracy for both materials.},

ABSTRACT = {A series of freeze–thaw cycling tests, as well as cyclic loading and unloading tests, have been conducted on nodular sandstones to investigate the effect of fatigue loading and freeze–thaw cycling on the damage evolution of fractured sandstones based on damage mechanics theory, the microstructure and sandstone pore fractal theory. The results show that the number of freeze–thaw cycles, the cyclic loading level, the pore distribution and the complex program are important factors affecting the damage evolution of rocks. As the number of freeze–thaw cycles rises, the peak strength, modulus of elasticity, modulus of deformation and damping ratio of the sandstone all declined. Additionally, the modulus of elasticity and deformation increase nonlinearly as the cyclic load level rises. With the rate of increase decreasing, while the dissipation energy due to hysteresis increases gradually and at an increasing rate, and the damping ratio as a whole shows a gradual decrease, with a tendency to increase at a later stage. The NRM (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) demonstrated that the total porosity and micro-pores of the sandstone increased linearly with the number of freeze–thaw cycles and that the micro-porosity was more sensitive to freeze–thaw, gradually shifting towards meso-pores and macro-pores; simultaneously, the SEM (Scanning Electron Microscope) indicated that the more freeze–thaw cycles there are, the more micro-fractures and holes grow and penetrate each other and the more loose the structure is, with an overall nest-like appearance. To explore the mechanical behavior and mechanism of cracked rock in high-altitude and alpine areas, a damage model under the coupling of freeze–thaw-fatigue loading was established based on the loading and unloading response ratio theory and strain equivalence principle.},

ABSTRACT = {In recent years, asphalt pavement has been subjected to varied environmental conditions during its service life, conditions that predispose it to deformation and cracking. To enhance the performance of asphalt pavement, rock asphalt has been selected as a modifier due to its good compatibility with virgin asphalt binder and its ability to improve the fatigue cracking resistance of asphalt mixtures. Although scholars have conducted some studies on rock asphalt mixtures, research on the fatigue and self-healing performance of these mixtures under conditions such as ultraviolet (UV) aging and freeze–thaw remains limited. This paper presents findings from a study that employs a combined fatigue-healing test to assess the impact of such complex environmental factors on the fatigue and self-healing properties of fine aggregate matrix (FAM) mixtures containing three types of rock asphalts, i.e., Buton, Qingchuan (QC), and Uintaite Modifier (UM). The analysis of fatigue-healing test results, grounded in viscoelastic continuum damage (VECD) theory, indicates that rock asphalt can extend the fatigue life of FAM mixtures, albeit with a concomitant decrease in their self-healing capabilities. The study further reveals that UV aging, freeze–thaw, and UV aging–freeze–thaw conditions all led to a diminution in the fatigue and self-healing properties of FAM mixtures. However, FAM mixtures containing rock asphalt demonstrated greater resilience against these reductions. Atomic force microscope (AFM) results indicate that UV aging reduced the number of bee-structures and enlarged their area, whereas the incorporation of rock asphalt enhanced the uniformity of these structures’ distribution, thereby improving the fatigue cracking resistance of FAM mixtures. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis reveals that while UV aging increased the carbonyl and sulfoxide indices within the asphalt binder, rock asphalt is effective in mitigating this effect to a certain degree, thereby enhancing the aging resistance of FAM mixtures.},

ABSTRACT = {The tack of prepreg is a key factor affecting the automatic tape laying process. During the manufacturing process of large composite parts, prepreg material may be stored at room temperature for several days, resulting in a decrease in its tack. In this study, a new tack test tool was designed, and the decay rate of prepreg tack at different temperatures was tested. We proposed a prepreg tack decay model, which assumes that the main factor in tack decay is the reduction in resin chain activity during storage. The maximum deviation between the model calculation results and the experimental results of the tack decay rate is 9.7%. This study also proposed a new statistical unit for prepreg tack, which can establish the relationship between the tack of prepreg and its remaining storage time and reduce prepreg management costs.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper brings a new insight into understanding the influence of macrocapsules in packing systems, which can be useful in designing the inert structure of self-healing concrete. A variety of tubular macrocapsules, in terms of types and sizes, was used to assess the capsules’ effect in the packing, together with various aggregate types and fractions. The voids ratios (U) of aggregate mixtures were evaluated experimentally and compared with the prediction via the particle packing model of Dewar. The packing of coarse particles was found to be considerably affected by the presence of macrocapsules, while no capsules’ effect on the packing of fine particles was attained. A higher capsule dosage and capsule aspect ratio led to a higher voids ratio. In the formulation of the inert structure, the packing disturbance due to capsules can be minimised by increasing the content of fine aggregates over coarse aggregates. Dewar’s model showed a good compatibility with experimental results in the absence of capsules. However, the model needed to be upgraded for the introduction of tubular macrocapsules. Accordingly, the effect of macrocapsules was extensively analysed and a ‘U model’ for capsules (with some limitations) was finally proposed, offering a high predicting accuracy.},

ABSTRACT = {The present paper introduces an innovative strain energy function (SEF) for incompressible anisotropic fiber-reinforced materials. This SEF is specifically designed to understand the mechanical behavior of carbon fiber-woven fabric. The considered model combines polyconvex invariants forming an integrity basisin polynomial form, which is inspired by the application of Noether’s theorem. A single solution can be obtained during the identification because of the relationship between the SEF we have constructed and the material parameters, which are linearly dependent. The six material parameters were precisely determined through a comparison between the closed-form solutions from our model and the corresponding tensile experimental data with different stretching ratios, with determination coefficients consistently reaching a remarkable value of 0.99. When considering only uniaxial tensile tests, our model can be simplified from a quadratic polynomial to a linear polynomial, thereby reducing the number of material parameters required from six to four, while the fidelity of the model’s predictive accuracy remains unaltered. The comparison between the results of numerical calculations and experiments proves the efficiency and accuracy of the method.},

ABSTRACT = {SiBCN ceramics based on SiC, BN and Si3N4 structures have good comprehensive properties such as high-temperature resistance, oxidation resistance, creep resistance and long life, which makes it one of the very promising ceramic material systems in military and aerospace fields, etc. In this study, SiBCN ceramics, as well as Si3N4f/BN/SiBCN microcomposites, were prepared by a polymer infiltration pyrolysis method using PBSZ as the polymer precursor. The PBSZ was completely ceramized by pyrolysis at 900 °C. The weight loss and elemental bonding forms of the products after the pyrolysis of the precursors hardly changed from 600 °C to 900 °C. After pyrolysis at 600 °C for 4 h and using the BN coating obtained from twice deposition as the interfacial phase, a more desirable weak interface of fiber/matrix with a binding strength of 21.96 ± 2.01 MPa can be obtained. Si3N4f/BN/SiBCN ceramic matrix microcomposites prepared under the same pyrolysis conditions have a relatively good tensile strength of 111.10 MPa while retaining a weak interface between the fibers and the matrix. The results of the study provide more theoretical and methodological support for the application of new composite structural ceramic material systems.},

ABSTRACT = {This study introduces an advanced computational method aimed at accelerating continuum-scale processes using crystal plasticity approaches to predict mechanical responses in cobalt-based superalloys. The framework integrates two levels, namely, sub-grain and homogenized, at the meso-scale through crystal plasticity finite element (CPFE) platforms. The model is applicable across a temperature range from room temperature up to 900 °C, accommodating various dislocation mechanisms in the microstructure. The sub-grain level explicitly incorporates precipitates and employs a dislocation density-based constitutive model that is size-dependent. In contrast, the homogenized level utilizes an activation energy-based constitutive model, implicitly representing the γ′ phase for efficiency in computations. This level considers the effects of composition and morphology on mechanical properties, demonstrating the potential for cobalt-based superalloys to rival nickel-based superalloys. The study aims to investigate the impacts of elements including tungsten, tantalum, titanium, and chromium through the homogenized constitutive model. The model accounts for the locking mechanism to address the cross-slip of screw dislocations at lower temperatures as well as the glide and climb mechanism to simulate diffusions at higher temperatures. The model’s validity is established across diverse compositions and morphologies, as well as various temperatures, through comparison with experimental data. This advanced computational framework not only enables accurate predictions of mechanical responses in cobalt-based superalloys across a wide temperature range, but also provides valuable insights into the design and optimization of these materials for high-temperature applications.},

ABSTRACT = {The significance of rheology in the context of bio three-dimensional (3D) printing lies in its impact on the printing behavior, which shapes material flow and the layer-by-layer stacking process. The objective of this study is to evaluate the rheological and printing behaviors of polycaprolactone (PCL) and dimethyl sulfone (DMSO2) composites. The rheological properties were examined using a rotational rheometer, employing a frequency sweep test. Simultaneously, the printing behavior was investigated using a material extrusion 3D printer, encompassing varying printing temperatures and pressures. Across the temperature range of 120–140 °C, both PCL and PCL/DMSO2 composites demonstrated liquid-like behavior, with a higher loss modulus than storage modulus. This behavior exhibited shear-thinning characteristics. The addition of DMSO2 10, 20, and 30 wt% into the PCL matrix reduced a zero-shear viscosity of 33, 46, and 74% compared to PCL, respectively. The materials exhibited extrusion velocities spanning from 0.0850 to 6.58 mm/s, with velocity being governed by the reciprocal of viscosity. A significant alteration in viscosity by temperature change directly led to a pronounced fluctuation in extrusion velocity. Extrusion velocities below 0.21 mm/s led to the production of unstable printed lines. The presence of distinct viscosities altered extrusion velocity, flow rate, and strut diameter. This phenomenon allowed the categorization of pore shape into three zones: irregular, normal, and no-pore zones. It underscored the importance of comprehending the rheological aspects of biomaterials in enhancing the overall quality of bio-scaffolds during the 3D printing process.},

ABSTRACT = {The distribution of reinforcements and interfacial bonding state with the metal matrix are crucial factors in achieving excellent comprehensive mechanical properties for aluminum (Al) matrix composites. Normally, after heat treatment, graphene nanosheets (GNSs)/Al composites experience a significant loss of strength. Here, better performance of GNS/Al was explored with a hybrid strategy by introducing 0.9 vol.% silicon carbide nanoparticles (SiCnp) into the composite. Pre-ball milling of Al powders and 0.9 vol.% SiCnp gained Al flakes that provided a large dispersion area for 3.0 vol.% GNS during the shift speed ball milling process, leading to uniformly dispersed GNS for both as-sintered and as-extruded (0.9 vol.% SiCnp + 3.0 vol.% GNS)/Al. High-temperature heat treatment at 600 °C for 60 min was performed on the as-extruded composite, giving rise to intragranular distribution of SiCnp due to recrystallization and grain growth of the Al matrix. Meanwhile, nanoscale Al4C3, which can act as an additional reinforcing nanoparticle, was generated because of an appropriate interfacial reaction between GNS and Al. The intragranular distribution of both nanoparticles improves the Al matrix continuity of composites and plays a key role in ensuring the plasticity of composites. As a result, the work hardening ability of the heat-treated hybrid (0.9 vol.% SiCnp + 3.0 vol.% GNS)/Al composite was well improved, and the tensile elongation increased by 42.7% with little loss of the strength. The present work provides a new strategy in achieving coordination on strength–plasticity of Al matrix composites.},

ABSTRACT = {The present study concerns the preparation of hybrid nanostructures composed of carbon dots (CDs) synthesized in our lab and a double-hydrophilic poly(2-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate-co-oligo(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate) (P(DMAEMA-co-OEGMA)) random copolymer through electrostatic interactions between the negatively charged CDs and the positively charged DMAEMA segments of the copolymer. The synthesis of P(DMAEMA-co-OEGMA) copolymer was conducted through RAFT polymerization. Furthermore, the copolymer was converted into a strong cationic random polyelectrolyte through quaternization of the amine groups of DMAEMA segments with methyl iodide (CH3I), and it was subsequently utilized for the complexation with the carbon dots. The molecular, physicochemical, and photophysical characterization of the aqueous solution of the copolymers and their hybrid nanoparticles was conducted using dynamic and electrophoretic light scattering (DLS, ELS) and spectroscopic techniques, such as UV-Vis, fluorescence (FS), and FT-IR spectroscopy. In addition, studies of their aqueous solution using DLS and ELS showed their responsiveness to external stimuli (pH, temperature, ionic strength). Finally, the interaction of selected hybrid nanoparticles with iron (III) ions was confirmed through FS spectroscopy, demonstrating their potential application for heavy metal ions sensing.},

ABSTRACT = {The objective of this paper is to investigate the effect of calcium nitrite (CN) on improving the mechanical properties and microstructures of early-frozen cement paste. Cement pastes containing 1%, 1.5%, 2%, 2.5%, and 3% CN were prepared. One batch of samples was frozen at −6 °C for 7 days and then cured at 20 °C, and the other batch of samples was directly cured at 20 °C as a control. The compressive strength, ultrasonic pulse velocity, and resistivity of all specimens at different target ages were measured under these two curing conditions. The hydration products and microstructures of typical samples were observed using XRD and scanning SEM. The results showed that the addition of 1.5% CN could promote cement hydration and enhance slurry densification, thereby increasing the compressive strength, ultrasonic pulse velocity, and electrical resistivity of the slurry, and positively affecting the early freezing resistance of the slurry. However, when the CN dosage exceeded 1.5%, the internal structure of the slurry was loose and porous due to the generation of a large amount of nitrite–AFm, which negatively affects the properties of the cement paste. In addition, the effectiveness of CN is only limited to temperature environments above −6 °C. Concrete antifreeze suitable for lower temperatures still requires further research.},

ABSTRACT = {The poor early shrinkage and cracking performances of manufactured sand concrete, waste powder concrete, and recycled aggregate concrete are the main difficulties in engineering applications. To solve these problems, early shrinkage and cracking, strength, and impermeability tests were performed on high-volume stone powder manufactured sand concrete mixed with fly ash and slag powder (FS), a shrinkage-reducing agent (SRA), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) fibers, and a superabsorbent polymer (SAP). Furthermore, the microstructures and pore structures of these concretes were revealed using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results showed that the mixture of FS, SRA, PVA fibers, and SAP could effectively inhibit the shrinkage strain and cracking area of the concrete. The effect of the SAP on reducing the early shrinkage of the concrete is the greatest, and the shrinkage strain can be reduced by 76.49%. The PVA fibers had the most obvious effect on inhibiting the early cracking of the concrete, and the total cracking area was reduced by 66.91%. Significantly, the incorporation of the FS can improve the particle gradation and the pore structure and improve its compactness. The PVA fibers not only provide good carriers for cement-based materials but also enhance the bonding force between the particles inside the concrete, filling the pores inside the concrete, inhibiting the loss of water, and reducing the generation of internal microcracks. The FS and PVA can reduce the shrinkage and cracking risk and improve the strength and impermeability of the concrete. Although the SRA and SAP can reduce the shrinkage and cracking risks, it will lead to a significant decrease in the later strength and impermeability. The main reason is that the SRA leads to an increase in micropores in the matrix and microcracks near the aggregate, which are not conducive to the development of the strength and penetration resistance of the MS. Similarly, the SAP can promote the rapid formation of ettringite (Aft) at an early age and improve the early shrinkage, early cracking, and early strength of the concrete. However, with an increase in age, the residual pores, after SAP dehydration, will cause the deterioration of the concrete pore structure, resulting in the deterioration of the strength and impermeability.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper presents the results of the study of stress relaxation fields, deformation, and temperature of the system of nanostructured multilayer coatings. In the work, a nonlinear relationship between strain and stress was used to take into account nonlinear effects in the mechanism of nanostructure formation. The paper assumes that a friction surface is provided by the self-organization of shear components: both stress and strain on the one hand, and temperature on the other. The studied objects are described in the adiabatic approximation, taking into account the fact of the evolution of stresses and strains. With the help of phase portraits of the system, the dependence of the deformation processes on the stresses arising in the system without coating and with coating is shown. It is shown that the rate of change of deformation depends on the characteristics of the mechanical impact on the coating and on the amount of stress and deformation. A conclusion is drawn regarding the transition process in the presence of two regions (Hooke and plastic deformation) in the corresponding phase portrait of the strain–stress field of the system. The results of the work can be used to determine the effective parameters of a coating in the analysis of experimental time dependences of stresses.},

ABSTRACT = {In normal cold rolling, the elastic deformation of the strip is typically ignored because of the dominant plastic deformation. However, this neglect may introduce additional errors when the strip is very thin. The aim of this study is to investigate the characteristics of the deformation region and thickness reduction in the asymmetrical rolling of ultra-thin strips. Mathematical models were developed based on the slab method, with consideration of the elastic deformation of the strips, and employed in the simulation calculation. The percentage of the three zones and the thickness reduction were analyzed using the simulation results. An increase in the speed ratio results in an increase in the reduction ratio, which is influenced by parameters, such as front tension, back tension, friction coefficient, and entry thickness. The elastic deformation of the strip reduces the tension and the roll pressure and causes the reduction ratio to decrease. The findings and conclusions of this study may be helpful to the mill operating in the asymmetrical rolling process of ultra-thin strips.},

ABSTRACT = {The improved wear and corrosion resistance of gray cast iron (GCI) with enhanced mechanical properties is a proven stepping stone towards the longevity of its versatile industrial applications. In this article, we have tailored the microstructural properties of GCI by alloying it with titanium (Ti) and tungsten (W) additives, which resulted in improved mechanical, wear, and corrosion resistance. The results also show the nucleation of the B-, D-, and E-type graphite flakes with the A-type graphite flake in the alloyed GCI microstructure. Additionally, the alloyed microstructure demonstrated that the ratio of the pearlite volume percentage to the ferrite volume percentage was improved from 67/33 to 87/13, whereas a reduction in the maximum graphite length and average grain size from 356 ± 31 µm to 297 ± 16 µm and 378 ± 18 µm to 349 ± 19 µm was detected. Consequently, it improved the mechanical properties and wear and corrosion resistance of alloyed GCI. A significant improvement in Brinell hardness, yield strength, and tensile strength of the modified microstructure from 213 ± 7 BHN to 272 ± 8 BHN, 260 ± 3 MPa to 310 ± 2 MPa, and 346 ± 12 MPa to 375 ± 7 MPa was achieved, respectively. The substantial reduction in the wear rate of alloyed GCI from 8.49 × 10−3 mm3/N.m to 1.59 × 10−3 mm3/N.m resulted in the upgradation of the surface roughness quality from 297.625 nm to 192.553 nm. Due to the increase in the corrosion potential from −0.5832 V to −0.4813 V, the impedance of the alloyed GCI was increased from 1545 Ohm·cm2 to 2290 Ohm·cm2. On the basis of the achieved experimental results, it is suggested that the reliability of alloyed GCI based on experimentally validated microstructural compositions can be ensured during the operation of plants and components in a severe wear and corrosive environment. It can be predicted that the proposed alloyed GCI components are capable of preventing the premature failure of high-tech components susceptible to a wear and corrosion environment.},

ABSTRACT = {Ionic electroactive polymer (iEAP) actuators are recognized as exceptional candidates for artificial muscle development, with significant potential applications in bionic robotics, space exploration, and biomedical fields. Here, we developed a new iEAP actuator utilizing high-purity single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs)-reinforced poly(3, 4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/poly(4-styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT: PSS, PP) hybrid electrodes and a Nafion/EMIBF4 ion-exchange membrane via a straightforward and efficient spray printing technique. The SWCNT/PP actuator exhibits significantly enhanced electric conductivity (262.9 S/cm) and specific capacitance (22.5 mF/cm2), benefitting from the synergistic effect between SWCNTs and PP. These improvements far surpass those observed in activated carbon aerogel bucky-gel-electrode-based actuators. Furthermore, we evaluated the electroactive behaviors of the SWCNT/PP actuator under alternating square-wave voltages (1–3 V) and frequencies (0.01–100 Hz). The results reveal a substantial bending displacement of 6.44 mm and a high bending strain of 0.61% (at 3 V, 0.1 Hz), along with a long operating stability of up to 10,000 cycles (at 2 V, 1 Hz). This study introduces a straightforward and efficient spray printing technique for the successful preparation of iEAP actuators with superior electrochemical and electromechanical properties as intended, which hold promise as artificial muscles in the field of bionic robotics.},

ABSTRACT = {Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) have emerged as viable micro power sources for an array of applications. Since their inception in 2012, TENGs have been the subject of significant advancements in terms of structural design and the development of friction materials. Despite these advancements, the complexity of their structural designs and the use of costly friction materials hinder their practical application. This study introduces a simplified TENG model utilizing an economical composite film of fullerene carbon soot (FS)-doped polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) (FS-TENG). It confirms the FS-TENG’s ability to convert mechanical energy into electrical energy, as demonstrated through experimental validation. The generated electricity by the FS-TENG can power devices such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs), digital watches, kitchen timers, and sports stopwatches, highlighting its efficiency. This research enhances the development of TENGs featuring low-cost, streamlined structures for sustainable and autonomous energy sensing applications.},

ABSTRACT = {Corrosion behavior is critical to the application of lightweight aluminum/steel joints using new resistance spot welding (RSW) technology. The study investigated the corrosion mechanism and the shear strength of RSW joints comprising 1.2 mm 5182 aluminum and 1.5 mm DP780 galvanized steel. Electrochemical corrosion tests were conducted on the base materials and various positions of the welds in a 3.5% NaCl solution. This result revealed that the corrosion susceptibility of the interfacial intermetallic compound (IMC) layer was not accelerated by the aluminum nugget because of the noble corrosion potential. Subsequently, the spray acceleration test was employed to investigate the corrosion mechanism. It is noteworthy that microcracks, as well as regions enriched with silicon and oxygen at the interface front, are preferential to corrosion during salt spray exposure, instead of the IMC layer. Moreover, the shear strength of the joints decreases with the reduction in the effective joint area after the salt spray exposure of the weld joints. This research systematically explored the corrosion behavior and its relationship with the mechanical properties of Al alloy/steel RSW joints.},

ABSTRACT = {The essence of drug delivery is to use an appropriate carrier that delivers the active substance to the appropriate pathogenic site at a specific time. This study aims to develop a novel drug carrier characterized by the controlled and targeted release of risedronate (RSD). The search for new routes to deliver RSD is important because oral delivery has many disadvantages. The carrier proposed in this work is composed of gelatin, polyphosphates, and zinc. The zinc contained in the carrier is responsible for coordinating the drug. The resulting material releases RSD in a controlled manner. The rate of delivery of the substance to the body depends on the pH of the environment. This study investigated the delivery of RSD in a neutral environment, where the process exhibited a prolonged and consistent release rate. This process has also been studied in an acidic environment, which accelerates the release of the drug. Mixed-environment studies were also conducted. Initially, the drug was released in a neutral environment, and then the conditions rapidly changed to acidic. In this case, the carrier demonstrated high stability and controlled release, adapting the rate of drug release to the prevailing environmental conditions. The presented results indicate the great potential of the new gelatin-based carrier in the delivery of risedronate.},

ABSTRACT = {This study investigates the impact of lignin on the durability and performance of polypropylene-based biocomposites (PP–flax and PP–pine) under environmental stresses such as UV radiation and moisture. The findings indicate that pine fibres, with their higher lignin content, are significantly more resistant to thermal degradation than flax fibres. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) showed that lignin influences crystallinity and melting temperatures across the composites, with variations corresponding to fibre type. Acoustic emissions analysis revealed that increasing the lignin content in pine fibres effectively reduces surface microcracks under UV exposure. Overall, these results underscore the importance of fibre composition in improving the performance and longevity of biocomposites, making them better suited for durable construction applications.},

ABSTRACT = {(Fe,Co)2(P,Si) quaternary compounds combine large uniaxial magnetocrystalline anisotropy, significant saturation magnetization and tunable Curie temperature, making them attractive for permanent magnet applications. Single crystals or conventionally prepared bulk polycrystalline (Fe,Co)2(P,Si) samples do not, however, show a significant coercivity. Here, after a ball-milling stage of elemental precursors, we optimize the sintering temperature and duration during the solid-state synthesis of bulk Fe1.85Co0.1P0.8Si0.2 compounds so as to obtain coercivity in bulk samples. We pay special attention to shortening the heat treatment in order to limit grain growth. Powder X-ray diffraction experiments demonstrate that a sintering of a few minutes is sufficient to form the desired Fe2P-type hexagonal structure with limited secondary-phase content (~5 wt.%). Coercivity is achieved in bulk Fe1.85Co0.1P0.8Si0.2 quaternary compounds by shortening the heat treatment. Surprisingly, the largest coercivities are observed in the samples presenting large amounts of secondary-phase content (>5 wt.%). In addition to the shape of the virgin magnetization curve, this may indicate a dominant wall-pining coercivity mechanism. Despite a tenfold improvement of the coercive fields for bulk samples, the achieved performances remain modest (HC ≈ 0.6 kOe at room temperature). These results nonetheless establish a benchmark for future developments of (Fe,Co)2(P,Si) compounds as permanent magnets.},

ABSTRACT = {Injection molding technology is widely utilized across various industries for its ability to fabricate complex-shaped components with exceptional dimensional accuracy. However, challenges related to injection quality often arise, necessitating innovative approaches for improvement. This study investigates the influence of surface roughness on the efficiency of conformal cooling channels produced using additive manufacturing technologies, specifically Direct Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS) and Atomic Diffusion Additive Manufacturing (ADAM). Through a combination of experimental measurements, including surface roughness analysis, scanning electron microscopy, and cooling system flow analysis, this study elucidates the impact of surface roughness on coolant flow dynamics and pressure distribution within the cooling channels. The results reveal significant differences in surface roughness between DMLS and ADAM technologies, with corresponding effects on coolant flow behavior. Following that fact, this study shows that when cooling channels’ surface roughness is lowered up to 90%, the reduction in coolant media pressure is lowered by 0.033 MPa. Regression models are developed to quantitatively describe the relationship between surface roughness and key parameters, such as coolant pressure, Reynolds number, and flow velocity. Practical implications for the optimization of injection molding cooling systems are discussed, highlighting the importance of informed decision making in technology selection and post-processing techniques. Overall, this research contributes to a deeper understanding of the role of surface roughness in injection molding processes and provides valuable insights for enhancing cooling system efficiency and product quality.},

ABSTRACT = {High-strength low-alloy steels are widely used, but their traditional heat-treatment process is complex, energy-intensive, and makes it difficult to fully exploit the material’s potential. In this paper, the electropulsing processing technology was applied to the quenching and tempering process of ZG25SiMn2CrB steel. Through microstructural characterization and mechanical property testing, the influence of electropulsing on the solid-state phase transition process of annealing steel was systematically studied. The heating process of the specimen with the annealing state (initial state) is the diffusion-type transition. As the discharge time increased, the microstructure gradually transformed from ferrite/pearlitic to slate martensite. Optimal mechanical properties and fine microstructure were achieved after quenching at 500 ms. The steel subjected to rapid tempering with 160 ms electropulsing exhibited good, comprehensive mechanical properties (tensile strength 1609 MPa, yield strength 1401.27 MPa, elongation 11.63%, and hardness 48.68 HRC). These favorable mechanical properties are attributed to the coupled impact of thermal and non-thermal effects induced by high-density pulse current. Specifically, the thermal effect provides the thermodynamic conditions for phase transformation, while the non-thermal effect reduces the nucleation barrier of austenite, which increases the nucleation rate during instantaneous heating, and the following rapid cooling suppresses the growth of austenite grains. Additionally, the fine microstructure prevents the occurrence of temper brittleness.},

ABSTRACT = {This study investigates utilizing spherical polystyrene (PS) beads as artificial flaws to improve ultrahigh-performance concrete (UHPC) tensile performance using a uniaxial tensile test and explains the corresponding mechanisms by analyzing the internal material structure of UHPC specimens with X-ray CT scanning. With a hooked steel fiber volume fraction of 2%, three PS bead dosages were employed to study tensile behavior changes in dog-bone UHPC specimens. A 33.4% increase in ultimate tensile strength and 174.8% increase in ultimate tensile strain were recorded after adding PS beads with a volume fraction of 2%. To explain this improvement, X-ray CT scanning was utilized to investigate the post-test internal material structures of the dog-bone specimens. AVIZO software was used to analyze the CT information. The CT results revealed that PS beads could not only serve as the artificial flaws to increase the cracking behavior of the matrix of UHPC but also significantly optimize the fiber orientation. The PS beads could serve as stirrers during the mixing process to distribute fiber more uniformly. The test results indicate a relationship between fiber orientation and UHPC tensile strength.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper explores the thermal behavior of multiple interface cracks situated between a half-plane and a thermal coating layer when subjected to transient thermal loading. The temperature distribution is analyzed using the hyperbolic heat conduction theory. In this model, cracks are represented as arrays of thermal dislocations, with densities calculated via Fourier and Laplace transformations. The methodology involves determining the temperature gradient within the uncracked region, and these calculations contribute to formulating a singular integral equation specific to the crack problem. This equation is subsequently utilized to ascertain the dislocation densities at the crack surface, which facilitates the estimation of temperature gradient intensity factors for the interface cracks experiencing transient thermal loading. This paper further explores how the relaxation time, loading parameters, and crack dimensions impact the temperature gradient intensity factors. The results can be used in fracture analysis of structures operating at high temperatures and can also assist in the selection and design of coating materials for specific applications, to minimize the damage caused by temperature loading.},

ABSTRACT = {Precast ultra-high-performance concrete (UHPC) has emerged as indispensable in the engineering sector due to its cost-effectiveness and superior performance. Currently, precast UHPC grapples with challenges pertaining to slow setting times and insufficient early strength, largely attributed to its high water-reducing agent content. Effective utilization of early strength agents to augment UHPC’s early strength is pivotal in addressing this issue. This study investigates the efficacy of two distinct concrete early strength agents, namely calcium formate (Ca(HCO2)2) and aluminum sulfate (Al2(SO4)3). A UHPC system with a water/cement ratio of 0.17 was used; both single and compound doping experiments were conducted using varied dosages of the aforementioned early strength agents. Our results show that both early strength agents significantly reduce setting time and enhance early strength at appropriate dosages. Specifically, the addition of 0.3% Ca(HCO2)2 led to a 33.07% decrease in setting time for UHPC. Moreover, the incorporation of 0.3% Ca(HCO2)2 and 0.5% Al2(SO4)3 resulted in a strength of 81.9 MPa at 1.5 days, representing a remarkable increase of 118.4%. It is noteworthy that excessive use of Ca(HCO2)2 inhibits the hydration process, whereas an abundance of Al2(SO4)3 diminishes the early strength effect. Simultaneously, this article provides recommendations regarding the dosage of two distinct early strength agents, offering a novel solution for expediting the production of prefabricated UHPC with a low water/cement ratio and high water-reducing agent content.},

Transition-metal selenite hydrates (specifically nickel and cobalt) have shown potential as solar absorbers with high evaporation rates of 1.83 and 2.34 kg∙m−2∙h−1, but the reported discrepancy in evaporation rate deserves further investigation. This investigation aims to clarify their thermal stability for applications and determine the underlying mechanisms responsible for the differences. Nickel and cobalt selenite hydrate compositions were synthesized and investigated via thermogravimetric analysis, X-ray diffraction, and Raman spectroscopy to assess their temperature-induced structural and compositional variations. The results reveal distinct phase transitions and structural alterations under various temperature conditions for these two photothermal materials, providing valuable insights into the factors influencing water transportation and evaporation rates.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper presents the influence of adding rinsed ilmenite mud waste (R-MUD) on the microstructure of Portland cement composites, compared to similar composites containing fly ash (FA). The aim of the study is the assessment of the pozzolanic activity of ilmenite mud waste by its impact on the microstructure of the cement matrix in comparison to the undoubted pozzolanic activity of fly ash. The presented test results include pore size distribution, phase composition, pozzolanic activity using thermal analysis, R3 bound water test, and microstructural analysis using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Tests were performed on mortars cured for up to 360 days. The results presented in this paper have shown that R-MUD has a pozzolanic activity level similar to FA or better, which influences pore size distribution in the composite and its microstructure. During the curing process, the microstructure of composites containing R-MUD became more compact and sealed than those with FA, which might also increase their durability. The results of the R3 tests have proven the pozzolanic activity of R-MUD but its level was lower than FA. R-MUD might be a useful substitute for fly ash, especially given the lack of good-quality fly ash on the market.},

ABSTRACT = {Cross-Laminated Timber (CLT) and concrete composite structures represent an architectural system that integrates the strengths of both materials. In this innovative configuration, the CLT and concrete collaborate synergistically, harnessing their individual merits to achieve enhanced structural performance and functionality. Specifically, the CLT offers a lightweight design, superior bending resistance, and immense engineering plasticity, while concrete boasts exceptional compressive strength and durability. This study investigates the mechanical performance of CLT­–concrete composite structures through quasi-static reciprocating loading tests in three full-scale CLT shear wall samples. Designed with varying initial prestressing forces and dimensions of the CLT panel, the prestressed CLT–concrete structures demonstrated a reduced dependence on the steel nodes, resulting in an increase in yield load, yield displacement, and maximum load-carrying capacity. Maximum capacity increased by 39.8% and 33.7% under initial prestressing forces of 23 kN and 46 kN on steel strands. Failure occurred due to localized compressive failure on prestressed steel strands and anchor plates. ABAQUS finite element analysis established three refined models, revealing that the increased initial prestressing force moderately enhanced stiffness but reduced ductility under similar cross-sectional dimensions. Furthermore, under consistent CLT material, dimensions, prestressing force, and loading conditions, prestressed CLT–concrete structures exhibited a higher maximum load-bearing capacity than prestressed CLT–steel composite structures. This study proposes structural design recommendations based on experimental and simulation results, incorporating specific assumptions.},

This has been recognized internationally, prompting the implementation of large-scale legislative measured aimed at its resolution; for example, an ambitious recycling quote has been established in the Critical Raw Materials Act Successful recycling in sufficient quantities is challenged by product designs that do not allow the extraction and recycling of these high-performance permanent magnets without excessive effort and cost. This is particularly true for smaller motors using NdFeB magnets. Therefore, methods of recycling such arrangements with little or no dismantling are being researched. They are tested for the hydrogen-processing of magnetic scrap (HPMS) method, a short-loop mechanical recycling process. As contamination of the recycled material with residues of anti-corrosion coatings, adhesives, etc., may lead to downcycling, the separability of such residues from bulk magnets and magnet powder is explored. It is found that the hydrogen permeability, expansion volume, and the chosen coating affect the viable preparation and separation methods as recyclability-relevant design features.},

ABSTRACT = {Lightweight and high-strength insulation materials have important application prospects in the aerospace, metallurgical, and nuclear industries. In this study, a highly porous silica fiber reinforced phenolic resin matrix composite was prepared by vacuum impregnation and atmospheric drying using quartz fiber needled felt as reinforcement and anhydrous ethanol as a pore-making agent. The effects of curing agent content on the structure, composition, density, and thermal conductivity of the composite were studied. The mechanical properties of the composite in the xy direction and z direction were analyzed. The results showed that this process can also produce porous phenolic resin (PR) with a density as low as 0.291 g/cm3, where spherical phenolic resin particles are interconnected to form a porous network structure with a particle size of about 5.43 μm. The fiber-reinforced porous PR had low density (0.372~0.397 g/cm3) and low thermal conductivity (0.085~0.095 W/m·K). The spherical phenolic resin particles inside the composite were well combined with the fiber at the interface and uniformly distributed in the fiber lap network. The composite possessed enhanced mechanical properties with compressive strength of 3.5–5.1 MPa in the xy direction and appeared as gradual compaction rather than destruction as the strain reached 30% in the z direction. This research provides a lightweight and high-strength insulation material with a simple preparation process and excellent performance.},

ABSTRACT = {Antibiotic residues have been found to have potentially harmful effects on ecological and human health. Carbon nitride-based photocatalysts have widely focused on antibiotic photocatalytic degradation. Herein, we prepared Fe-modified g-C3N4 nanorod bunches (FCNBs) using chemical vapor co-deposition. Specifically, through the process of calcination, a blend of urea and chlorophyllin sodium iron salt underwent an intriguing transformation, resulting in the integration of Fe into the framework of the g-C3N4 nanorod cluster. The resulting photocatalyst exhibited remarkable stability and superior dispersibility. The prepared FCNBs had a unique structure, which was beneficial for increasing light absorption. Furthermore, the Fe species formed a chemical coordination with the g-C3N4 matrix, thereby altering the electronic structure of the matrix. This modification facilitated charge transfer, prolonged the carrier lifetime, and enhanced light absorption, all of which significantly increased the photocatalytic activity. The oxytetracycline degradation efficiency of FCNBs was 82.5%, and they demonstrated outstanding stability in cycle trials. This work introduces a promising photocatalyst for the degradation of antibiotics.},

ABSTRACT = {In this study, Silicon Carbide (SiC) nanoparticle-based serigraphic printing inks were formulated to fabricate highly sensitive and wide temperature range printed thermistors. Inter-digitated electrodes (IDEs) were screen printed onto Kapton® substrate using commercially avaiable silver ink. Thermistor inks with different weight ratios of SiC nanoparticles were printed atop the IDE structures to form fully printed thermistors. The thermistors were tested over a wide temperature range form 25 °C to 170 °C, exhibiting excellent repeatability and stability over 15 h of continuous operation. Optimal device performance was achieved with 30 wt.% SiC-polyimide ink. We report highly sensitive devices with a TCR of −0.556%/°C, a thermal coefficient of 502 K (β-index) and an activation energy of 0.08 eV. Further, the thermistor demonstrates an accuracy of ±1.35 °C, which is well within the range offered by commercially available high sensitivity thermistors. SiC thermistors exhibit a small 6.5% drift due to changes in relative humidity between 10 and 90%RH and a 4.2% drift in baseline resistance after 100 cycles of aggressive bend testing at a 40° angle. The use of commercially available low-cost materials, simplicity of design and fabrication techniques coupled with the chemical inertness of the Kapton® substrate and SiC nanoparticles paves the way to use all-printed SiC thermistors towards a wide range of applications where temperature monitoring is vital for optimal system performance.},

ABSTRACT = {The x%Ni/Sm2O3-MnO (x = 0, 10, 15, 20) catalysts derived from SmMn2O5 mullite were prepared by solution combustion and impregnation method; auto-thermal reforming (ATR) of acetic acid (HAc) for hydrogen production was used to explore the metal-support effect induced by Ni loadings on the catalytic reforming activity and product distribution. The 15%Ni/Sm2O3-MnO catalyst exhibited optimal catalytic performance, which can be due to the appropriate Ni loading inducing a strong metal–support interaction to form a stable Ni/Sm2O3-MnO active center, while side reactions, such as methanation and ketonization, were well suppressed. According to characterizations, Sm2O3-MnO mixed oxides derived from SmMn2O5 mullite were formed with oxygen vacancies; nevertheless, loading of Ni metal further promoted the formation of oxygen vacancies, thus enhancing adsorption and activation of oxygen-containing intermediate species and resulting in higher reactivity with HAc conversion near 100% and hydrogen yield at 2.62 mol-H2/mol-HAc.},

ABSTRACT = {In the present paper, composite thin films of barium strontium titanate (BaxSr1−xTiO3) with an acceptor modifier (magnesium oxide—MgO) were deposited on metal substrates (stainless steel type) using the sol–gel method. The composite thin films feature BaxSr1−xTiO3 ferroelectric solid solution as the matrix and MgO linear dielectric as the reinforcement, with MgO concentrations ranging from 1 to 5 mol%. Following thermal treatment at 650 °C, the films were analyzed for their impedance response. Experimental impedance spectra were modeled using the Kohlrausch–Williams–Watts function, revealing stretching parameters (β) in the range of approximately 0.78 to 0.89 and 0.56 to 0.90 for impedance and electric modulus formalisms, respectively. Notably, films modified with 3 mol% MgO exhibited the least stretched relaxation function. Employing the electric equivalent circuit method for data analysis, the “circle fit” analysis demonstrated an increase in capacitance from 2.97 × 10−12 F to 5.78 × 10−10 F with the incorporation of 3 mol% MgO into BST-based thin films. Further analysis based on Voigt, Maxwell, and ladder circuits revealed trends in resistance and capacitance components with varying MgO contents, suggesting non-Debye-type relaxation phenomena across all tested samples.},

ABSTRACT = {This work aims to evaluate the potential use of natural wastes (in particular, clam shells) to synthesize one of the most well-known and versatile materials from the phosphate mineral group, hydroxyapatite (HAP). The obtained material was characterized in terms of morphology and composition using several analytical methods (scanning electron microscopy—SEM, X-ray diffraction—XRD, X-ray fluorescence—XRF, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy—FTIR, thermal analysis—TGA, and evaluation of the porosity and specific surface characteristics by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller—BET method) in order to confirm the successful synthesis of the material and to evaluate the presence of potential secondary phases. The developed material was further doped with iron oxide (HAP-Fe) using a microwave-assisted method, and both materials were evaluated in terms of photocatalytic activity determined by the photodecomposition of methylene blue (MB) which served as a contaminant model. The best results (approx. 33% MB degradation efficiency, after 120 min. of exposure) were obtained for the hydroxyapatite material, superior to the HAP-Fe composite (approx. 27%). The utilization of hydroxyapatite obtained from clam shells underscores the importance of sustainable and eco-friendly practices in materials syntheses. By repurposing waste materials from the seafood industry, we not only reduce environmental impact, but also create a valuable resource with diverse applications, contributing to advancements in both healthcare and environmental protection.},

ABSTRACT = {Negative thermal expansion (NTE) ceramics Sm0.85Zn0.15MnO3 (SZMO) and ZrMgMo3O12 (ZMMO) were selected to prepare Sm0.85Zn0.15MnO3-ZrMgMo3O12/Al-20Si (SZMO-ZMMO/Al-20Si) composites using ball milling and vacuum heating-press sintering processes in this study. The synergistic effect of the SZMO and ZMMO NTE ceramic reinforcements on the microstructure, mechanical properties, and coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of the composites was investigated. The results show that the processes of ball milling and sintering did not induce the decomposition of SZMO or ZMMO NTE ceramic reinforcements, nor did they promote a reaction between the Al-20Si matrix and SZMO or ZMMO NTE ceramic reinforcements. However, the excessive addition of SZMO and ZMMO NTE ceramics led to their aggregation within the composite. Adding a small amount of SZMO in combination with ZMMO effectively increased hardness and yield strength while reducing CTE in the Al-20Si alloy. The improvement in strength was primarily provided by SZMO, while the inhibition effect on CTE was primarily provided by ZMMO. An evaluation parameter denoted as α was proposed to evaluate the synergy effects of SZMO and ZMMO NTE ceramic reinforcements on the mechanical properties and CTE of the composites. Based on this parameter, among all composites fabricated, adding 2.5 vol% SZMO NTE ceramic and 10 vol% ZMMO NTE ceramic resulted in an optimal balance between CTE and strength for these composites with a compressive yield strength of 349.72 MPa and a CTE of 12.55 × 10−6/K, representing a significant increase in yield strength by 79.20% compared to that of Al-20Si alloy along with a notable reduction in CTE by 26.44%.},

ABSTRACT = {Slag and fly ash (FA) are mostly used as precursors for the production of alkali-activated materials (AAMs). FA is the waste discharged by power plants, while slag and steel slag (SS) both belong to the iron and steel industry. The effects of SS and FA on the strength, microstructure, and volume stability of alkali-activated slag (AAS) materials with different water glass modulus (Ms) values were comparatively investigated. The results show that adding SS or FA decreases the compressive strength of AAS mortar, and the reduction effect of SS is more obvious at high Ms. SS or FA reduce the non-evaporable water content (Wn) of AAS paste. However, SS increases the long-term Wn of AAS paste at low Ms. The cumulative pore volume and porosity increase after adding SS or FA, especially after adding FA. The hydration products are mainly reticular C-(A)-S-H gels. Adding SS increases the Ca/Si ratio of C-(A)-S-H gel but decreases the Al/Si ratio. However, by mixing FA, the Ca/Si ratio is reduced and the Al/Si ratio is almost unchanged. The incorporation of SS or FA reduces the drying shrinkage of AAS mortar, especially when SS is added. Increasing Ms increases the compressive strength and improves the pore structure, and it significantly increases the drying shrinkage of all samples. This study provides theoretical guidance for the application of steel slag in the alkali-activated slag material.},

ABSTRACT = {Al–10%Si–2%Cu alloys have been widely used in high-value industries (e.g., aerospace and automobiles) because of their lower specific gravity; however, galvanic corrosion rendered these alloys to have poor corrosion resistance. Therefore, the microstructure and corrosion properties of Al–10%Si–2%Cu alloys were investigated with respect to the lanthanum (La) content. All Al alloy samples were synthesized using gravity casting, with added La contents of 0.00, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, and 1.00 wt%, and were characterized using microstructural characteristics analysis and electrochemical tests. Adding 0.5 wt% La (xLa-0.5) indicated the finest structure, which had a 4% lower α-Al area fraction than the La-free alloy (xLa-0). However, the area fraction of a 1 wt% La-added (xLa-1) alloy was 2.4% higher than that of xLa-0. The corrosion current density (Icorr) of the xLa-0.5 was 1.09 μA/cm2, representing a 68% decrease as compared to that of xLa-0, and xLa-0.5 reached the highest polarization resistance value (7.32 × 103 Ω·cm2). The improvement in corrosion resistance of xLa-0.5 was due to the rapid and dense formation of a passivation layer induced by its fine structure, as well as the precipitated phase by enhancing the dispersibility of Cu.},

ABSTRACT = {Prestressed pipe piles are common concrete components characterized by dense concrete structures and favorable mechanical properties, and thus, extensively used as coastal soft soil foundations. However, their durability in harsh environments has not been fully clarified. In this study, leachate from an actual landfill site was collected from the east coast of China as the corrosive medium, and the corrosion process was accelerated by electrifying prestressed pipe piles. The results demonstrated that the concentration of chloride ions in the concrete of the prestressed pile increased with the increase in corrosion time. Moreover, the experimental corrosion of these prestressed piles in the drying–wetting cycle proved to be the most severe. However, a protective layer of epoxy resin coating can effectively inhibit the diffusion of chloride ions into the interior of the piles. The final theoretical corrosion amounts of the piles were 1.55 kg, 1.20 kg, and 1.64 kg under immersion, epoxy resin protection, and a drying–wetting cycle environment. The application of epoxy resin reduced chloride penetration by 22.6%, and the drying–wetting cycle increased chloride penetration by 5.8%, respectively, with corresponding corrosion potentials following similar patterns. The actual corrosion depth of the welding seam was 3.20 mm, and there was a large corrosion allowance compared with the requirement (6.53 mm) for the ultimate bending moment. In summary, these prestressed piles exhibited good durability in a leachate environment.},

ABSTRACT = {This study examined the impact of sulfate and sulfate–chloride dry–wet cyclic erosion on the mechanical properties and microscopic pore structure of engineered cementitious composite (ECC) with recycled fine aggregate (RA). Uniaxial tensile tests and four-point bending tests were conducted to evaluate the mechanical properties of RAECC, while the resonance frequency ratio was used to assess the integrity of the specimens. Finally, X-ray computed tomography (X-CT) reconstruction was employed to analyze the erosion effects on the microscopic pore structure. The results showed that the uniaxial tensile strength and flexural strength of the RAECC specimens in corrosive solution first increased and then decreased, and the 5% Na2SO4 solution caused the most serious erosion of the specimens. The resonance frequency ratio of the specimens reached the peak value when they were subjected to dry–wet cycles 15 times in the 5% Na2SO4 solution. During the erosion process, the pore space of the specimen first decreased and then increased, and the number of pores increased. The erosion process is the result of the erosion products continuously filling and eventually destroying the pores, and the erosion damage produces a large number of new pores and poor sphericity, leading to a decline in mechanical properties.},

ABSTRACT = {An express method for assessing the effectiveness of lubricating compositions with nano-additives of various chemical compositions is proposed, and a joint analysis of experimental data on the changes in the value of wear and the level of damage to the surface layers of metallic friction pairs was performed. The variation in the current relative hardness of the sample’s surface, the variation in the current relative material damage level, the current value of wear, and the current level of the coefficient of friction were chosen as the key parameters to conduct a performance assessment. The level of material damage in the contact zone was determined using the parameters of the statistical law of hardness value scattering. Based on an analysis of data in the literature, it was observed that the structural changes occurring in metallic materials during long-term, cyclic, static, and frictional loading are correlated with changes in the statistical characteristics of the hardness scattering results. An experimental substantiation of the proposed method was carried out for steel-sliding friction pairs using lubricating compositions based on Greaseline Lithium BIO Rail 000 oil manufactured by AIMOL with nano-additives of copper, magnesium and aluminum alloys, graphite, and two grades of medium-carbon steel. According to the system of indicators presented in this research, the greatest efficiency (in terms of increasing the wear resistance of friction steel pairs) was achieved with lubricating compositions including nano-powder additives made of steel, which have lower hardness. For the friction experiments, where the determining factor was abrasive wear, such lubricants ensured minimal damage and wear to the friction surface, while the value of the friction coefficient was maintained at a level that is optimal for wheel–rail friction pairs.},

ABSTRACT = {Low-grade limestone (LGL) is not used to produce cement clinker, but this leftover material in cement quarries increases the water demand when used as a filler in concrete production. In this study, the effect of six commercial superplasticizers on the performance of cement mixes containing 35% LGL and 2% gypsum was investigated. The optimal doses of these superplasticizers were found in a range of different water/binder (w/b) ratios by conducting several Marsh cone and mini-slump tests. The addition of a superplasticizer with a higher active solid content produced a maximum cement flow, regardless of the w/b ratios. The LGL-based mortar samples admixed with this superplasticizer obtained a maximum compressive strength of about 36 MPa at the end of 28 days. SEM and XRD results showed the formation of a new calcium-rich mineral in their microstructure. These findings highlight the impact of the type and properties of superplasticizers on the performance of concrete mixes containing LGL as a supplementary cementitious material.},

ABSTRACT = {The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of micronization on the characteristics of black cumin pressing waste material. The basic composition, amino acid, and fatty acid content of the raw material—specifically, black cumin pressing waste material—were determined. The samples were micronized in a planetary ball mill for periods ranging from 0 to 20 min. The particle sizes of micronized samples of black cumin pressing waste material were then examined using a laser analyzer, the Mastersizer 3000. The structures of the produced micronized powders was examined by X-ray diffraction. Additionally, the FTIR (Fourier-transform infrared) spectra of the micronized samples were recorded. The measurement of phenolic and antiradical properties was conducted both before and after in vitro digestion, and the evaluation of protein digestibility and trypsin inhibition was also conducted. The test results, including material properties, suggest that micronization for 10 min dramatically reduced particle diameters (d50) from 374.7 to 88.7 µm, whereas after 20 min, d50 decreased to only 64.5 µm. The results obtained using FTIR spectroscopy revealed alterations, especially in terms of intensity and, to a lesser extent, the shapes of the bands, indicating a significant impact on the molecular properties of the tested samples. X-ray diffraction profiles revealed that the internal structures of all powders are amorphous, and micronization methods have no effect on the internal structures of powders derived from black cumin pressing waste. Biochemical analyses revealed the viability of utilizing micronized powders from black cumin pressing waste materials as beneficial food additives, since micronization increased total phenolic extraction and antiradical activity.},

ABSTRACT = {In this work, the tensile deformation mechanisms of the Fe55Co17.5Cr12.5Ni10Mo5−xCx-based medium-entropy alloy at room temperature (R.T.), 77 K, and 4.2 K are studied. The formation of micro-defects and martensitic transformation to delay the cryogenic fracture are observed. The results show that FeCoCrNiMo5−xCx-based alloys exhibit outstanding mechanical properties under cryogenic conditions. Under an R.T. condition, the primary contributing mechanism of strain hardening is twinning-induced plasticity (TWIP), whereas at 77 K and 4.2 K, the activation of martensitic transformation-induced plasticity (TRIP) becomes the main strengthening mechanism during cryogenic tensile deformation. Additionally, the carbide precipitation along with increased dislocation density can significantly improve yield and tensile strength. Furthermore, the marked reduction in stacking fault energy (SFE) at cryogenic temperatures can promote mechanisms such as twinning and martensitic transformations, which are pivotal for enhancing ductility under extreme conditions. The Mo4C1 alloy obtains the optimal strength–ductility combination at cryogenic-to-room temperatures. The tensile strength and elongation of the Mo4C1 alloy are 776 MPa and 50.5% at R.T., 1418 MPa and 71.2% in liquid nitrogen 77 K, 1670 MPa and 80.0% in liquid helium 4.2 K, respectively.},

ABSTRACT = {Hybrid lead iodide perovskites are promising photovoltaic and light-emitting materials. Extant literature data on the key optoelectronic and luminescent properties of hybrid perovskites indicate that these properties are affected by electron–phonon coupling, the dynamics of the organic cations, and the degree of lattice distortion. We report temperature-dependent Raman studies of BA2MAPb2I7 and BA2MA2Pb3I10 (BA = butylammonium; MA = methylammonium), which undergo two structural phase transitions. Raman data obtained in broad temperature (360–80 K) and wavenumber (1800–10 cm−1) ranges show that ordering of BA+ cations triggers the higher temperature phase transition, whereas freezing of MA+ dynamics occurs below 200 K, leading to the onset of the low-temperature phase transition. This ordering is associated with significant deformation of the inorganic sublattice, as evidenced by changes observed in the lattice mode region. Our results show, therefore, that Raman spectroscopy is a very valuable tool for monitoring the separate dynamics of different organic cations in perovskites, comprising “perovskitizer” and interlayer cations.},

ABSTRACT = {The composition of grain boundaries (GBs) determines their mechanical behavior, which in turn affects the mechanical properties of nanocrystalline materials. Inspired by GB segregation and the concept of high-entropy alloys (HEAs), we investigated, respectively, the mechanical responses of nanocrystalline Cu samples with and without multi-element GBs, as well as the grain size effects, aiming to explore the effects of GB composition decoration on mechanical properties. Our results show that introducing multi-element segregation GBs can significantly improve the mechanical properties of nanocrystalline Cu by effectively inhibiting GB migration and sliding. Additionally, we proposed an improved a theoretical model that can reasonably describe the strengths of the materials with multi-element or single-element segregation GBs. Notably, the introduction of multi-element segregation GBs inhibits both migration and sliding behavior, with migration being more effectively suppressed than sliding. These results present a novel approach for designing high-performance nanometallic materials and offer valuable insights into the role of GB composition decoration in enhancing mechanical properties.},

ABSTRACT = {Alumina ceramic is an ideal candidate for armor protection, but it is limited by the difficult molding or machining process. Three-dimensional printing imparts a superior geometric flexibility and shows good potential in the preparation of ceramics for armor protection. In this work, alumina ceramics were manufactured via 3D printing, and the effects of different monomers on the photosensitive slurry and sintered ceramics were investigated. The photosensitive slurries using dipropylene glycol diacrylate (DPGDA) as a monomer displayed the optimal curing performance, with a low viscosity, small volume shrinkage and low critical exposure energy, and each of the above properties was conducive to a good curing performance in 3D printing, making it a suitable formula for 3D-printed ceramic materials. In the 3D-printed ceramics with DPGDA as a monomer, a dense and uniform microstructure was exhibited after sintering. In comparison, the sample with trimethylolpropane triacrylate (TMPTA) showed an anisotropic microstructure with interlayer gaps and a porosity of about 9.8%. Attributed to the dense uniform microstructure, the sample with DPGDA exhibited superior properties, including a relative density of 97.5 ± 0.5%, a Vickers hardness of 19.4 ± 0.8 GPa, a fracture toughness of 2.6 ± 0.27 MPa·m1/2, a bending strength of 690 ± 54 MPa, and a dynamic strength of 3.7 ± 0.6 GPa at a strain rate of 1200 s−1.},

ABSTRACT = {Cavitation in micro-scale lubricating film could be determined by the fluid’s thermal properties, which impacts the hydrodynamic lubrication capacity dramatically. This study aimed to novelly investigate the impact of the thermal cavitation effect on the hydrodynamic performance of liquid face seals, employing the compressible cavitation model, viscosity–temperature effect, and energy equation. The finite difference method was adopted to analyze the thermal cavitation by calculating the pressure and temperature profiles of the lubricating film. The working conditions and geometric configuration of liquid face seals under different thermal cases were further studied to explore their effects on sealing performance. The results showed that thermal cavitation could reduce the temperature difference of liquid film at high speeds, and cavitation would be weakened under temperature gradients, which further dropped off the hydrodynamic performance. Contrary to the leakage rate, the opening forces tended to be lower with the increasing seal pressure and film thickness under high-temperature gradients. Furthermore, apart from the spiral angle of grooves, the hydrodynamic performance exhibited significant variation with increasing groove depth, number, and radius at high-temperature gradients, which meant that the thermal cavitation effect should be considered in the design of geometric grooves to obtain better hydrodynamic performance.},

ABSTRACT = {The term “desolvation inability” is proposed in order to describe the alteration of the original chemical structure of a solute (“decomposition”) prior to the solvent’s full removal upon the heating of the solvate. This behavior has been sporadically reported; however, it is much more frequent, and it is the basis of various, seemingly unrelated, effects/processes, e.g., the vinegar syndrome of cellulose acetate cinematographic films, in thermal energy storage. An explanation and a criterion/index for the prediction of this behavior are provided based on the comparison of the Gibbs free energies of decomposition and desolvation. A new approach for the expression of the Gibbs free energy of desolvation is proposed by reversing the roles of the solute and solvent and by regarding water as the solute rather than as the solvent, while the solute is treated as a solid solvent. This approach results in lower solvation/desolvation Gibbs free energy values. Based on the above, the experimentally observed thermal behavior of three inorganic hydrates is predicted and explained. Theoretically and experimentally, it is supported that decomposition is possible at sub-zero (°C) temperatures and the regarded simultaneous drying and protection of heat-sensitive substances by freeze-drying, at least in some cases, e.g., for the case of gallic acid, is an unverified myth.},

ABSTRACT = {Tensile tests were performed on Cu64Zr36 metallic glass at strain rates of 107/s, 108/s, and 109/s via classical molecular dynamics simulations to explore the underlying mechanism by which strain rate affects deformation behavior. It was found that strain rate has a great impact on the deformation behavior of metallic glass. The higher the strain rate is, the larger the yield strength. We also found that the strain rate changes the atomic structure evolution during deformation, but that the difference in the atomic structure evolution induced by different strain rates is not significant. However, the mechanical response under deformation conditions is found to be significantly different with the change in strain rate. The average von Mises strain of a system in the case of 107/s is much larger than that of 109/s. In contrast, more atoms tend to participate in deformation with increasing strain rate, indicating that the strain localization degree is more significant in cases of lower strain rates. Therefore, increasing the strain rate reduces the degree of deformation heterogeneity, leading to an increase in yield strength. Further analysis shows that the structural features of atomic clusters faded out during deformation as the strain rate increased, benefiting more homogeneous deformation behavior. Our findings provide more useful insights into the deformation mechanisms of metallic glass.},

ABSTRACT = {The static compaction technique emphasizes the reduced activator dosage required to develop geopolymers. Therefore, it is crucial to comprehend the optimal alkaline activator concentration for blending low-calcium precursor (fly ash) with high-calcium precursor (GGBS) to produce geopolymer blocks. This work was designed to optimize structural blocks’ compressive strength and durability. In experimentation, fly ash (FA) and slag (GGBS) proportions were initially investigated under NaOH solution with varying molarity (8–12) and curing conditions to develop a load-bearing structural block. Subsequently, the durability of the optimized block was evaluated over 56 days through subjection to sulfate and acidic solutions, with efflorescence monitored over the same period. The results reveal that the structural block comprised of 100% FA exhibits the highest compressive strength and lowest bulk density. Conversely, the block incorporating 25% slag that underwent hot curing demonstrates a remarkable 305% strength increase compared to ambient curing. Considering the physico-mechanical performance, the 100% FA block was chosen for durability investigation. The findings indicate a substantial strength loss exceeding 40% after exposure to sulfate and acidic environments over 56 days, coupled with pronounced efflorescence. Catastrophic failure occurs in all cases due to significant strength deterioration. The FTIR spectrum revealed the shifting of the wavenumber to a higher value and verified the depolymerization and leaching of alumina under acidic exposure. However, the developed geopolymer blocks demonstrate superior sustainability and feasibility compared to conventional fired clay bricks and cement-based FA bricks. Despite slightly higher costs, these blocks exhibit greater strength than their counterparts after enduring severe exposures.},

ABSTRACT = {A simple activation method has been used to obtain porous carbon material from walnut shells. The effect of the activation duration at 400 °C in an atmosphere with limited air access on the structural, morphological, and electrochemical properties of the porous carbon material obtained from walnut shells has been studied. Moreover, the structure and morphology of the original and activated carbon samples have been characterized by SAXS, low-temperature adsorption porosimetry, SEM, and Raman spectroscopy. Therefore, the results indicate that increasing the duration of activation at a constant temperature results in a reduction in the thickness values of interplanar spacing (d002) in a range of 0.38–0.36 nm and lateral dimensions of the graphite crystallite from 3.79 to 2.52 nm. It has been demonstrated that thermal activation allows for an approximate doubling of the specific SBET surface area of the original carbon material and contributes to the development of its mesoporous structure, with a relative mesopore content of approximately 75–78% and an average pore diameter of about 5 nm. The fractal dimension of the obtained carbon materials was calculated using the Frenkel–Halsey–Hill method; it shows that its values for thermally activated samples (2.52, 2.69) are significantly higher than for the original sample (2.17). Thus, the porous carbon materials obtained were used to fabricate electrodes for electrochemical capacitors. Electrochemical investigations of these cells in a 6 M KOH aqueous electrolyte were conducted by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge, and impedance spectroscopy. Consequently, it was established that the carbon material activated at 400 °C for 2 h exhibits a specific capacity of approximately 110–130 F/g at a discharge current density ranging from 4 to 100 mA/g.},

ABSTRACT = {In this study, we analysed the potential use of dried strawberry leaves and calyces for the production of nanoparticles using inorganic iron compounds. We used the following iron precursors FeCl3 × 6H2O, FeCl2 × 4H2O, Fe(NO3)3 × 9H2O, Fe2(SO4)3 × H2O, FeSO4 × 7H2O, FeCl3 anhydrous. It was discovered that the content of polyphenols and flavonoids in dried strawberries and their antioxidant activity in DPPH and FRAP were 346.81 µM TE/1 g and 331.71 µM TE/1 g, respectively, and were similar to these of green tea extracts. Microimages made using TEM techniques allowed for the isolation of a few nanoparticles with dimensions ranging from tens of nanometres to several micrometres. The value of the electrokinetic potential in all samples was negative and ranged from −21,300 mV to −11,183 mV. XRF analyses confirmed the presence of iron ranging from 0.13% to 0.92% in the samples with a concentration of 0.01 mol/dm3. FT-IR spectra analyses showed bands characteristic of nanoparticles. In calorimetric measurements, no increase in temperature was observed in any of the tests during exposure to the electromagnetic field. In summary, using the extract from dried strawberry leaves and calyxes as a reagent, we can obtain iron nanoparticles with sizes dependent on the concentration of the precursor.},

ABSTRACT = {The reduction in the rheological parameters and dissolution rate of precursors in geopolymer coatings during early hydration significantly contributes to sagging. This study aims to improve the sag resistance of these coatings by incorporating diatomite filler. Rheological testing was conducted to assess the impact of diatomite and its concentration on the yield stress, plastic viscosity, and thixotropy of the geopolymer coatings. The results indicated that diatomite’s large specific surface area and high reactivity have a significant influence on the rheological parameters and early dissolution rate of precursors. With a diatomite concentration of 1.1%, the coating exhibited a yield stress of 2.749 Pa and a plastic viscosity of 0.921 Pa·s, maintaining stability, homogeneity, and no sagging at a thickness of 600 μm. Furthermore, the highly active SiO2 in diatomite participates in the secondary hydration reaction of the geopolymer materials led to the formation of substantial C-(A)-S-H gel. This gel enhances internal interconnectivity within the coating, thereby improving its rheological and mechanical properties.},

ABSTRACT = {As the second-generation high-temperature superconducting conductors, rare earth–barium–copper–oxide (REBCO) coated conductor (CC) tapes have good potential as high-field and high-energy superconductors. In superconducting applications, several joints are required for conjugating comparatively short REBCO CC tapes. Soldering lap joints are the simplest and most commonly applied REBCO CC joints. In addition to joint resistance, the mechanical behavior and electromechanical properties are also crucial for superconducting applications. In this paper, the electromechanical properties and mechanical behaviors of soldering lap joints at 77 K under a self-field were studied. The mechanical behavior was addressed by using a full three-dimensional multilayer elastic–plastic finite element model (FEM) with REBCO CC tape main layers and solder connecting layers. Then, the electromechanical properties were analyzed by using Gao’s strain-Ic degradation general model on the basis of the FEM results. Both the mechanical behavior and electromechanical properties were verified by experimental results. The effects of soldering lap conditions including lap length, soldering thickness and lap style on the electromechanical properties and mechanical behaviors were discussed. The results indicate that shorter overlap lengths and a thinner solder can reduce the premature degradation of Ic due to stress concentrations nearby the joint edges; moreover, the irreversible critical strain is significantly higher in the back-to-back joint approach compared to the widely used face-to-face joint approach.},

ABSTRACT = {With additive manufacturing (AM) processes such as Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing (WAAM), components with complex shapes or with functional properties can be produced, with advantages in the areas of resource conservation, lightweight construction, and load-optimized production. However, proving component quality is a challenge because it is not possible to produce 100% defect-free components. In addition to this, statistically determined fluctuations in the wire quality, gas flow, and their interaction with process parameters result in a quality of the components that is not 100% reproducible. Complex testing procedures are therefore required to demonstrate the quality of the components, which are not cost-effective and lead to less efficiency. As part of the project “3DPrintFEM”, a sound emission analysis is used to evaluate the quality of AM components. Within the scope of the project, an approach was being developed to determine the quality of an AM part dependent not necessarily on its geometry. Samples were produced from WAAM, which were later cut and milled to precision. To determine the frequencies, the samples were put through a resonant frequency test (RFM). The unwanted modes were then removed from the spectrum produced by the experiments by comparing it with FEM simulations. Later, defects were introduced in experimental samples in compliance with the ISO 5817 guidelines. In order to create a database of frequencies related to the degree of the sample defect, they were subjected to RFM. The database was further augmented through frequencies from simulations performed on samples with similar geometries, and, hence, a training set was generated for an algorithm. A machine-learning algorithm based on regression modelling was trained based on the database to sort samples according to the degree of flaws in them. The algorithm’s detectability was evaluated using samples that had a known level of flaws which forms the test dataset. Based on the outcome, the algorithm will be integrated into an equipment developed in-house to monitor the quality of samples produced, thereby having an in-house quality assessment routine. The equipment shall be less expensive than conventional acoustic equipment, thus helping the industry cut costs when validating the quality of their components.},

ABSTRACT = {This study focuses on the heavily Mg-doped GaN in which the passivation effect of hydrogen and the compensation effect of nitrogen vacancies (VN) impede its further development. To investigate those two factors, H ion implantation followed by thermal annealing was performed on the material. The evolution of relevant defects (H and VN) was revealed, and their distinct behaviors during thermal annealing were compared between different atmospheres (N2/NH3). The concentration of H and its associated yellow luminescence (YL) band intensity decrease as the thermal annealing temperature rises, regardless of the atmosphere being N2 or NH3. However, during thermal annealing in NH3, the decrease in H concentration is notably faster compared to N2. Furthermore, a distinct trend is observed in the behavior of the blue luminescence (BL) band under N2 and NH3. Through a comprehensive analysis of surface properties, we deduce that the decomposition of NH3 during thermal annealing not only promotes the out-diffusion of H ions from the material, but also facilitates the repair of VN on the surface of heavily Mg-doped GaN. This research could provide crucial insights into the post-growth process of heavily Mg-doped GaN.},

ABSTRACT = {Graphene has attracted much interest in many scientific fields because of its high specific surface area, Young’s modulus, fracture strength, carrier mobility and thermal conductivity. In particular, the graphene oxide (GO) prepared by chemical exfoliation of graphite has achieved low-cost and large-scale production and is one of the most promising for Cu matrix composites. Here, we prepared a high strength, high electrical conductivity and high thermal conductivity reduced graphene oxide (RGO)/Cu composite by directly heating the GO/copper formate. The oxygen-containing functional groups and defects of RGO are significantly reduced compared with those of GO. The tensile yield strength and thermal conductivity of RGO/Cu composite with RGO volume fraction of 0.49 vol.% are as high as 553 MPa and 364 W/(m·K) at room temperature, respectively. The theoretical value of the tensile yield strength of the composite is calculated according to the strengthening mechanism, and the result shows that it agrees with the experimental value. After hot-rolling treatment, the ductility and conductivity of the composite materials have been greatly improved, and the ductility of the RGO/Cu composite with RGO volume fraction of 0.49 vol.% has been increased to four times the original. This work provides a highly efficient way to fabricate a high-performance RGO-reinforced Cu composite for commercial application.},

ABSTRACT = {The purpose of the present study was to perform a preliminary analysis of the fitting of different fiber-reinforced composite (GFRC) posts to tooth root canals and determine the resin cement layer thickness. The following GFRC posts were assessed: bundle posts (Rebilda GTTM, VOCO, Germany), sleeve system (SAPTM, Angelus Ind, Brazil), and accessory posts (ReforpinTM, Angelus, Brazil). Twenty-four freshly extracted mandibular single-rooted pre-molars were endodontically treated and divided into six groups, according to the type of GFRC post and resin cement (self-adhesive or conventional dual-cured). Then, specimens were cross-sectioned and inspected by optical microscopy regarding the cement layer thickness and presence of defects such as pores, voids, or fissures were assessed. Bundle and accessory posts revealed a regular distribution of resin cement with a lower number of voids than found with sleeve systems. The sleeve system posts showed poor fitting at the apical portion of the root canals. The type of resin cement did not affect the thickness of the interface, although both bundle and accessory posts allow a better distribution of resin cement and fibers. The present preliminary study reveals interesting insights on the fitting of bundle and accessory posts to root dentin and resin cement layer thickness in oval-shape root canals. The sleeve system posts showed adequate fitting only at the coronal portion of the canals.},

ABSTRACT = {This study evaluates the enhancement of laser welding using ultrasonic waves aimed at reorganising the intermetallic position in such a fashion that leads to increased mechanical properties of welds in battery pack assemblies for electric vehicles. The experiment employed 20 kHz and 40 kHz High-Power Ultrasound Transducers (HPUTs) in both contact and contactless modes. A simplified experimental configuration is suggested to represent conditions similar to those found in electric vehicle battery pack assemblies. Measurements of vibration transmission to aluminium alloy 1050 plates revealed more than a 1000-fold increase in acceleration amplitude in contact mode compared to contactless mode. The 20 kHz transducer in contactless mode demonstrated superior performance, showing a 10% increase in load and 27% increase in extension compared to welding without ultrasonic assistance. On the other hand, the 40 kHz transducer, while still improved over non-ultrasonic methods, showed less pronounced benefits. This suggests that lower-frequency ultrasonic assistance (20 kHz) is more effective in this specific context. The study explores ultrasonic assistance in laser welding copper (Cu101) to aluminium alloy 1050 using 20 kHz and 40 kHz HPUTs, showing that both transducers enhance microstructural integrity by reducing copper homogenisation into aluminium, with the 20 kHz frequency proving more effective in this context. A numerical simulation was conducted to evaluate the transmission of pressure into the molten pool of the weld, correlated with the vibration results obtained from the 20 kHz transducer. The numerical simulation confirms that no cavitation is initiated in the molten pool area, and all improvements are solely due to the ultrasonic waves.},

ABSTRACT = {To address the issue of pavement cracking due to brittle concrete in road and bridge engineering, this study explores the use of high−ductility magnesium phosphate cementitious concrete (HD−MPCC) for rapid repairs. The deformation and frost properties of HD−MPCC are analyzed to assess its suitability for this application. Deformation properties were tested for HD−MPCC specimens cured in both air and water. Subsequent tests focused on the frost performance and mechanical properties after freeze–thaw cycles. A mercury penetration technique was utilized to examine the pore structure. The findings reveal that the expansion deformation of HD−MPCC increases with curing age in both air and water conditions, and the quantitative relationship between the expansion deformation and curing age of HD−MPCC was analyzed. Additionally, the freeze–thaw cycles led to a decrease in mass loss, the relative dynamic elastic modulus, the ultimate tensile strength, the ultimate tensile strain, the flexural strength, and the peak deflection. The volume fraction of harmless and less harmful pores gradually decreased as the freeze–thaw cycle increased, while the volume fraction of more harmful pores increased, resulting in a decrease in the strength, ultimate tensile strain, and peak deflection.},

ABSTRACT = {The aggregation of graphene oxide (GO) during the hydration process limits its wide application. Polymer superplasticizers have been used to improve the dispersion state of GO due to their adsorption and site-blocking effects, though the formation of a large amount of foam during the mixing process weakens the mechanical properties of cement. A highly dispersed amphoteric polycarboxylate superplasticizer-stabilized graphene oxide (APC/GO) toughening agent was prepared by electrostatic self-assembly. Results demonstrate that the APC/GO composite dispersed well in a cement pore solution due to the steric effect offered by the APC. Additionally, the well-dispersed GO acted as an antifoaming agent in the cement since GO nanosheets can be absorbed at the air–liquid interface of APC foam via electrostatic interactions and eliminate the air-entraining effect. The well-dispersed APC/GO sheets promoted cement hydration and further refined its pore structure owing to the nucleation effect. The flexural and compressive strength of the cement containing the APC/GO composite were enhanced by 21.51% and 18.58%, respectively, after a 7-day hydration process compared with a blank sample. The improved hydration degree, highly polymerized C-S-H gel, and refined pore structure provided enhanced mechanical properties.},

ABSTRACT = {In engineering, the stress state of expanded tubes is crucial for ensuring structural integrity and preventing stress corrosion cracking. The analysis of stresses and strains in tubes subjected to mechanical expansion using an ogive bullet is essential, yet existing theoretical methods for estimating the stress distributions, especially with spherical and ogive shapes, are sparse. This study explores the expansion of 3/8 inch copper and stainless-steel tubes using an expanding bullet, where tangential and longitudinal strains are measured. A novel analytical approach is introduced to evaluate the stresses and strains, segmenting the tube into three zones, each analyzed with a distinct theory. Validation is achieved through an axisymmetric finite element model that employs a multi-linear kinematic hardening material behavior. The analytical model also estimates the expanding mandrel’s push force, which is then compared with the results from numerical simulations and experimental data, showing good agreement across methods.},

Axle steel, like 42CrMo, is widely used in many types of axles and shafts; however, there is no existing research on rotary-swaged axle steel’s mechanical properties. It makes sense to carry out a comprehensive study on the effect of RS on the mechanical behaviors of axle steel rods. In this study, a 42CrMo steel rod was processed by RS through ten passes. The tensile properties, torsion properties, compression properties, and fatigue properties were tested. There was an overall improvement in the torsional and fatigue performance after RS. Combined with a finite element analysis (FEM), the uneven distribution of the dislocations and existence of the elongation material were inferred to have caused the different modes of the mechanical behaviors. Fracture surfaces were analyzed and the results showed that the fracture pattern had changed. There existed a competitive relation between the internal fatigue cracks and external cracks, which could be attributed to uneven strain hardening. This research proved the advantages of RS in the processing of axle parts, which mainly benefitted the torsional working conditions, and provided evidence for a new processing route for lightweight axles with RS.},

ABSTRACT = {A complex of the natural flavonoid kaempferol with zinc (Kam-Zn) was synthesized, and its physicochemical properties were investigated using spectroscopic methods such as Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), ultraviolet–visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy and theoretical chemistry. Biological studies were conducted to evaluate the cytotoxic and antiproliferative effects of these complexes on MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Treatment with Kam 100 µM (84.86 ± 7.79%; 64.37 ± 8.24%) and Kam-Zn 100 µM (91.87 ± 3.80%; 87.04 ± 13.0%) showed no significant difference in proliferation between 16 h and 32 h, with the gap width remaining stable. Both Kam-Zn 100 μM and 200 μM demonstrated effective antiproliferative and cytotoxic activity, significantly decreasing cell viability and causing cell death and morphology changes. Antioxidant assays revealed that Kam (IC50 = 5.63 ± 0.06) exhibited higher antioxidant potential compared to Kam-Zn (IC50 = 6.80 ± 0.075), suggesting that zinc coordination impacts the flavonoid’s radical scavenging activity by the coordination of metal ion to hydroxyl groups. Computational studies revealed significant modifications in the electronic structure and properties of Kam upon forming 1:1 complexes with Zn2+ ions. Spectroscopy analyses confirmed structural changes, highlighting shifts in absorption peaks and alterations in functional group vibrations indicative of metal–ligand interactions. FT-IR and UV-Vis spectra analysis suggested that Zn coordinates with the 3-OH and 4C=O groups of ligand. These findings suggest that the Kam-Zn complex exhibits interesting antiproliferative, cytotoxic and modified antioxidant effects on MCF-7 cells, providing valuable insights into their structural and anticancer properties.},

ABSTRACT = {Elastic composites were prepared using a procedure involving hot plates and zinc powder that was directly dispersed into an EVA matrix. The correlation between the zinc content and the conductive properties of the material was studied via impedance spectroscopy, the thermal properties of the material were studied via differential calorimetry and the mechanical properties of the composites were studied via tensile strength curves, representing an important advancement in the characterization of this type of composite material. The composites’ tensile strength and elongation at break decrease with the addition of filler since zinc particles act as stress-concentrating centres, while the composites’ hardness and Young’s modulus increase because of an increase in the stiffness of the material. The AC perturbation across the EVA/Zn composites was characterized using an RC parallel equivalent circuit that allowed us to easily measure their resistivity (ρp) and permittivity (εp). The dependence of these electrical magnitudes on the zinc content is correlated with their mechanical properties across the characteristic time constant τp =  ρp·εp of this equivalent circuit. The dependence of the mechanical and electrical magnitudes on the zinc content is consistent with the formation of percolation clusters. The addition of graphite particles increases their potential performance. Three possible mechanisms for the electrical transport of the ac-perturbation across the EVA/Zn composites have been identified. Chemical corrosion in acid media causes the loss of zinc surface particles, but their bulk physical properties practically remain constant.},

ABSTRACT = {Aluminum alloy plates are widely used to manufacture large-scale integral structure parts in the field of aerospace. During the forming and processing of aluminum alloy plates, different degrees of residual stress are inevitably produced. Fast and accurate detection of residual stress is very essential to ensuring the quality of these plates. In this work, the longitudinal critically refracted (LCR) wave detection method based on a one-transmitter and double-receiver (OTDR) transducer and the finite element simulation were employed to obtain the residual stress. Aluminum alloy plates with different deformation amounts were fabricated by rotary forging to obtain different residual stress states. Results reveal that the plate formed by rotary forging is in a stress state of central tension and edge compression. As the deformation increases from 20% to 60%, the peak residual tensile stress increases from 156 MPa to 262 MPa, and there is no significant difference in the peak compressive stress. When the deformation reaches 60%, the difference in the residual stresses at different depths is less than 13%, which indicates that the plastic deformation zone basically penetrates the entire longitudinal cross-section of the plate. The maximum deviation between measurement and FE is 61 MPa, which means the experimental data are in good agreement with the FE results.},

ABSTRACT = {Photocatalysis performs excellently when degrading organic pollutants, but the photocatalytic degradation rate is not high for most photocatalysts due to their narrow sunlight adsorption range and high recombination rate of electron hole pairs. Herein, we use V2C-MXene with a wide sunlight adsorption range to couple ZnO porous nanosheets and form ZnO/MXene hybrids using a facile electrostatic self-assembly method. The ZnO/MXene hybrids acquired demonstrated improved photochemical efficiency in breaking down methylene blue (MB) when contrasted with porous ZnO nanosheets. The degradation rate of MB reached 99.8% under UV irradiation for 120 min after the ZnO/MXene hybrid formation, while 38.6% was attained by the ZnO porous nanosheets. Moreover, photodegradation rate constants (k) were calculated as 3.05 × 10−3 and 5.42 × 10−2 min−1 for ZnO porous nanosheets and ZnO/MXene hybrids, respectively, indicating that the photodegradation performance was enhanced by 17.8 times after the modification of V2C. This was probably because the modification of V2C can increase the specific surface area to provide more sites for MB adsorption, widen the sunlight adsorption range to produce good photothermal effect, and facilitate the transfer of photogenerated carriers in ZnO to promote the reaction of more photogenerated carriers with MB. Hence, this work offers a simple approach to creating effective photocatalysts for breaking down organic contaminants.},

The substitution of Te4+ for Zr in Rb2ZrCl6 was investigated to examine the effect of Te4+ doping on the spectral properties of Rb2ZrCl6 and its potential applications. The incorporation of Te4+ induced yellow emission of triplet self-trapped emission (STE). Different luminescence wavelengths were regulated by Te4+ concentration and excitation wavelength, and under a low concentration of Te4+ doping (x ≤ 0.1%), different types of host STE emission and Te4+ triplet state emission could be achieved through various excitation energies. These luminescent properties made it suitable for applications in information encryption. When Te4+ was doped at high concentrations (x ≥ 1%), yellow triplet state emission of Te4+ predominated, resulting in intense yellow emission, which stemmed from strong exciton binding energy and intense electron-phonon coupling. In addition, a Rb2ZrCl6:2%Te4+@RTV scintillating film was fabricated and a spatial resolution of 3.7 lp/mm was achieved, demonstrating the potential applications of Rb2ZrCl6:xTe4+ in nondestructive detection and bioimaging.},

ABSTRACT = {Through the study of the thermal rheological behavior of Ti6Al4V alloy at different temperatures (500 °C, 600 °C, 700 °C, and 800 °C) and different strain rates (0.1 s−1, 0.05 s−1, 0.01 s−1, and 0.005 s−1), a constitutive model was developed for Ti6Al4V alloy across a wide temperature range in the hot stamping process. The model’s correlation coefficient reached 0.9847, indicating its high predictive accuracy. Hot processing maps suitable for the hot stamping process of Ti6Al4V alloy were developed, demonstrating the significant impact of the strain rate on the hot formability of Ti6Al4V alloy. At higher strain rates (>0.05 s−1), the hot processing of Ti6Al4V alloy is less prone to instability. Combining hot processing maps with hot stamping experiments, it was found that the forming quality and thickness uniformity of parts improved significantly with the increase in stamping speed. The phase composition and microstructures of the forming parts under different heating temperature conditions have been investigated using SEM, EBSD, XRD, and TEM, and the maximum heating temperature of hot stamping forming was determined to be 875 °C. The recrystallization mechanism in hot stamping of Ti6Al4V alloys was proposed based on EBSD tests on different sections of a hot stamping formed box-shaped component. With increasing deformation, the effect of dynamic recrystallization (DRX) was enhanced. When the thinning rate reached 15%, DRX surpassed dynamic recovery (DRV) as the dominant softening mechanism. DRX grains at different thinning rates were formed through both discontinuous dynamic recrystallization (DDRX) and continuous dynamic recrystallization (CDRX), with CDRX always being the dominant mechanism.},

ABSTRACT = {Recycled concrete is a heterogeneous composite material, and the composition and volume fraction of each phase affect its macroscopic properties. In this paper, ANSYS APDL was used to construct a two-dimensional numerical model of recycled aggregate concrete with different replacement rates of recycled aggregate (0%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100%), and a uniaxial compression test was carried out to explore the relationship between recycled aggregate content and its macroscopic mechanical behavior. On this basis, the numerical simulation of different strain rates (0.1 s−1, 0.05 s−1, 0.01 s−1, 0.005 s−1 and 0.001 s−1) was carried out. It was found that with the increase in the recycled aggregate replacement rate, the peak stress decreases first and then increases, and the peak strain increases continuously. When the replacement rate of recycled aggregate exceeds 50%, the overall damage area of the material increases rapidly. The strain rate will change the path of the micro-crack initiation and expansion of recycled concrete, as well as the process of damage accumulation and evolution. As a result, the unit area and shape of recycled concrete are different at different strain rates, and the damage degree of each phase material is also different.},

ABSTRACT = {Hydrogen energy is the clean energy with the most potential in the 21st century. The microchannel reactor for methanol steam reforming (MSR) is one of the effective ways to obtain hydrogen. Ceramic materials have the advantages of high temperature resistance, corrosion resistance, and high mechanical strength, and are ideal materials for preparing the catalyst support in microchannel reactors. However, the structure of ceramic materials is hard and brittle, and the feature size of microchannel is generally not more than 1 mm, which is difficult to process using traditional processing methods. Diamond wire saw processing technology is mainly used in the slicing of hard and brittle materials such as sapphire and silicon. In this paper, a microchannel with a periodic corrugated microstructure was fabricated on a ceramic plate using diamond wire sawing, and then as a catalyst support when used in a microreactor for MSR hydrogen production. The effects of wire speed and feed speed on the amplitude and period size of the periodic corrugated microstructure were studied using a single-factor experiment. The microchannel surface morphology was observed via SEM and a 3D confocal laser microscope under different processing parameters. The microchannel samples obtained under different processing parameters were supported by a multiple impregnation method. The loading strength of the catalyst was tested via a strong wind purge experiment. The experimental results show that the periodic corrugated microstructure can significantly enhance the load strength of the catalyst. The microchannel catalyst support with the periodic corrugated microstructure was put into the microreactor for a hydrogen production experiment, and a good hydrogen production effect was obtained. The experimental results have a positive guiding effect on promoting ceramic materials as the microchannel catalyst support for the development of hydrogen energy.},

ABSTRACT = {Nacre-inspired metal matrix composites have received much attention due to their excellent deformation coordination ability, which can achieve the synergy of strength and ductility. The preparation of nacre-like Al matrix composites by freeze casting has been a promising application, but the continuous ceramic-rich layer affects the corrosion resistance of the composites, facing complex corrosion problems during service. In this work, the microstructure and corrosion behavior of the nacre-inspired (TiBw-TiB2)/Al composites fabricated by freeze casting and squeeze casting were systematically studied. The results indicated that the Al layers and ceramic-rich layers had little change, about 35 μm and 31 μm, respectively, with an increasing ratio of the Ti/TiB2. Meanwhile, a high Ti/TiB2 ratio resulted in an increase in the Fe-Ti intermetallic phases, which was detrimental to the corrosion performance of the composites and was prone to pitting. The electrochemical test results showed that the 3Ti7TiB2 composite had the lowest corrosion current density (15.9 μA) and intergranular corrosion depth (231 μm), indicating that it had the best corrosion resistance, which can be attributable to its stable and dense passivation film. Two different corrosion phenomena during the intergranular corrosion test existed in the present nacre-inspired (TiBw-TiB2)/Al composites: intergranular corrosion in the Al matrix layer and pitting corrosion in the ceramic-rich layer. Among all the composites, the corrosion depth of the 3Ti7TiB2 composite was the smallest and significantly less than that of the 2024Al alloy. In addition, the continuous ceramic-rich layer acted as a corrosion channel during corrosion, significantly degrading the corrosion resistance of the nacre-like Al composites.},

ABSTRACT = {A special technique has been developed for producing a composite aerogel which consists of graphene oxide and soy wax (GO/wax). The reduction of graphene oxide was carried out by the stepwise heating of this aerogel to 250 °C. The aerogel obtained in the process of the stepwise thermal treatment of rGO/wax was studied by IR and Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and thermogravimetry. The heat treatment led to an increase in the wax fraction accompanied by an increase in the contact angle of the rGO/wax aerogel surface from 136.2 °C to 142.4 °C. The SEM analysis has shown that the spatial structure of the aerogel was formed by sheets of graphene oxide, while the wax formed rather large (200–1000 nm) clumps in the folds of graphene oxide sheets and small (several nm) deposits on the flat surface of the sheets. The sorption properties of the rGO/wax aerogel were studied with respect to eight solvent, oil, and petroleum products, and it was found that dichlorobenzene (85.8 g/g) and hexane (41.9 g/g) had the maximum and minimum sorption capacities, respectively. In the case of oil and petroleum products, the indicators were in the range of 52–63 g/g. The rGO/wax aerogel was found to be highly resistant to sorption–desorption cycles. The cyclic tests also revealed a swelling effect that occurred differently for different parts of the aerogel.},

ABSTRACT = {Epoxy-modified asphalt binder has been widely used in steel deck pavement due to its excellent properties and it is a potential candidate for long life pavements. However, its short reserve time limits its widespread application in pavement engineering. Therefore, this work developed a novel epoxy-modified asphalt binder composed of a laboratory-made curing agent as a solution. Firstly, optimization of preparation temperature of this new material was studied to balance the requirements of enough construction time and the material strength and elongation. The epoxy-modified asphalt binder, prepared at the optimal temperature of 140 °C, had a reserve time exceeding 120 min, whereas the tensile strength and the elongation at failure were 2.22 MPa and 216%, respectively, which satisfied the standard requirements of paving epoxy material well. Secondly, the asphalt mixture property tests demonstrate excellent high-temperature rutting resistance, water stability and low-temperature anti-cracking ability. Additionally, the compatibility and colloidal stability of this epoxy-modified asphalt binder were analyzed in terms of microphase structure. The uniform microphase distribution of this binder showed by the laser confocal microscope observation in both short-term aging case and long-term aging case, indicates the great compatibility between asphalt and epoxy resin during paving process and service life. Furthermore, fatigue tests were conducted to evaluate the long-term durability. The fatigue life of epoxy-modified asphalt mixtures increased by 435%, 427%, 342%, and 276% under the stress ratios of 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, and 0.6, respectively, compared to those of SBS-modified asphalt mixtures. All these results indicate that the new epoxy-modified asphalt material is promising for applications in pavement engineering, especially suitable for long-life road pavement.},

ABSTRACT = {This work investigated the impact and piercing load resistance (energy absorption capabilities) of 3D-printed composites plates manufactured by means of the Fused-Filament-Fabrication (FFF) technique. Two sets of reinforced composite plates were produced. The first set of plates was printed with short-carbon-fiber-reinforced polyamide-12, while the second set was reinforced with continuous fibers. The plates were tested with quasi-static indentation tests at various Span-to-Punch ratios and with three different indenter nose shapes (blunt, hemispherical, and conical). The quasi-static measurements were subsequently elaborated to estimate the energy absorption capability of the plates during a ballistic impact. The addition of continuous fibers increased the quasi-static energy absorption capability by 20–185% with respect to the short-fiber-reinforced plates. The quasi-static results showed that by including the continuous reinforcement in the plates, the normalized energy absorbed increased by an order of magnitude. Finally, a comparison with data from the literature concerning continuous-reinforced composite plates manufactured by means of traditional techniques was carried out. The comparison revealed that FFF-printed composite plates can compete with traditional composite ones in terms of both ballistic and quasi-static penetrating load conditions, even if limited by the lower fiber volume fraction. Thus, these findings confirm that this novel Additive Manufacturing technique is promising and worth investigating further.},

ABSTRACT = {Traditional ACSR overhead wires, which consist of a high-strength steel core and several layers of aluminium wires, are currently the most popular overhead line conductor (OHL) design globally. Operating conditions, particularly operating under varying stresses from Karman vortices, lead to the fatigue cracking of wires of the outer layer, followed by wires of the inner layers. Karman vortices are formed by the detachment of a laminar wind stream flowing around the conductor, which causes vibrations in the conductor called wind or aeolian oscillations. Aluminium wires are manufactured using standard batch material drawing technology. Although the fatigue strength of such wires is not standardised, there are various criteria for evaluating this characteristic, as well as established limits on the number of cycles needed to break the first wires of the outer layer. Fatigue strength also strongly depends on the geometric structure of the wire and its operating conditions. The article analyses the influence of the mechanical condition of aluminium wires used in ACSR cables on their fatigue strength. We then present results from aluminium wire fatigue tests conducted on a specially constructed test rig. In addition, fatigue cracks were interpreted using scanning microscopy.},

ABSTRACT = {The excellent electrical properties of graphene have received widespread attention. However, the difficulty of electron transfer between layers still restricts the application of graphene composite materials to a large extent. Therefore, in this study, graphene/polyimide films were subjected to a Joule heating treatment to improve the electrical conductivity of the film by ~76.85%. After multiple Joule thermal cycle treatments, the conductivity of the graphene/polyimide film still gradually increased, but the increase in amplitude tended to slow down. Finally, after eight Joule heat treatments, the conductivity of the graphene/polyimide film was improved by ~93.94%. The Joule heating treatment caused the polyimide to undergo atomic rearrangement near the interface bonded to the graphene, forming a new crystalline phase favourable for electron transport with graphene as a template. Accordingly, a model of the bilayer capacitive microstructure of graphene/polyimide was proposed. The experiment suggests that the Joule heating treatment can effectively reduce the distance between graphene electrode plates in the bilayer capacitive micro-nanostructures of graphene/polyimide and greatly increases the number of charge carriers on the electrode plates. The TEM and WAXS characterisation results imply atomic structure changes at the graphene/polyimide bonding interface.},

ABSTRACT = {Apart from low-temperature cracking, asphalt pavement may also suffer from thermal fatigue cracking. To clarify the impact of cold waves on the thermal fatigue performance of asphalt mixtures, the typical atmospheric temperature characteristics of different regions in China from 2012 to 2019 were analyzed, and the frequency of cold waves in these regions was determined. The viscoelastic parameters of an asphalt mixture are determined through an indirect tensile relaxation test. The thermal stress of the asphalt mixture is simulated and analyzed by using the finite element method. The effect of cold waves on the thermal fatigue life of the asphalt mixture was evaluated. The results show that the frequency of cold waves is different from region to region in China, and the cold waves mainly occurred from October of one year to February of the next year. Northeast China has the most frequency and the largest temperature drop amplitude, followed by North China. The maximum thermal stress increases with the decrease in temperature drop and initial temperature and is unrelated to the duration of cold waves. The thermal stress calculated based on the atmospheric thermal boundary is higher than the value using the road surface temperature. The thermal fatigue lives of asphalt mixtures in North China and Northeast China are very short, while the thermal fatigue life of the mixture in Central China is the longest. To meet the requirement of thermal fatigue damage caused by cold waves during the designed service stage, the recommended threshold for thermal stress is 0.39–0.77 MPa.},

ABSTRACT = {To investigate the effects of nano-SiO2 (NS) and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) fibers on the durability and mechanical properties of cementitious composites subjected to saline freeze–thaw cycling, a series of PVA fiber-reinforced cementitious composite (PFRCC) specimens were prepared using various fiber contents, and a series of NS and PVA fiber-reinforced cementitious composite (NPFRCC) specimens were prepared using various combinations of NS and fiber contents. Durability and fracture toughness tests were subsequently conducted on the specimens after different numbers of saline freeze–thaw cycles. The results indicate that the degradation of material properties can be divided into slow and accelerated damage stages before/after 50 freeze–thaw cycles. The durability and fracture toughness of the specimen series tended to increase, then decrease with increasing NS and PVA contents, suggesting optimum levels. When the PVA fiber content was 0.5%, PFRCC specimens had the best durability after saline freeze–thaw cycles; when the NS and PVA fiber contents were 1.0% and 0.5%, respectively, NPFRCC specimens had the best durability and fracture properties, and the initiation toughness, destabilization toughness, and fracture energy after 100 saline freeze–thaw cycles were 120.69%, 160.02%, and 451.31%, respectively. The results of this study may guide future exploration of the durability and mechanical properties of concrete subjected to freeze–thaw action.},

ABSTRACT = {Triply periodic minimal surface microarchitectures (TPMS) were developed by mathematicians and evolved in all kingdoms of living organisms. Renowned for their lightweight yet robust attributes, TPMS structures find application in diverse fields, such as the construction of satellites, aircrafts, and electric vehicles. Moreover, these microarchitectures, despite their intricate geometric patterns, demonstrate potential for application as bone substitutes, despite the inherent gothic style of natural bone microarchitecture. Here, we produced three TPMS microarchitectures, D-diamond, G-gyroid, and P-primitive, by 3D printing from hydroxyapatite. We explored their mechanical characterization and, further, implanted them to study their bone augmentation and osteoconduction potential. In terms of strength, the D-diamond and G-gyroid performed significantly better than the P-primitive. In a calvarial defect model and a calvarial bone augmentation model, where osteoconduction is determined as the extent of bony bridging of the defect and bone augmentation as the maximal vertical bone ingrowth, the G-gyroid performed significantly better than the P-primitive. No significant difference in performance was observed between the G-gyroid and D-diamond. Since, in real life, the treatment of bone deficiencies in patients comprises elements of defect bridging and bone augmentation, ceramic scaffolds with D-diamond and G-gyroid microarchitectures appear as the best choice for a TPMS-based scaffold in bone tissue engineering.},

ABSTRACT = {Titanium alloys face challenges of high temperature oxidation during the service period when used as aircraft engine components. In this paper, the effect of Y2O3 addition on the oxidation behavior and the microstructural change of the Ti6Al4V alloy fabricated by selective laser melting (SLM) was comprehensively studied. The results show that the surface of the Ti6Al4V alloy is a dense oxide layer composed of TiO2 and Al2O3 compounds. The thickness of the oxide layer of the Ti6Al4V increased from 59.55 μm to 139.15 μm. In contrast, with the addition of Y2O3, the thickness of the oxide layer increased from 35.73 μm to 80.34 μm. This indicates that the thickness of the oxide layer formation was a diffusion-controlled process and, therefore, the thickness of the oxide layer increased with an increase in temperature. The Ti6Al4V-1.0 wt.% Y2O3 alloy exhibits excellent oxidation resistance, and the thickness is significantly lower than that of the Ti6Al4V alloy. The oxidation kinetics of the Ti6Al4V and Ti6Al4V-1.0 wt.% Y2O3 alloys at 600 °C and 800 °C follows a parabolic rule, whereas the oxidation of the Ti6Al4V and Ti6Al4V-1.0 wt.% Y2O3 alloys at 1000 °C follows the linear law. The average microhardness values of Ti6Al4V samples after oxidation increased to 818.9 ± 20 HV0.5 with increasing temperature, and the average microhardness values of the Ti6Al4V-1.0 wt.% Y2O3 alloy increases until 800 °C and then decreases at 1000 °C. The addition of Y2O3 shows a significant improvement in the microhardness during the different temperatures after oxidation.},
