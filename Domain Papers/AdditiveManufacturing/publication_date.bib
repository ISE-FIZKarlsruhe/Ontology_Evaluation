ABSTRACT = {Material extrusion (ME) using a filament including metal powders has recently attracted considerable attention because it allows the production of metal parts at low cost. However, like other additive manufacturing processes, metal ME suffers from the problem of internal pores. In this study, warm isostatic pressure (WIP)—a post-process used to downsize or remove the pores in polymer ME—was employed in metal ME to improve the mechanical properties of the finished part. It was confirmed experimentally that the tensile strength and the strain at the ultimate tensile strength were increased by WIP. However, from hardness tests, two different results were obtained. On a microscopic scale, there was no change in hardness because the temperature of the WIP process was not high enough to change the microstructure, while on a macroscopic scale, the hardness changed owing to the collapse of the pores within the material under the indenter load. In specimens with relatively large pores, the hardness sensitivity increases with a larger indenter. Finally, factors affecting the WIP process parameters in metal ME were discussed.},

ABSTRACT = {Rapid tooling is a methodology which aims to integrate additive manufacturing into the production of tools to be used in casting, forming or machining processes. In forming, rapid tooling is applied in the production of metallic or plastic tools that guarantee good performance in small- and medium-sized batch production. However, most punches tested to date have dimensions measured in millimeters and are therefore unsuitable for typical real-world industrial processes. In this study, the performance of plastic punches with geometries designed for industrial application was investigated. A deep drawing process involving AISI 304 blanks was created for the manufacturing of cups. Experimental and numerical analyses were conducted to measure the quality of the cups produced and the behaviour of the punches involved. The results indicate that when punch dimensions increase, a more precise cup geometry is produced (99% of drawing depth, 98% of cup precision on the fillet radius, and roundness error equal to 0.53%).},

ABSTRACT = {This paper proposes a gel-formed abrasive tool to address the problem of abrasive agglomeration in a traditional hot-pressing abrasive tool. The effect of Polyimide resin content on the mechanical properties of the gel abrasive tools were tested, and a comparison of the mechanical properties of the gel abrasive tool and the hot-pressing tool was conducted. An orthogonal experiment was conducted to explore the best combination of machining parameters. A polishing experiment of sapphire was conducted to compare the processing effect of the gel abrasive tool and hot-pressing tool. The results from testing the mechanical properties showed that the tensile, flexural, and impact strength of the gel abrasive tool was better than that of the hot-pressing abrasive tool. The results of the orthogonal experiment showed that the best process parameters of the gel abrasive tool were a spindle speed of 900 rpm, a feed rate of 8 μm/min, and a grinding depth of 16 μm. The polishing experiment showed that the gel abrasive tool had a better processing effect on sapphire. The sapphire surface processed by the gel abrasive tool had no deep scratches, and an ultrasmooth surface could be obtained after chemical mechanical polishing (CMP).},

ABSTRACT = {Additive manufacturing technologies have been in continuous growth due to their advantages over traditional manufacturing. The iro3d is a powder deposition machine designed to build metal parts. This research work proposed the adaptation of the iro3d selective powder deposition process to allow the production of glass-ceramic parts using recycled glass powders. Various specimens were produced using different deposition strategies such as build orientation and sintering holding times. Specimens were evaluated in terms of geometric distortions (shrinking and warping) and in terms of mechanical performance (flexural behavior and hardness). Two geometrically complex test parts were also produced to infer the minimum feature size capabilities of the process. The results denoted parts that displayed significant geometrical deviations, which could be correlated with some of the tested parameters. Through the addition of sand to the tested specimens, we demonstrated that distortions could be mitigated with proper control of the powder’s coalescence. In the end, the specimens’ fracture surfaces were examined, and the presence of porosities was correlated with their mechanical properties. The results demonstrated that the iro3d SPD process could be used to produce additively manufactured glass parts.},

ABSTRACT = {Due to the augmented complexity of the factory on the one hand and the increased availability of information on the other hand, nowadays it is possible to design models of production lines able to consider the state of the health of the production system. Such models must combine both the deterministic and the stochastic behaviours of a system, with the former accounting for the mechanics and physics of the industrial process and the latter for randomness, including reliability of the production systems and the unpredictability of the maintenance and of the manufacturing lines. This study proposes the application of a Hybrid Dependability Modelling based on Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the performances of a repairable production line modelled with a queueing G/G/1 system. The model proposed is characterized by random interarrival and service times and by the wearing and dynamic aging phenomena of the machine tools that depend on the working and operating conditions.},

ABSTRACT = {This study considers the problem of numerical modeling of the PEEK product’s 3D printing using the FDM technology. The aim of the study is to verify the adequacy of the use of a thermoviscoelastic model for numerical computations of the PEEK deposition process and to develop an algorithm for calculating this process. The Prony model is used to describe the thermoviscoelastic behavior of the material under study; the temperature-time shift is described by the Williams–Landel–Ferry function (WLF). To obtain the values of the material constants of the relaxation function, first, we used data from other authors; however, after their substitution into the numerical simulation, it was not possible to obtain results close to the full-scale experiment. Therefore, realized our own DMA experiment. The algorithm was developed and implemented in the ANSYS package to calculate non-stationary temperature fields and the stress–strain state of the structure during its layer-by-layer deposition. To solve these problems, the technology of “killing” and subsequent “aliving” of the PEEK material, implemented in the ANSYS package, is used. The numerical algorithm is verified with the results of an experiment on printing samples from PEEK. A good consistency of the calculated data with the experiment is shown.},

ABSTRACT = {To overcome the instability of the traditional magnesium alloy additive process, the research on oscillating laser-arc hybrid additive manufacturing (O-LHAM) for AZ31 Mg alloy was developed first, and it focused on the effect of beam oscillation on process characteristics, such as macroscopic morphology, porosity defects, microstructure, and mechanical properties of thin-walled components. The increasing oscillation frequency was effective in suppressing the defects, including lack of fusion, wavy hump, internal porosity, etc. Compared with the case without oscillation, the average grain size of O-LHAM samples was refined from 22–32 μm to 18–20 μm at 300 Hz, while the percentage of Al8Mn5 and Mg17Al12 precipitation increased from 1.42–1.61% to 2.55–3.32%. For this reason, a stirring laminar flow was induced using the oscillating laser in the melt pool, with the ability to disrupt the grain structure and provide more nucleation sites, which is beneficial in reducing the average grain size and promoting the precipitation of the precipitated phase. Meanwhile, for the component without pores, the ultimate tensile strength is 205 MPa, slightly less than the base, but the elongation is 20.7%, twice that of the base. The tensile fracture is characterized by a large number of dimples and some ductile tearing ridges, demonstrating good ductility, which is associated with the grain refinement and precipitation strengthening induced using the oscillating laser. The results indicated that O-LHAM would be an effective method for manufacturing Mg alloy fast and well.},

ABSTRACT = {Three-dimensional-printed medical devices are a separate group of medical devices necessary for the development of personalized medicine. The present article discusses a modern and specific group of medical devices and exoskeletons, which aims to present our own experiences in the selection of materials, design, artificial-intelligence optimization, production, and testing of several generations of various upper limb exoskeletons when considering the Medical Devices Regulation (MDR) and the ISO 13485 and ISO 10993 standards. Work is underway to maintain the methodological rigor inherent in medical devices and to develop new business models to achieve cost-effectiveness so that inadequate legislation does not stop the development of this group of technologies (3D scanning, 3D printing, and reverse engineering) in the healthcare system. The gap between research and engineering practice and clinical 3D printing should be bridged as quickly and as carefully as possible. This measure will ensure the transfer of proven solutions into clinical practice. The growing maturity of 3D printing technology will increasingly impact everyday clinical practice, so it is necessary to prepare medical specialists and strategic and organizational changes to realize the correct implementation based on the needs of patients and clinicians.},

Several versions of egg-shaped habitat structures characterized by different sizes are presented. Possible locations of habitats both on lunar surface and in craters were discussed. Advantages and disadvantages of particular locations were also pointed out. The proposed in the paper concept of an egg-shaped structure is characterised by a spatial character based on Voronoi diagram and would be implemented using a 3D-printed method. The presented 3D-printed structure was designed to be light and suitable to be covered by lunar soil. As a necessity in the developed concept, in situ resources utilization was addressed in order to generate products using local sources to reduce the number of materials that would be required to be transported from Earth. At the end of the paper, future areas of research and tests are highlighted.},

ABSTRACT = {Additive manufacturing (AM) of polyetheretherketone (PEEK) biomaterials using the material-extrusion (MEX) method has been studied for years. Because of the challenging manufacturing process, precisely controlling printing parameters is crucial. This study aimed to investigate the effects of printing parameters such as orientation and position of printing on mechanical properties. Thus, 34 samples were printed using PEEK filament and the MEX process. Samples were divided into two main groups (A,B) according to their printing orientations (A: groups 1–3) and positions on the build plate (B: groups 4–8). Mechanical tensile tests were performed to evaluate the effects of different printing orientations and positions on mechanical properties. The means of the tensile modulus in samples 3D-printed in XY (group 1), XZ (group 2), and ZX (group 3) orientations were not significantly different (p-value = 0.063). Groups 1 and 2 had smaller distributions than group 3 in the means of tensile strength. The t-test showed that the overall means of the measurements in groups 4–8 did not differ significantly (p-value = 0.315). The tensile tests indicated that printing in vertical and horizontal orientations had no significant influence on mechanical properties. There were no significant differences in mechanical strength between top/bottom printed samples in five different lateral positions. Reliability of printing with good mechanical properties could be a step forward to manufacturing patient-specific implants.},

ABSTRACT = {Magnesium alloys are perspective materials for use in transportation, aerospace and medical industries, mainly because of their good load-to-weight ratio, biocompatibility and biodegradability. For the effective production of magnesium components by the laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) process, the process parameters with verified mechanical properties need to be determined. In this paper, we prepared bulk samples with a high relative density of AZ91D magnesium alloy. Tensile tests were then performed on LPBF samples to evaluate the mechanical properties. Our results show that the bulk samples achieved a relative density >99%, in multiple planes over the full sample height, while the mechanical properties reached values of YS = 181 MPa, UTS = 305 MPa and A5.65 = 5.2%. The analysis by scanning electron microscope revealed fine β-Mg17Al12 particles in the microstructure, which have a positive effect on the mechanical properties. The chemical composition of magnesium alloy AZ91D changed slightly during processing by LPBF due to the evaporation of the Mg content. However, the resulting composition still corresponds to the range specified by the ASTM standard for the AZ91D alloy.},

ABSTRACT = {Nowadays, the use of 3D printing is becoming a key process for on-demand and customized manufacturing. One of the most flexible 3D printing techniques is fused deposition modeling (FDM), where the combination of multiple materials was recently introduced. A quantum leap in part design is possible by integrating local variations between materials that allow for expanded functionality to be built into a single part. Therefore, the process of co-extrusion and material mixing is becoming more and more popular. The process of management and design of the engineered part are still complicated, and there are no commercially available tools that follow the process from design to production of these highly engineered products. This paper proposes a methodology to fill this gap and allow any designer to be able to produce multi-material parts by editing a G-code (computer numerical control programming language) with engineered gradients for FDM technology. More specifically, the proposed approach is based on the modification of the G-code according to a volumetric model describing the local combination of two or more materials. This original aspect allows for a wide extension of the current software capabilities. To explain and test the method, a simple test case was investigated, in which two components of an earphone are consolidated and developed gradually by combining polylactic acid and thermoplastic polyurethane. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach within the limits of the material coextrusion additive manufacturing process.},

ABSTRACT = {Recent advances in electrical machines and energy storage technologies make electric vehicles (EVs) feasible replacements to conventional internal combustion engines. One of the main challenges of high speed electrical machines is providing maximum output power with minimum energy losses, weight, and volume. At high frequency operation, the conductors of AC electrical machines can suffer from skin and proximity effects. This results in high AC losses in the machine windings and can eventually lead to machine failure. In this paper, a novel design for a semi-stranded coil is proposed to limit these undesirable effects. Enabled by additive manufacturing (AM) technology, this sophisticated design is 3D printed using ultralight aluminum alloy. Finally, the AC performance of this coil is measured and compared with conventional single-strand copper coil at different frequency levels. It is found that the proposed design can effectively limit the eddy current losses in the high frequency domain.},

ABSTRACT = {(1) Background: Synovial tissue plays a fundamental role in inflammatory processes. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms regulating healthy and diseased synovium functions, as in rheumatic diseases, is crucial to discovering more effective therapies to minimize or prevent pathological progress. The present study aimed at developing a bioartificial synovial tissue as an in vitro model for drug screening or personalized medicine applications using 3D bioprinting technology. (2) Methods: The volumetric extrusion technique has been used to fabricate cell-laden scaffolds. Gelatin Methacryloyl (GelMA), widely applied in regenerative medicine and tissue engineering, was selected as a bioink and combined with an immortalized cell line of fibroblast-like synoviocytes (K4IM). (3) Results: Three different GelMA formulations, 7.5–10–12.5% w/v, were tested for the fabrication of the scaffold with the desired morphology and internal architecture. GelMA 10% w/v was chosen and combined with K4IM cells to fabricate scaffolds that showed high cell viability and negligible cytotoxicity for up to 14 days tested by Live & Dead and lactate dehydrogenase assays. (4) Conclusions: We successfully 3D bioprinted synoviocytes-laden scaffolds as a proof-of-concept (PoC) towards the fabrication of a 3D synovial membrane model suitable for in vitro studies. However, further research is needed to reproduce the complexity of the synovial microenvironment to better mimic the physiological condition.},

ABSTRACT = {Industrial engineering applications often require manufacturing large components in composite materials to obtain light structures; however, moulds are expensive, especially when manufacturing a limited batch of parts. On the one hand, when traditional approaches are carried out, moulds are milled from large slabs or laminated with composite materials on a model of the part to produce. In this case, the realisation of a mould leads to adding time-consuming operations to the manufacturing process. On the other hand, if a fully additively manufactured approach is chosen, the manufacturing time increases exponentially and does not match the market’s requirements. This research proposes a methodology to improve the production efficiency of large moulds using a hybrid technology by combining additive manufacturing and milling tools. A block of soft material such as foam is milled, and then the printing head of an additive manufacturing machine deposits several layers of plastic material or modelling clay using conformal three-dimensional paths. Finally, the mill can polish the surface, thus obtaining a mould of large dimensions quickly, with reduced cost and without needing trained personnel and handcraft polishing. A software tool has been developed to modify the G-code read by an additive manufacturing machine to obtain material deposition over the soft mould. The authors forced conventional machining instructions to match those of an AM machine. Thus, additive deposition of new material uses 3D conformal trajectories typical of CNC machines. Consequently, communication between two very different instruments using the same language is possible. At first, the code was tested on a modified Fused Filament Fabrication machine whose firmware has been adapted to manage a milling tool and a printing head. Then, the software was tested on a large machine suitable for producing moulds for the large parts typical of marine and aerospace engineering. The research demonstrates that AM technologies can integrate conventional machinery to support the composite materials industry when large parts are required.},

ABSTRACT = {While attracting increasing research attention in science and technology, Machine Learning (ML) is playing a critical role in the digitalization of manufacturing operations towards Industry 4.0. Recently, ML has been applied in several fields of production engineering to solve a variety of tasks with different levels of complexity and performance. However, in spite of the enormous number of ML use cases, there is no guidance or standard for developing ML solutions from ideation to deployment. This paper aims to address this problem by proposing an ML application roadmap for the manufacturing industry based on the state-of-the-art published research on the topic. First, this paper presents two dimensions for formulating ML tasks, namely, ’Four-Know’ (Know-what, Know-why, Know-when, Know-how) and ’Four-Level’ (Product, Process, Machine, System). These are used to analyze ML development trends in manufacturing. Then, the paper provides an implementation pipeline starting from the very early stages of ML solution development and summarizes the available ML methods, including supervised learning methods, semi-supervised methods, unsupervised methods, and reinforcement methods, along with their typical applications. Finally, the paper discusses the current challenges during ML applications and provides an outline of possible directions for future developments.},

ABSTRACT = {Smart surfaces are becoming more and more popular in the field of intralogistics, as they combine great flexibility with easy reprogrammability. Pursuing this trend, the following article proposes a modular surface to perform handling tasks, such as sorting, stopping, or slowing down material flows. Differently from the current technology, the surface used is under-actuated, thus, it exploits the speed, already possessed by the object, or the gravity to perform, with a simplified hardware, for the aforementioned tasks. In practice, these handling actions are completed using an array of rotors, of which only the direction of the rotation axis is controlled. Moreover, the axis can only assume certain discrete orientations in the plane, further simplifying the design. Thus, what is created is a controllable and under-actuated friction field, which, in contrast with similar existing systems, does not require active driving forces to manipulate the material flow. In the article, the analytic model of the surface is described, and a software simulation environment is introduced to demonstrate its functioning. In addition, examples of sorting, slowing down, and stopping operations and a validation of the simulation itself are presented.},

ABSTRACT = {Robotic bin-picking performance has been gaining attention in recent years with the development of increasingly advanced camera and machine vision systems, collaborative and industrial robots, and sophisticated robotic grippers. In the random bin-picking process, the wide variety of objects in terms of shape, weight, and surface require complex solutions for the objects to be reliably picked. The challenging part of robotic bin-picking is to determine object pick-points correctly. This paper presents a simulation model based on ADAMS/MATLAB cosimulation for robotic pick-point evaluation for a 2-F robotic gripper. It consists of a mechanical model constructed in ADAMS/View, MATLAB/Simulink force controller, several support functions, and the graphical user interface developed in MATLAB/App Designer. Its functionality can serve three different applications, such as: (1) determining the optimal pick-points of the object due to object complexity, (2) selecting the most appropriate robotic gripper, and (3) improving the existing configuration of the robotic gripper (finger width, depth, shape, stroke width, etc.). Additionally, based on this analysis, new variants of robotic grippers can be proposed. The simulation model has been verified on a selected object on a sample 2-F parallel robotic gripper, showing promising results, where up to 75% of pick-points were correctly determined in the initial testing phase.},

ABSTRACT = {Injection molding is one of the most important processes for the mass production of plastic parts. In recent years, many researchers have focused on predicting the occurrence and intensity of defects in injected molded parts, as well as the optimization of process parameters to avoid such defects. One of the most frequent defects of manufactured parts is blush, which usually occurs around the gate location. In this study, to identify the effective parameters on blush formation, eight design parameters with effect probability on the influence of this defect have been investigated. Using a combination of design of experiments (DOE), finite element analysis (FEA), and ANOVA, the most significant parameters have been identified (runner diameter, holding pressure, flow rate, and melt temperature). Furthermore, to provide an efficient predictive model, machine learning methods such as basic artificial neural networks, their combination with genetic algorithms, and particle swarm optimization have been applied and their performance analyzed. It was found that the basic artificial neural network (ANN), with an average accuracy error of 1.3%, provides the closest predictions to the FEA results. Additionally, the process parameters were optimized using ANOVA and a genetic algorithm, which resulted in a significant reduction in the blush defect area.},

ABSTRACT = {Aligned with the Sustainability Development Goals (SDGs), we present the complete methodology of preparing bio-based polymer filaments to be used in additive manufacturing, specifically by means of so-called Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) in 3D printing. Filament production and 3D printing were both developed and optimised in this work. First, we focused on the steps of producing and optimising the extrusion process of unreinforced polylactic acid (PLA) composite filaments. Second, we studied the resulting material properties by discussing the selection of a specimen geometry and the international standards adequate for FFF 3D printing. Moreover, we investigated the process parameters in order to achieve reliable structures. Based on the reinforcement material (stereocomplex fibres (Sc-PLA fibre) and bi-component fibres (bi-co PLA fibre), base-matrices were selected for producing un-reinforced filaments. In this way, we present the complete preparation approach by identifying problems and pitfalls for fostering studies of bio-based polymer filaments.},

ABSTRACT = {Hybrid wire arc additive-milling subtractive manufacturing (HWMM) is an effective way to improve the quality of complex metal components, but the difference in the properties of the aluminum alloy and magnesium alloy fabricated by HWMM has been not addressed. In the paper, the differences in deposition accuracy and tensile anisotropy between the Al5Si Al and AZ31B Mg alloys were studied by using the HWMM method. Under the optimal parameters, the minimum surface roughness of the AZ31B sample was 146.1 μm, which was 90% higher than for the Al5Si sample. The differences in the tensile strength and elongation of the AZ31B sample were 32% and 56%, respectively, being 6 and 3.3 times higher than those of the Al5Si samples. According to the fracture behavior of the samples, the tensile anisotropy of both alloys was mainly attributed to defects such as incomplete fusion and porosity in the fusion line. However, there was obvious structural inhomogeneity in AZ31B samples, where the grain size difference between adjacent areas reached 40%. This led to the easier fracture of AZ31B samples. These results contribute to our understanding of the HWMM of light alloys.},

ABSTRACT = {Warping and dross formation are the main defects of an overhang structure formed by laser powder bed fusion. In order to study these defects, a seven−shaped overhang structure with different lengths and heights of the overhang was printed. The influence of the temperature and stress field on the overhang structure was investigated using a 3D finite element (FE) model. The results of the simulation showed that the molten pool in the powder support zone was much larger than the molten pool in the solid support zone. The molten pool sank due to the actions of gravity and the capillary force. This led to the powder melting, which then formed a droplet−like dross formation on the lower surface. The temperature difference between the regions led to a large residual stress. When the residual stress exceeded the material strength, warping deformation occurred in the top area, affecting the subsequent powder−laying process. The warping zone was remelted when the next layer was processed. As the number of forming layers increased, the thermal conductivity and stiffness increased continuously, and the deformation of the top area gradually decreased. The experiment results showed that the longer the overhanging length was, the more serious the warpage was. When the overhanging length was below 3 mm, the warping of the top area continued to decrease to zero as the building process proceeded. Meanwhile, the dross formation appeared at the bottom of the overhanging area in all experimental groups. Studying the process of warping and dross formation was helpful to understand the defect change process in the manufacturing process of an overhang structure.},

ABSTRACT = {The present study investigated the effect of heat treatment (pre- and post-weld) on the microstructure and mechanical properties of an SS304L/IN718 dissimilar rotary friction welded alloy. Optical and scanning electron micrographs of the dissimilar rotary friction welded SS304L/IN718 joints in solution-treated (ST), solution-treated and aged (STA), and post-weld heat treatment (PWHT) conditions revealed defect-free welds. Furthermore, various zones were observed across the weld region, namely the fully deformed zone (FDZ), thermomechanical affected zone (TMAZ), heat affected zone (HAZ), and base material (BM). Among the SS304L/IN718 dissimilar friction welds with different heat treatment conditions (prior ST and STA, PWHT), the PWHTed dissimilar welds exhibited excellent mechanical properties, which could be attributed to the formation of the strengthening precipitates γ′ and γ″ during double aging in PWHT. In contrast, the mechanical properties were found to be the poorest in the STA condition, possibly due to the dissolution of the strengthening precipitates γ′ and γ″ during friction welding. It was observed that the SS304L/IN718 dissimilar friction welds in the ST and STA conditions failed in the HAZ of the SS304L side, away from the weld interface, indicating that the weld region was stronger than the weakest base metal (SS304L) in the various joints.},

ABSTRACT = {Fused filament fabrication (FFF) technology is highly favored by various industries as the simplest and most commonly used technology in additive manufacturing. The embedding of continuous fiber-reinforced thermoplastic composites (CFRTC) is a great help to compensate for the mechanical properties of FFF-printed specimens. In this paper, the optimal printing parameters of printed specimens containing continuous carbon fiber-reinforced PLA were investigated by the Taguchi method, full factorial analysis, and the tensile test. Fiber printing layer thickness and fiber printing speed are significant factors. After excluding the influence of fiber overlap, the optimal printing parameters were obtained. When the thickness of the fiber printing layer is 0.05 mm, the speed of the fiber printing nozzle is 250 mm/min, and the temperature of the fiber printing nozzle is 210 °C, the maximum tensile stress of the sample is 189.52 MPa. In this paper, the maximum tensile stress of the specimen printed by different printing parameters can be doubled, which shows the influence of printing parameters on the mechanical properties of the specimen. Compared with the specimen using pure PLA printing, the increase was 703.5%. Then the failure mechanism of 3D-printed CFRTC specimens with different layer thicknesses was investigated by using microstructural morphology and tensile fracture interfacial property analysis. The influence of layer thickness parameters on the interfacial bonding force was revealed. Through analysis, it is found that the lower the thickness of the specimen printing layer, the better the interface bonding force of the specimen, and the minimum layer thickness suitable for FFF independent extrusion printer is found.},

ABSTRACT = {Additive manufacturing (AM) is often used for prototyping; however, in recent years, there have been several final product applications, namely the development of polymer-metal hybrid (PMH) components that have emerged. In this paper, the objective is to characterize the adhesion of single-lap joints between two different materials: aluminium and a polymer-based material manufactured by fused filament fabrication (FFF). Single-lap joints were fabricated using an aluminium substrate with different surface treatments: sandpaper polishing (SP) and grit blasting (GB). Three filaments for FFF were tested: acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), polyamide (PA), and polyamide reinforced with short carbon fibers (PA + CF). To characterize the behaviour of these single-lap joints, mechanical tension loading tests were performed. The analysis of the fractured surface of the joints aimed to correlate the adhesion performance of each joint with the occurred failure mode. The obtained results show the impact of surface roughness (0.16 < Ra < 1.65 µm) on the mechanical properties of the PMH joint. The ultimate lap shear strength (ULSS) of PMH single-lap joints produced by FFF (1 < ULSS < 6.6 MPa) agree with the reported values in the literature and increases for substrates with a higher surface roughness, remelting of the primer (PA and PA + CF), and higher stiffness of the polymer-based adherent.},

ABSTRACT = {The facility layout problem is one of the fundamental production system management problems. It has a significant impact on overall system efficiency. This paper introduces a new facility layout problem that allows for choosing from multiple variants of each facility. The need for choosing the most suitable selection from the facility variants while at the same time optimizing other layout quality indicators represents a new optimization challenge. We build on our previous work where single- and multi-objective evolutionary algorithms using indirect representation were proposed to solve the facility layout problem. Here, the evolutionary algorithms are adapted for the problem of facility variants, including the new solution representation and variation operators. Additionally, a cooling schedule, whose role is to control the exploration/exploitation ratio during the course of the optimization process, is proposed. It was inspired by the cooling schedule used in the simulated annealing technique. The extended evolutionary algorithms have been experimentally evaluated on two data sets, with and without the alternative variants of facilities. The obtained results demonstrate the capability of the extended evolutionary algorithms to solve the newly formulated facility layout problem efficiently. It also shows that the cooling schedule improves the convergence of the algorithms.},

ABSTRACT = {Laser metal deposition with coaxial wire feeding is a directed energy deposition process in which a metal wire is fed to a laser-induced melt pool. Oxidation occurring during the process is a major challenge as it significantly influences the mechanical properties of the produced part. Therefore, an inert gas atmosphere is required in the high temperature process zone, whereby local shielding offers significant cost advantages over an inert gas chamber. In this work, a novel local shielding gas nozzle was developed based on basic methods of fluid mechanics. A gas flow-optimized prototype incorporating internal cooling channels was additively manufactured by laser-powder bed fusion and tested for its effectiveness via deposition experiments. Using the developed local shielding gas concept, an unwanted mixing with the atmosphere due to turbulence was avoided and an oxide-free deposition was achieved when processing a stainless steel ER316LSi wire. Furthermore, the effects of the shielding gas flow rate were investigated, where a negative correlation with the melt pool temperature as well as the weld bead width was demonstrated. Finally, a solid cuboid was successfully built up without oxide inclusions. Overheating of the nozzle due to reflected laser radiation could be avoided by the internal cooling system. The concept, which can be applied to most commercially available coaxial wire deposition heads, represents an important step for the economical application of laser metal deposition.},

ABSTRACT = {Laser metal deposition (LMD) is an additive manufacturing (AM) process capable of producing large components for the aerospace and oil and gas industries. This is achieved by mounting the deposition head on a motion system, such as an articulated robot or a gantry computer numerical control (CNC) machine, which can scan large volumes. Articulated robots are more flexible and less expensive than CNC machines, which on the other hand, are more accurate. This study compares two LMD systems with different motion architectures (i.e., an eight-axis articulated robot and a five-axis CNC gantry machine) in producing a large gas turbine axisymmetric component. The same process parameters were applied to both machines. The deposited components show no significant differences in geometry, indicating that the different performances in terms of accuracy of the two machines do not influence the outcome. The findings indicate that LMD can consistently produce large-scale axisymmetric metal components with both types of equipment. For such an application, the user has the option of using an articulated robot when flexibility and cost are essential, such as in a research context, or a CNC machine where ease of programming and process standardization are important elements, such as in an industrial environment.},

ABSTRACT = {This work explores the use of additive manufacturing (AM) to reprocess recycled glass and carbon fibers in the automotive sector. It aims to foster exploitation of recycled Glass Fiber Reinforced Polymers (rGFRPs) and recycled Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymers (rCFRPs) through two manufacturing workflows: indirect Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) and UV-assisted Direct Ink Writing (UV-DIW). An industrial case study on vehicle components has been considered by prototyping one real component. After the tensile tests, some molds were fabricated with a FFF 3D printer for the indirect 3D printing process to cast an epoxy-based thermosetting resin with rGFs and rCFs. The second technology consisted in fabricating the parts by hardening in-situ a photo- and thermal-curable thermosetting acrylic liquid resin with rGFs. These results validate the use of AM and recycled composites for applications in the automotive sector. These approaches may be implemented for customizable components for batches below 100 vehicles as the first step for their exploitation.},

ABSTRACT = {Metal additive manufacturing, particularly laser powder bed fusion, is increasingly used in the gas turbine industry for the fabrication of channels with small diameters for conformal cooling and flow passage applications. A critical challenge in this context lies in evaluating aspects such as the geometrical and hydraulic diameters, the effective area and the roughness on the internal surface of the channel that affects the flow functionality. This paper proposes a new method to evaluate the geometrical and functional equivalent diameters, i.e., the hydraulic diameter of cylindrical channels and the mean surface topography height on the internal channel surface, using X-ray computed tomography. The developed methods were validated with experimental flow tests, considering the mean surface topography height to be equivalent to the hydrodynamic sand grain roughness, thereby determining the hydraulic diameter and the associated effective area. The method is a much faster approach to determining the available hydraulic diameter compared to flow tests and offers the possibility of evaluating the internal surface characteristics, with discrepancies between the two approaches being less than ±3%.},

ABSTRACT = {Colored contact lenses have gained popularity in recent years. However, their production process is plagued by low efficiency, which is attributed to the complex nature of the lens color patterns. The manufacturing process involves multiple complex steps that can introduce defects or inconsistencies into the contact lenses. Moreover, manual inspection of a considerable number of contact lenses that are produced inefficiently in terms of consistency and quality by humans is prevalent. Alternatively, automatic optical inspection (AOI) systems have been developed to perform quality-control checks on colored contact lenses. However, their accuracy is limited due to the increasing complexity of the lens color patterns. To address these issues, convolutional neural networks have been used to detect and classify defects in colored contact lenses. This study aims to provide a comprehensive guide for AOI systems using artificial intelligence in the colored contact lens manufacturing process, including the benefits and challenges of using these systems. Further, future research directions to achieve a classification accuracy of >95%, which is the human recognition rate, are explored.},

ABSTRACT = {Shock attenuation is a significant aspect of shockproof design. The aim of this study is to explore the use of lattice structures for shock isolation applications. Five lattice structures were fabricated using photopolymer resin and subjected to quasi-static compression tests under a universal testing machine and shock response tests under a pneumatic exciter. The quasi-static compression tests provided preliminary data on the lattice structure’s collapse modes, stress, strain, and energy absorption. The shock test results revealed that the responses from the lattice structures were complex convolutions of the frequency. Moreover, the collapsed mode under the compression experiment did not guarantee the same outcome as in the shock impulse experiment. Amongst the lattice structures, the face-centred cubic with cubic perimeter (FCC + CP) structure exhibited the poorest shock isolation properties, with an ability to absorb only approximately one-third of the shock compared to solid structures. On the other hand, the body-centred cubic with cubic perimeter (BCC + CP) structure showed the highest impulse response with average shock transmissibility, making it a viable option for applications requiring shock insulation. However, it should be noted that this data may only be applicable for high acceleration with low degrees of force, less than 300 N.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper presents one of the final stages in the development of a holistic model of the selective laser melting (SLM) process. The holistic model developed previously allows for modeling of only one stage of SLM, which limits simulations to one cycle with one material. The lattice Boltzmann method is applied for simulation of laser treatment, melting, fluid flow, and solidification. Several models of powder bed generation were developed within the framework of the holistic model and are described in this paper. They were developed on the basis of static and dynamic physical principles with the use of cellular automata, their own code, and the Unity® platform. They employed continuous and discrete particle representation and incorporated a model of powder deposition with particles of atomized or arbitrary shape. The closing of the external simulation circuit, which contains the powder bed generation model, cycle initialization, its realization by the model based on the Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM), and the powder removal model, allows us to finish one simulation cycle of laser treatment and initialize the next, thereby enabling multistage multi-material simulations. The simulation results of the multistage SLM process with the Ti-6Al-V alloy and bioactive glass are presented in this paper. These simulation results confirm the possibility of modeling several SLM stages with two different materials. The holistic model can be used for simulation, design, and optimization of multistage, multi-material SLM processes.},

ABSTRACT = {The rapid development of the additive manufacturing industry is a great opportunity both for the development of the industry in the context of rapid prototyping and for hobbyists using 3D printers at home. At the same time, such a rapid technological development poses a significant challenge for specialists dealing with sources of pollutant emissions to the environment as well as for Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) specialists dealing with the assessment of chemical hazards in the workplace. In this article, the authors demonstrate the legitimacy of the concern regarding issues relating to emissions from the 3D printing process, in particular FFF (fused filament fabrication). We carried out tests on the emission of volatile organic compounds from the printer chamber and compared them with the results of analyses conducted for the same materials in laboratory conditions by heating in a vial. They showed that the spectrometric analysis differed in both cases, which proved a clear influence of the parameters of additive manufacturing on both the amount and type of the emitted substances. The article also presents the sizes and shapes of the solid particles emitted during the process and aggregated during pollutant analyses.},

ABSTRACT = {The industrial demand for functional filaments made of bio-sourced, biocompatible, biodegradable, and/or recyclable polymers and composites for material extrusion (MEX) 3D printing is continuously growing. Polylactic acid (PLA), the most popular filament, combines such properties, yet its reinforcement with low-cost, inert, and/or recycled fillers remains challenging. Herein, glass in three different micro/nano-forms was the reinforcement agent in PLA. Three different experimental tiers were elaborated by producing composite filaments with glass in powder, beads, and flake forms in various loadings to optimize the concentrations. A thermomechanical process, i.e., melt filament extrusion, was exploited. The composites were evaluated for their thermal degradation stability and composition using thermogravimetric analysis and Raman. MEX 3D printing was used to produce tensile, flexural, impact, and microhardness specimens, to quantitatively evaluate their mechanical response. Field emission scanning electron microscopy evaluation and fractography were carried out to depict fracture patterns of the specimens after their tests. All three glass types induced impressive reinforcement effects (up to 60% in flexural loading), especially in the flake form. The impact of the additional process cost through glass fillers implementation was also assessed, indicating that such composites are cost-effective.},

ABSTRACT = {In laser powder bed fusion, process-inherited thermal residual stress is developed due to the thermal strain misfit between each layer. Detailed analysis and a prediction of the residual stress are needed because it can induce distortions of the components and, in some serious cases, stress-induced defects such as cracking. In this work, the effects of heat treatment conditions on residual stress in maraging 18Ni-300 steel, fabricated by laser powder bed fusion, were investigated. Cantilever-shaped specimens were used to experimentally analyze residual stress caused by the distortions of the specimens while cutting them from the supporters. The cantilever samples showed complex distortion behavior in the as-built state. They bent downward while cutting them from the supporter when the thickness was relatively thin, and the bending deformation became upward instead of downward with increasing thickness. Interpreting this behavior by finite element simulation showed that the downward bending was due to the compressive stress state at the top layer of the maraging steel. When the cantilever specimens were aging heat treated, the distortions were significantly reduced, implying that the process-inherited residual stress was diminished.},

ABSTRACT = {Vertical oscillation arc welding for narrow gap gas metal arc welding (NG-GMAW) has a relatively simple structure, and it is widely used in all-position pipeline field welding. However, it has some shortcomings, such as incomplete fusion defects on the sidewall and interlayer. Aiming at resolving these shortcomings, a mathematical model is proposed to obtain appropriate welding parameters in different positions. In this model, the response surface methodology (RSM) based on the central composite design (CCD) was developed to study the interactions between welding parameters and the weld bead geometry. Then the analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to evaluate the accuracy and significance of the proposed model. Finally, experiments were carried out in flat, vertical, and overhead positions to obtain the optimal parameters. The macroscopic metallography of the transversal section of the weld bead under the optimizing welding parameters showed that the weld beads were free of defects in the sidewall and interlayers.},

ABSTRACT = {Binder jetting is a crucial process in additive manufacturing (AM) and is widely used in sand mold casting. This study explores the challenges of simulating binder droplets in ANSYS Fluent, including complexity and computational time. To overcome these challenges, we propose a geometric approach that models the binder droplet as a circular shape instead of an actual droplet. Additionally, the dynamic mesh feature is employed to transform the initial boundary condition into a wall condition at a specified time interval (Δt). This simplified approach eliminates the need to simulate actual droplets, leading to significant computational resource and time savings. By adopting this geometric approach, we can accurately predict the diffusion and penetration behavior of binder droplets with varying materials and volumes in porous media with different porosities. Through data analysis, it was found that the main variables affecting the diffusion diameter and penetration depth are binder volume and porosity. The successful implementation of this simplified model enables researchers and engineers to expedite the simulation of binder behavior, facilitating process optimization and enhancing the understanding of binder jetting technology in the field of additive manufacturing.},

ABSTRACT = {The osseointegration in/around additively manufactured (AM) lattice structures of a new titanium alloy, Ti–19Nb–14Zr, was evaluated. Different lattices with increasingly high sidewalls gradually closing them were manufactured and implanted in sheep. After removal, the bone–interface implant (BII) and bone–implant contact (BIC) were studied from 3D X-ray computed tomography images. Measured BII of less than 10 µm and BIC of 95% are evidence of excellent osseointegration. Since AM naturally leads to a high-roughness surface finish, the wettability of the implant is increased. The new alloy possesses an increased affinity to the bone. The lattice provides crevices in which the biological tissue can jump in and cling. The combination of these factors is pushing ossification beyond its natural limits. Therefore, the quality and speed of the ossification and osseointegration in/around these Ti–19Nb–14Zr laterally closed lattice implants open the possibility of bone spline key of prostheses. This enables the stabilization of the implant into the bone while keeping the possibility of punctual hooks allowing the implant to be removed more easily if required. Thus, this new titanium alloy and such laterally closed lattice structures are appropriate candidates to be implemented in a new generation of implants.},

ABSTRACT = {Femtosecond laser processing technology offers a promising technique for the preparation of micro and nanostructures of single-crystal silicon carbide (SiC), thanks to its high precision and non-destructive processing. However, further research is needed to optimize processing parameters, as well as improve efficiency and quality of the process. This study conducts experiments to explore the effects of femtosecond laser ablation on single-crystal SiC. The influence and significance of parameters, such as fluence (F), repetition rate, scan speed (S), multipass scanning (c) and numerical aperture on the performance of grooves, including groove depth, groove width, heat-affected zone (HAZ) width, material removal rate (MRR) and side wall inclination angle, were studied. The results show that the influence of fluence and numerical aperture on groove depth, groove width, HAZ width, MRR and side wall inclination angle is very significant. The scan speed has a very significant effect on the groove depth, groove width, HAZ width and side wall inclination angle but has insignificant effect on the MRR. Repetition rate and multipass scanning have a very significant effect on groove depth, HAZ width, MRR and side wall inclination angle and a moderately significant effect on groove width. The experimental methods of increasing the aspect ratio and reducing the HAZ width were studied, and a significance analysis was carried out. Fluence, multipass scanning and z-layer feed have significant effects on groove depth, groove width, aspect ratio, HAZ width and MRR. The influence of polarization angle on groove depth, groove width, aspect ratio and MRR is insignificant.},

ABSTRACT = {This work proposes the design of a low-cost sensory glove system that complements the operation of a 3D-printed mechanical hand prosthesis, providing it with the ability to detect touch, locate it and even measure the intensity of associated forces. Firstly, the production of the prosthetic model was performed using 3D printing, which allowed for quick and cheap production of a robotic hand with the implementation of a mechanical system that allows controlled movements with high performance and with the possibility of easily replacing each piece individually. Secondly, we performed the construction and instrumentation of a complementary sensory mimicry add-on system, focusing on the ability to sense touch as the primary target. Using piezoresistive sensors attached to the palm of the glove, a multi-sensor system was developed that was able to locate and quantify forces exerted on the glove. This system showed promising results and could be used as a springboard to develop a more complex and multifunctional system in the future.},

ABSTRACT = {Various types of heat pipes are available to purchase off the shelf, from various manufacturers, but most of them have strictly defined geometry and technical parameters. However, when there is a need to use a heat pipe (HP) with an unusual size and shape or working conditions other than the standard ones, it becomes very costly to order them from manufacturers, especially in small quantities, and only a few producers are willing to fulfill such an order. This paper presents a detailed description and step-by-step method of manufacturing and testing a low-cost HP with specific properties and geometry, cooperating with a modular heat recovery system based on the use of phase change materials (PCM) for electromobility applications. The presented heat pipes were made entirely by hand, primarily with the use of basic workshop tools, without the use of specialized and automated CNC machines. Utensils used during the process were either made by hand or using desktop FDM 3D printers. During the evaluation of heat pipes’ performance within PCM (coconut oil), simple statistical functions were used. One-dimensional and two-dimensional histograms were used to visualize data obtained during this research. The presented method allows the manufacturing of heat pipes that are, on average, able to melt about 35% more PCM than an empty copper pipe with the exact same geometry. The HPs’ performance in coconut oil was evaluated on the basis of their future applications.},

ABSTRACT = {Workload balance is significant in the manufacturing industry. However, on the one hand, some existing specific criteria cannot achieve the minimization workload imbalance of parallel machines. On the other hand, there are few algorithms in existing studies that can effectively solve the parallel machine scheduling problem with the objective of minimizing workload imbalance. Inspired by this, we investigate an identical parallel machine scheduling problem with the objective of the minimum workload smoothness index. We first establish a mathematical model for the considered problem and then linearize its objective function. We prove the NP-hardness of the problem by reducing the PARTITION problem to it, and we provide both the upper bound and lower bound of the studied problem. An efficient genetic algorithm and an improved list scheduling algorithm are also proposed to efficiently address the considered problem. The numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.},

ABSTRACT = {With the popularization of small batch production, the main cutting method for sheet metal parts has changed. Laser cutting has become the main production method for coil material cutting. Developing an irregular part nesting method for the continuous cutting of coil material is urgent. Based on the coil material cutting process, this paper proposes an intelligent approach for the unit nesting problem of coil material. Firstly, a unit nesting model of coil material was constructed. Secondly, an intelligent approach using an improved marine predator algorithm was used to solve this model. In solving the model, the minimum nesting unit was continuously updated by changing the position, angle, and quantity of the nesting parts. Thirdly, the geometric characteristics of this minimum nesting unit were extracted. Finally, the nesting units for production were obtained using a single row or opposite row of the minimum nesting unit. The computational results and comparison prove that the presented approach is feasible and effective in improving material utilization, reducing production costs, and meeting the requirements of the production site.},

ABSTRACT = {In recent decades, enthusiasts and researchers from all over the world have invested a lot of energy and time in trying to develop linear propulsion systems using the inertial force generated by two masses revolving in opposite directions. The authors present an original concept for the propulsion system of a mobile platform by using the inertial force generated by two eccentric bodies that are revolving in opposite directions. Based on this approach, a wheeled vehicle was designed, built using additive manufacturing techniques, and finally tested. Validation of the concept and verification of the analytically derived kinematic parameters were carried out by 3D modeling and motion simulation performed in SolidWorks 2023. It was concluded that the initial position of the eccentric bodies determines the direction of movement. Moreover, a favorable correlation of the eccentric bodies’ masses with the entire platform mass is able to ensure the movement at an oscillating but permanently positive speed.},

ABSTRACT = {Strengthening mechanisms were examined in a Fe-0.43C-1.60Si-0.01Mn-1.1Cr-0.95Mo-0.08V-0.05Nb steel exhibiting a yield strength (YS) of 1310 MPa after tempering and 1550 MPa after tempforming. The dislocation strengthening gave a major contribution to the overall YS of the steel in the tempered condition, whereas dispersion strengthening was a major contributor to the YS of the steel in the tempformed condition. High values of dislocation strengthening after tempering were attributed to dislocations composing the lath boundaries. A high density of free dislocations provided nearly the same dislocation strengthening after tempforming. Warm rolling after tempering led to alignment of intercrystallite boundaries along the rolling direction that decreased the interparticle spacing between M23C6 carbides located at these boundaries and thus increased the magnitude of dispersion strengthening. The boundary strengthening contributed to overall YS significantly due to small lath thickness after tempering and nanoscale spacing between lamellar boundaries after tempforming.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper focuses on the effect of rapid annealing on Non-Grain Oriented Electrical Steel (NGO) in terms of microstructure, mechanical properties, and magnetic properties. The Ultra-Fast Heating (UFH) tests were performed by a transversal induction heater on NGO electrical steel samples (cold rolled down to 0.5 mm), varying the heating power (80 kW and 90 kW) and the speed of the strip through the induction heater. This allowed us to exploit heating rates (HR) in the range of 200–300 °C/s and targeting peak temperature (Tpeak) up to a maximum of 1250 °C. The comparison between the microstructure as obtained by conventional annealing and the ultra-fast heating process highlights a clear effect in terms of grain size refinement provided by the UFH. In particular, the average grain size as obtained by UFH ranges two/three times lower than by a conventional process. The results show the possibility of applying UFH to NGO steels, targeting mechanical properties such as those obtained by the standard process, combined with the benefits from this innovative heat treatment in terms of green energy and the minimization of CO2 emissions. Magnetic characterization performed by a single sheet tester (30 × 90 mm) showed that the values of core losses are comparable with conventional NGO grades.},

ABSTRACT = {To analyze the impact of different objective functions and additive manufacturing (AM) constraints on structural topology optimization, it is necessary to perform an in-depth comparative study. This analysis should consider specific structural design factors, such as compliance, volume, or stress minimization, and assess their effects on the topology optimization for AM. In addition, the inclusion of AM constraints can have a significant influence on various aspects, including optimal part geometry, part volume, support structure volume, and structural performance. Thus, it is essential to investigate and compare these factors to determine the optimal part design for AM. This study focuses on comparing topology optimization results obtained using compliance, stress, or multi-objective minimization, with and without AM constraints. A comparative analysis was conducted in the study, utilizing three structural design examples: cantilever beam, bridge-shaped structure, and L-shaped beam. The comparison results provide insights into the effects of build orientation, AM constraints such as overhang, and different design objectives on the structural topology optimization for AM.},

ABSTRACT = {The superior deposition rates of Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing (WAAM) allow for the production of a substantial number of parts while reducing the time and cost associated with machining, and have attracted significant attention. This study focused the microstructural and mechanical properties of a bimetallic thin-wall composed of SS308L and Inconel625, manufactured using variable-pressure rolling WAAM. A detailed analysis of the cross-sectional microstructure of the bi-metallic wall of non-pressure cases revealed a columnar solidification structure. In contrast, the pressured case was dominated by equiaxed structures. The microhardness tests conducted on the bimetallic interface revealed a hardness range of 139–188 HV within the SS308L region, and a 187–222 HV hardness spectrum within the Inconel625 region. The bimetallic interface displayed no unexpected hardness variations. Tensile tests carried out in the vertical direction across the bi-metallic interface resulted in a localized failure at the 308L region. The range of ultimate tensile strength was between 539 and 585 MPa, the yield strength varied from 344 to 377 MPa, and the elongation measurements were found to be within the range of 37 to 44%. All test specimens showed a consistent pattern of ductile rupture upon fractographic inspection, with fracture occurring in the SS308L region.},

ABSTRACT = {Medical teleconsultation was among the initial use cases for early telepresence research projects since medical treatment often requires timely intervention by highly specialized experts. When remote medical experts support interventions, a holistic view of the surgical site can increase situation awareness and improve team communication. A possible solution is the concept of immersive telepresence, where remote users virtually join the operating theater that is transmitted based on a real-time reconstruction of the local site. Enabled by the availability of RGB-D sensors and sufficient computing capability, it becomes possible to capture such a site in real time using multiple stationary sensors. The 3D reconstruction and simplification of textured surface meshes from the point clouds of a dynamic scene in real time is challenging and becomes infeasible for increasing capture volumes. This work presents a tightly integrated, stateless 3D reconstruction pipeline for dynamic, room-scale environments that generates simplified surface meshes from multiple RGB-D sensors in real time. Our algorithm operates directly on the fused, voxelized point cloud instead of populating signed-distance volumes per frame and using a marching cube variant for surface reconstruction. We extend the formulation of the dual contouring algorithm to work for point cloud data stored in an octree and interleave a vertex-clustering-based simplification before extracting the surface geometry. Our 3D reconstruction pipeline can perform a live reconstruction of six incoming depth videos at their native frame rate of 30 frames per second, enabling the reconstruction of smooth movement. Arbitrarily complex scene changes are possible since we do not store persistent information between frames. In terms of mesh quality and hole filling, our method falls between the direct mesh reconstruction and expensive global fitting of implicit functions.},

ABSTRACT = {The tremendous application potential of 3D bioprinting in the biomedical field is witnessed by the ever-increasing interest in this technology over the past few years. In particular, the possibility of obtaining 3D cellular models that mimic tissues with precision and reproducibility represents a definitive advance for in vitro studies dealing with the biological mechanisms of cell growth, death and proliferation and is at the basis of the responses of healthy and pathological tissues to drugs and therapies. However, the impact of 3D bioprinting on research is limited by the high costs of professional 3D bioprinters, which represent an obstacle to the widespread access and usability of this technology. In this work, we present a 3D bioprinter that was developed in-house by modifying a low-cost commercial 3D printer by replacing the default extruder used to print plastic filaments with a custom-made syringe extruder that is suitable for printing bioinks. The modifications made to the 3D printer include adjusting the size of the extruder to accommodate a 1 mL syringe and reducing the extruder’s size above the printer. To validate the performance of the home-made bioprinter, some main printing characteristics, the cell vitality and the possibility of bioprinting CAD-designed constructs were benchmarked against a renowned professional 3D bioprinter by RegenHu. According to our findings, our in-house 3D bioprinter was mostly successful in printing a complex glioblastoma tumor model with good performances, and it managed to maintain a cell viability that was comparable to that achieved by a professional bioprinter. This suggests that an accessible open-source 3D bioprinter could be a viable option for research and development (R&D) laboratories interested in pre-commercial 3D bioprinting advancements.},

ABSTRACT = {Although structural topology optimization has been developing for decades, it still plays a leading role within the area of engineering design. Solving contemporary design problems coming from industry requires the implementation of efficient methods and approaches. This stimulates research progress in the development of novel and versatile topology optimization algorithms. To follow these modern trends, an original topology generator has been elaborated and finally built as a Cellular Automaton with original update rules. The motivation for building the algorithm in this way came from the idea of utilizing the benefits of local compliances sorting. This is conducted on two levels: on the global level, the monotonic function mapping local compliances distribution is defined based on their sorted values; on the local level, for each cell, the compliances are sorted within the cell neighborhood. The three largest absolute values are selected, and these are the basis from which to formulate Cellular Automata update rules. These original rules can efficiently control the generation of structural topologies. This technique is somewhat inspired by the grey wolf optimizer strategy, wherein the process of updating design variables refers to the positions of the three best fitted wolves. It is proposed that we refer to the topology algorithm that benefits from the adaptation of sorted compliances optimization as TABASCO. The developed algorithm is a modified version of the flexible Cellular Automata one presented previously. The implemented extension, regarding the local level cell sorting, allows us to improve the resulting compliance values. The advantages of the algorithm, both from numerical and practical engineering points of view, as compared to the others developed within the field, may be gathered as follows: the algorithm works based on simple update rules, i.e., its numerical implementation is not complicated; it does not require gradient computations; filtering techniques are not needed; and it can easily be combined with professional structural analysis programs which allow engineering applications. The developed topology generator has been linked with ANSYS to show that it can be incorporated into a commercial structural analysis package. This is especially important with respect to the engineering implementations.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, a simulation model for Selective Laser Melting (SLM) technology is established to simulate the additive manufacturing process of a turbine impeller for an aerospace engine. By utilizing the simulation model, variations in laser power and scanning speed are employed to obtain simulated results of thermal deformation for the turbine impeller under different laser power and scanning speed conditions. The results indicate that the thermal deformation of the component increases with the augmentation of laser power, decreases with the escalation of scanning speed, and eventually stabilizes. Based on the relationship between thermal deformation and energy, the energy utilization efficiency of the SLM process under different conditions is calculated. The findings demonstrate that, within a certain range of power, the synergistic effect of laser power and scanning speed allows for an increase in energy utilization efficiency and a reduction in processing time while ensuring the mechanical performance of the formed parts. Consequently, this approach proves effective in lowering production costs for complex components based on SLM technology.},

ABSTRACT = {It is well established that the introduction of additive manufacturing in various domains has produced significant technological leaps due to the advantages over other manufacturing techniques. Furthermore, additive manufacturing allows the design of parts with complex internal structures (e.g., lattice, honeycomb) to achieve lightweight or other mechanical properties. This paper presents a computational model (integrated into a programable algorithm) designed to generate complex internal structures, using tree-like fractals, for components (mechanical parts) whose designs are achievable by additive manufacturing. The computational model is presented in detail, starting from the mathematical definition and the properties of the proposed tree-like fractals. The fractal data are computed and arranged unequivocally using table representations. Based on the fractal data, the structures are generated inside CAD parts (which are given as inputs in the algorithm). The proposed computational method is applied in different case studies to illustrate their functionality. The generated CAD components (with fractal internal structures) are intended for manufacturing (using selective laser melting) and laboratory (mechanical) testing and for finite element analysis, which in turn can validate the use of tree-like fractals as interior structures for mechanical components.},

ABSTRACT = {Additive manufacturing enables the realization of complex component designs that cannot be achieved with conventional processes, such as the integration of cellular structures, such as lattice structures, for weight reduction. To include lattice structures in component designs, an automated algorithm compatible with conventional CAD that is able to handle various lattice topologies as well as variable local shape parameters such as strut radii is required. Smooth node transitions are desired due to their advantages in terms of reduced stress concentrations and improved fatigue performance. The surface patch-based algorithm developed in this work is able to solidify given lattice frames to smooth lattice structures without manual construction steps. The algorithm requires only a few seconds of sketching time for each node and favours parallelisation. Automated special-case workarounds as well as fallback mechanisms are considered for non-standard inputs. The algorithm is demonstrated on irregular lattice topologies and applied for the construction of a lattice infill of an aircraft component that was additively manufactured.},

In addition, it is an innovative approach to tool management. An analysis of the feasibility of processing cobalt-added HSS powder steels was carried out for single clads and multilayer structures. The effect of process parameters (laser, beam power, travel speed, wire feed rate) on geometric properties, hardness and microstructure was discussed. In order to avoid cracking during multilayer deposition, an additional preheating to 320 °C was applied. Two sets of process parameters with high and low heat input were obtained. Both sets lead to crack-free structures that fulfill geometric (≥2.5 mm in height) and hardness (≥700 HV) requirements.},

ABSTRACT = {In this work, Non-penalisation Smooth-Edged Material Distribution for Optimising Topology (np-SEMDOT) algorithm was developed as an alternative to well-established Topology Optimisation (TO) methods based on the solid/void approach. Its novelty lies in its smoother edges and enhanced manufacturability, but it requires validation in a real case study rather than using simplified benchmark problems. To such an end, a Sheikh-Ibrahim steel girder joint’s tension cover plate was optimised with np-SEMDOT, following a methodology designed to ensure compliance with the European design standards. The optimisation was assessed with Physical Nonlinear Finite Element Analyses (PhNLFEA), after recent findings that topologically optimised steel construction joint parts were not accurately modelled with linear analyses to ensure the required highly nonlinear ultimate behaviour. The results prove, on the one hand, that the quality of np-SEMDOT solutions strongly depends on the chosen optimisation parameters, and on the other hand, that the optimal np-SEMDOT solution can equalise the ultimate capacity and can slightly outperform the ultimate displacement of a benchmarking solution using a Solid Isotropic Material with Penalisation (SIMP)-based approach. It can be concluded that np-SEMDOT does not fall short of the prevalent methods. These findings highlight the novelty in this work by validating the use of np-SEMDOT for professional applications.},

ABSTRACT = {The flow field around the grinding wheel prevents grinding fluid from entering the grinding area, which deteriorates machining conditions and reduces the quality of the workpiece. MQL (Minimum Quantity Lubrication) grinding uses compressed gas to improve the ability of the grinding fluid to pass through the flow field of the grinding wheel so that a small amount of the grinding fluid can meet the cooling and lubrication requirements and reduce the cost of using grinding fluid. In this study, we investigated the flow field of grinding wheels under MQL conditions and obtain the rules that influence factors such as grinding fluid flow rate, grinding wheel linear speed and compressed gas pressure affect the flow rate of grinding fluid. The simulation method was used to simulate the flow field of the grinding wheel and the trajectory of the grinding fluid droplets. The simulation results show that these factors are important ones affecting the effective flow rate of grinding fluid. Meanwhile, the experimental results verify that these factors have the same influence pattern on the effective flow rate and grinding temperature.},

ABSTRACT = {This study aims to investigate the mechanical properties of Functionally Graded Lattice Structures (FGLSs) and to determine their industrial application possibilities through additive manufacturing. For this purpose, lattice structures with uniform and horizontal, vertical and radially graded configurations are designed using auxetic unit cells were fabricated with RGD720 photopolymer resin using Material Jetting. FGLSs are compared with uniform structures in regards with deformation behavior, structural strength and energy absorption. The results showed that the most significant deviation in the strut diameters of the uniform lattice structures was seen in the rotation lattice structure at 8.2%. The lowest deviation was seen in the chiral structure, which deviated by 5.4%. The lowest deviations (between 3.4% and 9%) in FGLSs were obtained in chiral structures. The highest relative density value (0.3049 g/cm3) among all configurations was observed in the vertically graded chiral structure. The lowest relative density value (0.1865 g/cm3) was obtained in uniform re-entrant structures. According to the compression test results, the highest compressive stress (2.61513 MPa) and elastic modulus (84.63192 MPa) were formed in the rotation structure. The maximum energy absorption capacity value (19.381 KJ) and the maximum specific energy absorption value (3649.905 KJ/kg) were obtained in the uniform chiral structure.},

ABSTRACT = {This research examines the flexural fatigue response of 3D-printed foot orthoses produced from various thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) filaments, including Filaflex 60A, Filaflex 70A, Filaflex 82A, PolyFlex 90A, and varioShore. To subject the insoles to repeated flexion in the metatarsophalangeal area, specialized equipment was developed. A real-world testing scenario was applied to the Filaflex 82A insole, demonstrating that it can sustain over 1,400,000 steps over several months of normal walking (a cadence of approximately 120 steps per minute). Consequently, the experimental conditions were adjusted to double this pace to obtain pertinent results within a shorter testing timeframe. The insoles were subjected to 250 cycles per minute at constant clamping pressures of 176 kPa in the forefoot region. The objective of the evaluation was to determine if 700,000 testing cycles, equivalent to more than two and a half months of daily walking, would induce any damages in the internal structure (infill failure) or external condition (delamination, cracks) of the insoles. Except for compression marks, particularly notable on the foamed material (varioShore TPU) within the clamping zones of the testing device, none of the tested insoles exhibited any signs of external damage after 700,000 cycles. Moreover, the deformations observed in the insoles were non-permanent and nearly entirely disappeared within a few days of rest. The only insole that displayed deterioration of the infill structure was a TPU 82A insole that had been previously worn and then left on a shelf for approximately one year in uncontrolled conditions before being tested at repeated flexion on the apparatus. Additionally, a fifteen-minute walking test was carried out to assess the comfort of each insole, and it was found that the varioShore model, which had a 20% infill density and was 3D-printed at a temperature of 220 °C, stood out as the most comfortable among the tested insoles.},

ABSTRACT = {Recent advancements in 3D printing technology have integrated with Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies such as robotics and artificial intelligence, aiming to overcome the limitations of conventional manufacturing methods. In the field of functional foods, solvent casting, a common manufacturing technique, has been adopted to produce film-like structures with desired sizes and uniform thickness. However, the typical method of coating or injection on a conventional continuous film is difficult to produce in small amounts. To address this limitation, in the study, we developed a pneumatic pressure syringe-type dispensing system integrated with a food 3D printer utilizing fused deposition modeling (FDM) technology. A syringe type is needed to discharge crude liquid manufactured in the food field in a hygienic environment, and a 3D printing method that is easy to manufacture in small quantities or on demand was utilized. Through simulation and experiment, we wanted to confirm whether stable ejection results are generated according to the selected nozzle-based viscosity, inflow conditions, and the nozzle movement path of the food 3D printer. Based on the nozzle selected through simulation, it was confirmed that the fluid and flow velocity distribution of the viscous material were uniformly distributed and discharged under the conditions of 30,000 cps and inflow rate. By setting the parameters of the food 3D printer and preparing a coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) sample, we achieved a stable oral dissolving film (ODF) extrusion shape through the design of viscosity and 3D printer nozzle path. The optimal viscosity range for the ODF solution was found to be 25,000 to 35,000 cps, exhibiting precise dimensions and shapes without distortion and yielding the most stable extrusion results. We defined four different nozzle path designs based on minimizing the movement of the 3D printer nozzle. Among them, a 16-step path design demonstrated a stable extrusion method, showing no tailing phenomenon under the conditions of 0.2 MPa pressure and −15.4 KPa vacuum pressure. In future research, we plan to conduct additional research to determine whether the discharge results vary depending on conditions such as viscosity of the crude liquid, nozzle path combination, and ODF thickness.},

ABSTRACT = {The research problem is oriented to shortening the development time of products for the automotive and engineering industry and to improving their output properties, such as weight reduction by implementation of advanced design methods (DfAMs). The intention of the study is to achieve positive properties in components and to shorten the development phase when applying DfAM methods, specifically the use of topological optimization (TO). In development of the design methodology using TO, the procedure and results were addressed and consulted with a specific manufacturer in the industry who provided the necessary materials for the research. The methodology was formed based on the partial results and their analysis for selecting the right solutions, such as the analysis of traditional procedures, strength checks, meshes, boundary conditions, etc. The procedure and design were focused and limited to additive manufacturing, specifically SLM. The results agreed with the research aim, and a significant reduction in times was achieved over traditional design methods. There was also a reduction in masses. The research concludes with an evaluation of the results together with those of the manufacturer, and a statement of the benefits, particularly for the scientific discipline and practice. It was concluded that, by implementing the given design methods, it is possible to significantly reduce the financial costs with proper application, simplify the operation of design software and create the possibility of use in training workplaces. With further research and extension of the applicability of the given methodology, substantial positive factors for development can be assumed. However, it should not be forgotten that the use of DfAM methods is greatly influenced by advances in additive manufacturing.},

ABSTRACT = {The chatter that occurs during the turning operation, especially when cutting a slender and flexible shaft, determines the surface quality of the workpiece and the stability of the machining system. However, when building a dynamic model of a slender workpiece with a chuck and tailstock, it is generally regarded as a cantilever or simply supported beam, without consideration of the axial force and supported stiffness effect. In this work, a dynamic model for thin and flexible workpieces with different clamping boundary conditions was first built. Then, a finite element analysis (FEA) was used to study the influence of the axial force and supporting stiffness on the mode frequencies of the workpiece. A further analysis found that the relationship between support stiffness, axial force, and the dynamic response of the workpiece is nonlinear and far more complex than that of the simply supported beam model. The clamping force directly influenced the magnitude of the vibration response with the decrease of shaft stiffness during the turning process. These results were verified experimentally by measuring the vibrational response of slender shafts with different clamping modes using an on-rotor sensing (ORS) system. It proved that the proposed model shows advantages for the identification of dynamic vibration and quality control when machining slender workpieces.},

ABSTRACT = {This study presents the development of insoles using 3D scanning and additive manufacturing; additionally, the feasibility of implementing cellular structures in their design was evaluated. Using finite element models, the displacements and Von Mises stresses in the insoles were obtained considering the exerted pressures of a person during walking. The insoles developed in this work presented a decrease of 91.48% in deformation while the maximum Von Mises stress increased by 32.62%, compared with what other authors reported. The Von Mises stresses and displacements in the insole were calculated when two cellular topologies, triply periodic minimal surfaces (TPMS) and body-centered cubic (BCC), and different relative densities (10.33%, 14.67%, and 20.19%) were implemented. When compared to solid insoles, the Von Mises stresses and displacements for the models with cellular structures increased. The maximum Von Mises stresses and displacements resulted for the insoles with a relative density of 10.33%; for the insole with the BCC cellular structure, the displacement was 2.06 mm, and the Von Mises stress was 22.17 MPa, while for the TPMS structure, these were 2.7 mm and 23.84 MPa, respectively. The designs were additively manufactured, and the printing defects were visually characterized.},

ABSTRACT = {Additive manufacturing processes continue to grow in popularity. Hereby, metal binder jetting (MBJ) has a high potential for series production of highly complex parts with added value compared to other production technologies. Applications already exist in thermal management, filtering, or fluid distribution. As with beam-based additive manufacturing processes, the materials available for MBJ are still limited. Especially in the area of nickel-free stainless steels; for example, for medical applications, there are hardly any options available. Therefore, this study investigates a newly developed nickel-free stainless steel specifically designed for the MBJ process. Particular attention is paid to the microstructure and the mechanical properties such as hardness and tensile strength. In addition, the investigation focuses on the potential of hot isostatic pressing (HIP) after sintering to favorably influence the microstructure and the mechanical properties. The results show that in the as-sintered state, a maximum porosity of 2.8% is present, which can be completely removed by hot isostatic post-densification. HIP post-densification improves both the yield strength and the tensile strength by about 10%. The increase in elongation at break is around 50%.},

ABSTRACT = {The integration of topology optimization into additive manufacturing provides unmatched possibilities for the sustainable manufacturing of lightweight, intricate, custom parts with less material at a lower production time and cost. This study aims to apply and benchmark topology optimization methods, in conjunction with additive manufacturing, to enhance the design of functional components used in aerospace applications, while simultaneously providing an experimental verification and comparative analysis of such optimization techniques. This approach was applied to an industrial bracket used in aerospace applications, which was optimized with the aim of weight reduction without sacrificing its original mechanical stiffness. A density-based technique and a level-set method were used to perform the analysis and optimization, whereas fabrication was performed using fused deposition modeling. Finally, a compression and tensile testing machine was employed for the testing, verification, and comparison of the exhibited mechanical strength for the whole range of printed parts, under the same load conditions. The optimized designs achieved a 20% weight reduction while maintaining the compression displacement of the initial components at the given load. The achieved results demonstrate that topologically optimized components can significantly enhance the design of real-life components, such as those used in the weight-sensitive industrial applications considered in this work.},

ABSTRACT = {Shape memory polymers (SMPs), a class of polymers exhibiting the unique ability to restore deformation induced during the programming process in response to external stimuli, have garnered significant attention. In this study, our objectives were two-fold: to develop an efficient device for programming SMP hinges crafted from polyetheretherketon (PEEK) and to optimize their performance for potential utilization in space applications. Two versions of the programming device were constructed and compared. Through three systematic experiments, we identified optimal programming and recovery conditions for the hinges, revealing the best shape memory effects (SMEs) at a programming temperature of 250 °C. Remarkably, the hinges were able to recover the previously induced deformation up to 100%, maintaining functionality down to a lower temperature limit of 150 °C. Notably, these hinges demonstrated a wide operational range of over 180°, rendering them promising for space applications, as extensively discussed within the manuscript. However, challenges arise due to the high recovery temperature of 150 °C, presenting obstacles in achieving optimal functionality in the demanding conditions of a space environment.},

ABSTRACT = {Lattice and gyroid structures are often subjected to additive technologies to produce various types of products, and the current market has a number of 3D printers that can be used for their production. The quality of the products produced in this way can be assessed on the basis of technical parameters and the filament used. Such an approach, however, is insufficient. In terms of quality, other product parameters need to be assessed, such as the surface texture and the internal structure’s porosity. For such an assessment, we can use the industrial tomography method and the method of roughness measurement via an optical microscope. The paper presents research on the assessment of the surface texture and porosity in lattice and gyroid structures. For the research, two types of test specimens—a specimen with a lattice structure and a specimen with a gyroid structure—were prepared. The obtained results proved that the 3D printing technology directly impacted the surface texture and porosity. For experimental specimens produced by SLS technology, we found that it was very important to carefully remove the excess powder, as unremoved powder can significantly affect the porosity results. For specimens produced by FDM technology, the research confirmed that some “gaps” between the layers were not pores but defects created during specimen production. When analyzing the surface using the Alicon Infinite G5 optical microscope, we found that the measured roughness results were directly impacted by the specimen’s surface color, the structure’s geometry, and the ambient light, which was confirmed by a red lattice experimental specimen, the surface of which could not be scanned. Based on the above, it can be stated that the selection of 3D technology for additive production needs must be given adequate attention regarding the quality of the created structures and textures.},

ABSTRACT = {Plasma arc deposition as an additive manufacturing technology has unique advantages for producing parts with complex shapes through layer-by-layer deposition. It is critical to predict and control the temperature field during the production process due to the temperature distribution and gradients determining the properties and performance of the part. Numerical simulation approaches, such as the finite element method, which provides a large amount of data for machine learning modeling, thus reducing the overhead of experimental measurements, are widely used in machine learning. In this paper, we propose a neural network combined finite element method and process prediction workflow. A one-dimensional convolutional neural network model for predicting 2D temperature distribution is developed by training the collected data on the planar temperature field of titanium–aluminum twin-wire plasma arc additive manufacturing and the finite element method. The results show that the predicted temperature mean square error is only 0.5, with less than a 20 °C error in peak temperature and a relative error below 1%. The proposed transfer learning method achieves the same training loss and is 500 iterations faster than basic training, which improves the training speed by 25%. The current study confirms the accurate performance of the ML model and the effectiveness of the optimization method.},

ABSTRACT = {Post-fabrication heat treatment (PFHT) is one of the most applied strategies for achieving the desired microstructure and mechanical resistance on additive manufactured components because of the non-equilibrium microstructural state of the material in the as-built condition. In particular, during PFHT, 17-4 PH martensitic stainless steel is mainly strengthened by the precipitation of Cu-rich nanometric particles and Nb carbides into the metal matrix. In this work, the influence of specifically designed PFHTs on the microstructural and mechanical properties of 17-4 PH single tracks fabricated via direct energy deposition was studied. Different solubilization and aging times, as well as a direct aging strategy, were considered. Optical microscopy, X-ray diffractometry, and transmission electron microscopy were used to investigate the microstructure evolution induced by the PFHTs. Moreover, Vickers microhardness measurements were performed to evaluate the increase in mechanical strength. In all cases, the heat-treated single tracks showed a mean microhardness higher than that of the depositions in the as-built condition. In the single tracks subjected to solution treatment, followed by aging for about 100 h, the presence of both Cu-rich precipitates and Nb carbides was assessed; conversely, when directly aged from the as-built condition, only Nb carbides were detected. In the latter case, the carbides were finer and closer to each other than those in the single tracks aged after the solution treatment.},

ABSTRACT = {The process of atomizing aluminum alloy powder using a rotating disk was studied by numerical simulation and experimental verification. The motion characteristics of the molten metal thin liquid film and the evolution law of atomization into droplets were systematically studied with different disk shapes and speeds. The results showed that the slippage of the liquid film on the surface of the spherical disk was smaller, the liquid film spread more evenly, and the velocity distribution was more uniform. Under the same working condition, the boundary diameter of the continuous liquid film on the spherical disk was 21–29% larger, and the maximum liquid film velocity increased by approximately 19%. In other words, the liquid film obtained more energy at the same rotational speed, the energy utilization rate was higher, and the liquid filaments produced by the splitting region of the disk surface were finer and greater in number. The data showed that the average thickness of the liquid film on the surfaces of different disk shapes was more affected by the speed of the flat disk, and the thickness on the spherical disk was relatively stable and uniform, but the difference in thickness between the two disk shapes decreased from 4.2 μm to 0.3 μm when the speed increased from 10,000 rpm to 60,000 rpm. In particular, the influence of the disk shape on the liquid film thickness became smaller when the speed increased to a certain range. At the same time, the characteristics of the liquid film during the spreading movement of molten metal on the disk and the mechanisms of the primary and secondary breakage of the liquid film were obtained through this simulation study.},

ABSTRACT = {The 100CrMo7, commonly employed for bearings in rotating machinery, relies on precise heat treatment parameters to ensure an optimal microstructure and, in turn, mechanical properties. Typically, an austenitizing treatment, followed by rapid cooling in a salt bath for martempering or austempering, is crucial in achieving the desired microstructure and hardness. The present industrial-scale study involved a comparative analysis between martempering and austempering routes regarding the hardness and microstructure evolution of EN 100CrMo7 large-size rings. The investigation delves into the effects of austempering temperatures, holding times, and austenitizing temperature. Furthermore, the role of tempering in reducing the amount of retained austenite was also considered. The results indicate that martempering yielded the highest hardness values while austempering exhibited a decrease in hardness at the center of the rings, though a lower amount of retained austenite (in the range of 3.0–4.9 vol.%) was detected in comparison with martempering. In addition, a 850 °C austenitizing temperature reduced the hardness by 16% in the center of the rings and promoted a high content of upper bainite, thus suggesting its inefficacy for the involved large-size rings. In contrast, a 880 °C austenitizing temperature maintained consistently high HRC values across the ring’s height. Lastly, the analysis highlighted that the cooling rate played a more crucial role than the austempering holding time. Such industrial-scale investigations performed on real components improve the knowledge and control of heat treatment parameters in comparison with the nominal guidelines provided by steel suppliers. These outcomes offer insights for optimizing industrial heat treatment parameters, with practical implications for enhancing steel bearings’ microstructural and mechanical performance and lifespan.},

ABSTRACT = {Analyses in the present work focus on understanding the influence of the WAAM (wire arc additive manufacturing) deposition pattern and travel speed on residual stress and warpage in aluminum alloy. The thermal profiles are analyzed using thermomechanical FE simulations. Analysis shows that the out–in deposition pattern leads to the highest level of residual stress and warpage. It is also found that an increase in the travel speed decreases the peak temperature and thermal gradient during the AM deposition, which results in a lower level of residual stress generation. A comparison of results for the line-type patterns (raster and alternate) suggests that the deposition interval between each deposition has little influence on thermal profiles, residual stress generation, and warpage. However, the contour-type patterns significantly affect the heat transfer, thermal gradient, and cooling rate during the AM deposition.},

ABSTRACT = {Additive manufacturing procedures are being increasingly developed, from prototyping to finished functional products. However, their rapid development also brings along the testing of properties with different manufacturing parameters. In selective laser sintering, the most influential manufacturing parameter is the energy density, which also consists, among other things, of the hatch distance. For better usage of the entire chamber and a reduction in the overall price of the finished product, in practice, the manufacturing of products at different heights (levels) of the working chamber with different orientations is inevitable. The study examines how hatch distance and product orientation impact the tensile strength and dimensional stability of polyamide products across two levels within the chamber. Upon analysis, it was observed that manufacturing products at different levels within the working chamber does not influence their dimensions. Achieving precise product dimensions comparable to those in the CAD model is possible. Furthermore, the same factors (orientation and hatch distance) and their combinations affect the length, thickness, and width of the product. Although all test specimens were tested, a tensile strength analysis of variance (ANOVA) of test specimens produced at the lower level of the chamber with a combination of hatch distance (ranging from 0.23 to 0.6 mm) and orientation (ranging from 0° to 60°) was not feasible in the design of the experiment. Despite this limitation, it was noted that both chamber levels had the potential to reach a maximum tensile strength of 47 N/mm2. Nevertheless, the average tensile strength of PA12, obtained through combinations of input factors, stood at only 30 N/mm2, which is quite a low value for polyamide made by selective laser sintering.},

ABSTRACT = {Multifunctional composites provide more than one function from the same part. The anisotropy, material, and process characterization challenges and the lack of standardization on the 3D-printed multifunctional carbon composites make it difficult for application into aerospace. The current solutions for additive manufacturing (AM) technologies and additively manufactured monofunctional and multifunctional composites are not mature enough for safety-critical applications. A new approach is proposed to explore the use of machine learning (ML) in the design, development, AM, testing, and certification of multifunctional composites for aircraft, unmanned aircraft systems (UAS), and spacecraft. In this work, an artificial neural network (ANN) architecture is proposed. An AM-embedded building block approach integrates the complete lifecycle of aircraft, UAS, and spacecraft using ANN to support the continued operational safety (COS) of aircraft, spacecraft, and UAS. The proposed method exploits the power of ANN on the metadata for the characterization of multifunctional material properties and processes and the mapping of the failure modes compared with the predicted models and history. This paper provides an in-depth analysis and explanation of the new methods needed to overcome the existing barriers, problems, and situations.},

ABSTRACT = {Invasive alien plant species (IAPS) may cause threats to native biodiversity in ecosystems. Researchers have been investigating all the possible ways that they can be used effectively for other purposes. Since IAPS are capable of forming cellulose fibre nets, in this research, papers were made from three different types of IAPS (Japanese knotweed, giant goldenrod, and black locust). This research examined these IAPS papers and their effectiveness when used as printing substrates. In comparison to commercial office paper, the differences in basic, surface, optical, and microscopic properties were measured. As a widely used technology, inkjet printing was applied. We tested a commonly used sans-serif typeface (which has been established as being more legible than other typefaces in previous research) in three different type sizes (i.e., 8, 10, and 12 pt). According to the results, paper made from IAPS could offer some usable properties and acceptable legibility, especially when printing typefaces with specific attributes, such as moderate counter size, higher x-height, and minimal differences in the letter stroke width, are used. An appropriate typographic tonal density should be achieved in combination with an adequate letter size, e.g., 10 pt type size when a sans-serif typeface is used.},

ABSTRACT = {Alloy 800H stands as one of the few code-qualified materials for fabricating in-core and out-of-core components operating in high-temperature reactors. Welding is a common practice for assembling these components; however, the selection of a suitable filler material is essential for enhancing the high-temperature creep resistance of Alloy 800H weldments in high-temperature applications. In this study, Inconel 625 and Haynes 230 filler materials were used to weld Alloy 800H plates by employing the gas tungsten arc welding technique. The high-temperature tensile and creep rupture properties, microstructural stability, and evolution of the weldments after high-temperature exposure were investigated and compared with those of Alloy 800H. The results show that both weldments exhibit enhanced tensile and creep behavior at 760 °C. The creep rupture times of the weldments with Inconel 625 filler and Haynes 230 filler materials were about two and three time longer, respectively, than those of Alloy 800H base metal when tested at 80 MPa and 760 °C. Carbides (MC and M23C6) were commonly observed in the microstructures of both the weld and base metals in the two weldments after high-temperature creep tests. However, the Inconel 625 filler weldment displayed detrimental δ and Laves phases in the fusion zone, and these precipitates could be potential sites for initiating cracks following prolonged high-temperature exposure. This study shows that the weldment with Haynes 230 filler material exhibit better phase stability and creep rupture properties than the one with Inconel 625, suggesting its potential for use as a candidate filler material for Alloy 800H for further investigation. This finding also emphasizes the critical consideration of microstructural evolutions and phase stability in evaluating high-temperature materials and their weldments in high-temperature reactor applications.},

ABSTRACT = {This study aims to describe the numerical modeling and nonlinear finite element analysis of typical spinal braces as a first step towards optimizing their topology for 3D printing. Numerical simulation was carried out in Abaqus CAE software Version 2021, utilizing a CAD (Meshmixer Version 3.5.474) scan of an actual spinal brace. Boundary conditions were defined by means of contact surfaces between the human body and the supporting pads located in the interior of the brace. The process of tightening the straps on the rear face of the brace was simulated via appropriate imposed displacements. The response is described through the deformations and developing stresses of the brace and the contact pressures in the areas of interaction with the human body. Parametric analysis indicated that increasing the cross-sectional thickness or elastic modulus of the brace material results in higher maximum von Mises stresses and lower displacements. The comparison between 3D-printed and conventional braces highlighted the potential of 3D-printing technology to achieve comparable performance with customized designs, leveraging the constitutive properties of 3D-printed material obtained from tension tests. The tension tests demonstrated that the 3D-printed material achieved higher values of modulus of elasticity compared to traditional brace materials. Finally, the topology optimization criteria to be applied for the design of spinal braces in the next step of this ongoing research are briefly described.},

ABSTRACT = {Thermoplastic polymers are widely used in industry to generate parts with reasonable production costs, lightweight, chemical stability, sustainability, and recyclability compared to other materials such as metals, metalloids, or even thermoset polymers. The innovative additive manufacturing (AM) techniques, e.g., fused deposition modelling (FDM), can be used to fabricate thermoplastic products with complex geometries and specific properties. However, the mechanical integrity of those FDM-printed plastic parts can be greatly impacted by a phenomenon named material anisotropy. In this study, an experimental study on a popular 3D printing polymer material—acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS)—is performed to determine how FDM process parameters affect the mechanical properties of the printed ABS parts. This study uniquely concentrates on investigating mechanical anisotropy in FDM-printed ABS, delving into a combination of key printing parameters for a comprehensive exploration. Meanwhile, a finite-element-based numerical analysis is also utilised to numerically evaluate the influences of infill percentage and build orientations on the mechanical properties of the 3D-printed ABS materials for comparison. It generates a better understanding of material anisotropy and helps to find the optimal FDM process parameters to print high-quality ABS parts and may attract industrial interests in transitioning from traditional ABS part production methods such as injection moulding or hot pressing to additive manufacturing.},

ABSTRACT = {Having garnered significant attention in the scientific community over the past decade, wire-arc directed energy deposition (arc-DED) technology is at the heart of this investigation into additive manufacturing parameters. Singularly focused on Invar as the selected material, the primary objective revolves around devising a virtual sensor for the indirect size measurement of the bead. This innovative methodology involves the seamless integration of internal signals and sensors, enabling the derivation of crucial measurements sans the requirement for direct physical interaction or conventional measurement methodologies. The internal signals recorded, the comprising voltage, the current, the energy from the welding heat source generator, the wire feed speed from the feeding system, the traverse speed from the machine axes, and the temperature from a pyrometer located in the head were all captured through the control of the machine specially dedicated to the arc-DED process during a phase of optimizing and modeling the bead geometry. Finally, a feedforward neural network (FNN), also known as a multi-layer perceptron (MLP), is designed, with the internal signals serving as the input and the height and width of the bead constituting the output. Remarkably cost-effective, this solution circumvents the need for intricate measurements and significantly contributes to the proper layer-by-layer growth process. Furthermore, a neural network model is implemented with a test loss of 0.144 and a test accuracy of 1.0 in order to predict weld bead geometry based on process parameters, thus offering a promising approach for real-time monitoring and defect detection.},

ABSTRACT = {Fused deposition modeling (FDM) is widely employed in prototyping due to its cost-effectiveness, speed, and ability to produce detailed and functional prototypes using a variety of materials. Simultaneously, consideration for the use of biodegradable polymers and a general reduction in their usage while enhancing the production of polymer-based products is at the forefront of sustainable practices and environmental consciousness. This study investigates the impact fracture resistance of FDM models fabricated from Polylactic Acid (PLA), examining the influence of infill density (50% and 100% infill) and sample thickness (2 mm, 3 mm, and 5 mm). Optical microscopy, FTIR spectroscopy, and SEM analysis of PLA filament and fractured FDM PLA surfaces in impacted samples were conducted to ascertain the influence of process parameters on impact damage and failure mechanisms. The results indicate that a 100% infill profile with a 2 mm thickness should be avoided due to unpredictable behavior under impact. Conversely, a 5 mm thickness demonstrates significantly higher durability in comparison to a 50% infill profile. Optimal impact strength is observed in samples with a 3 mm thickness, suggesting potential material savings with 50% infill without compromising mechanical properties. The findings contribute valuable insights for refining FDM parameters and advancing the understanding of material behaviors in sustainable manufacturing practices.},

ABSTRACT = {As additive manufacturing (AM) processes become integrated with artificial intelligence systems, the time and cost of the fabrication process decrease. In this study, the raster angle, an important parameter in the manufacturing process, was examined using fused deposition modeling (FDM), an AM method. The optimal value of this parameter varies depending on the designed product geometry. By changing the raster angle, the distribution of stresses and strains within the printed object can be modified, potentially influencing the mechanical behavior of the object. Thus, the correct estimation of the raster angle is essential for obtaining parts with high mechanical properties. The focus of this study is to reduce the fabrication time and cost of products by intertwining machine learning (ML) systems with mechanical systems. Its novelty is that ML has never been applied for FDM raster angle estimation. The estimation and modeling of the raster angle were performed using five different ML algorithms. These algorithms include a support vector machine (SVM), Gaussian process regression (GPR), an artificial neural network (ANN), decision tree regression (DTR), and random forest regression (RFR). Data for training were generated using various shapes and geometries, then trained in the MATLAB software, and a prediction model between the input parameters and the raster angle was created. The predicted model was evaluated using five performance criteria. The RFR model predicts the raster angle in the FDM test data with R-squared (R2) = 0.92, an explained variance score (EVS) = 0.92, a mean absolute error (MAE) = 0.012, a root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.056, and a mean squared error (MSE) = 0.0032. These values are R2 = 0.93, EVS = 0.93, MAE = 0.010, RMSE = 0.051, and MSE0.0025 for the training data. RFR is significantly superior to the other prediction algorithms. The proposed model predicts the optimum raster angle for any geometry.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper proposes a series of experimental determinations carried out with the aim of generating new conclusions regarding the ability of 3D-printed gears to be integrated into mechanisms without lubrication. The main factors that influence the appearance of wear in non-lubricated contact are sliding speed, material hardness, surface finish, surface geometry, and material microstructure. The tests considered the type of material from which they were made and the 3D printing technology type. For testing the gear wheels, a mechatronic experimental setup was made consisting of two shafts with adjustable axial distances, a wheel loading system gears, an electric motor, and a command-and-control system. In terms of materials, four types of materials were monitored: PA (polyamide), PLA (polylactic acid), ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene) and PP (photopolymer). The evaluation of the gear wear was carried out by checking the gearing on two flanks (Frenco ZWP 06) and by scanning with the ATOS CORE 135 3D scanner. The PA and PP gears failed to meet the structural integrity standards after the tests. The PLA gears exhibited superior resistance to abrasive wear compared to the ABS gears, whereas the ABS gears generally demonstrated stronger structural integrity.},

The electrical resistivity of the printed Ag–Ni after an intense pulse light sintering was comparable to that of commercial indium tin oxide transparent films.},

ABSTRACT = {The current study sought to investigate the changes in surface hardness, roughness, and moisture absorption of the Vertex ThermoSens polymer (Vertex Dental, 3D Systems, The Netherlands) following immersion in artificial saliva for various periods (7, 14, and 28 days). A total of 60 rectangular specimens with dimensions of 20 mm in length, 20 mm in width, and 3 mm in thickness were made. Due to insufficient mold solidification, these specimens were made utilizing the injection molding process. A Mitutoyo Surftest 4 roughness meter (Mitutoyo, Aurora, IL, USA) was used to measure the surface roughness of the test materials. The ThermoSens polymer hardness was assessed using the Shor method and D—HSD scale, while absorption was measured with a Sartorius analytical balance. Results indicated the highest mean hardness after 28 days (M = 77.6) (Surface 1) and the lowest for the control group (M = 59) (Surface 2). The maximum surface roughness occurred in direction 2.2 pre-immersion (Ra = 2.88 μm) and 7 days post-removal (Ra = 2.95 μm). The control group exhibited the lowest absorption (Wsp = 1.524 mg/mm3), with the highest mean values over 28 days (Wsp = 1.541 mg/mm3). The elevated flask and plaster temperature slowed polymer solidification, resulting in longer macromolecules and improved mechanical properties and surface features.},

ABSTRACT = {Lattice materials are regarded as a new family of promising materials with high specific strength and low density. However, in the optimization of lattice materials, it is difficult in general to determine the material distribution in lattice structures due to the complex optimization formulations and overlaps between different materials. Thus, the article proposes to use the Nash equilibrium to address the multi-material optimization problem. Moreover, a suppression formula is investigated to tackle the issue of material overlapping. The proposed method is validated using a cantilever beam example, showing superior optimization results compared to single-material methods, with a maximum improvement of 20.5%. Moreover, the feasibility and stability of the approach are evaluated through L-shaped beam examples, demonstrating its capability to effectively allocate materials based on their properties and associated stress conditions within the design. Additionally, an MBB test demonstrates superior stiffness in the proposed optimized specimen compared to the unoptimized one.},

ABSTRACT = {Recently, for the high performance of automobiles, the application ratio of zinc-coated steel sheets with excellent corrosion resistance has been increasing. However, it is difficult to achieve sound welds, as porosities form from zinc during welding. In this study, a laser welding process, with the addition of a pretreatment step to conventional laser welding, was devised to improve weld quality by eliminating pores caused by zinc in the welds. Laser welding was performed on the overlapping joint of hot-dip galvanized steel sheets (SGARC 340, Hyundai Steel., Suncheon-Si, Jeollanam-do, Republic of Korea), with a thickness of 1.2 mm in the upper sheet and 0.9 mm in the lower sheet, and the welding characteristics were investigated by varying the laser power and focal position. Compared to conventional laser welding, the three-step laser stitch welding process significantly reduced the degree of spatter generation and welding defects. Additionally, it increased the tensile–shear load by approximately 37%. Moreover, the reduction in the zinc component of the three-step laser stitch welds was confirmed through SEM-EDS analysis. These findings contribute valuable information for securing high-quality welding joints and effectively addressing zinc-coated steel sheet welding quality issues in the automotive and industrial sectors.},

ABSTRACT = {Configuring complex computer-aided design (CAD) assemblies just by modifying parameters requires the attention and abstraction of the users. This interaction cost can be lowered significantly by graphical interactive control elements that allow for drag and drop modifications directly in the 3D assembly. Contributing techniques, such as working with skeletons and advanced or external knowledge-based parameter control, are available. This contribution examines their integration and implementation into a given CAD system through a case study on creating a pipe routing configuration system which uses drag points to adjust the position of instrumentation and routing segments. The results are then generalized to functional requirements and basic design features of such graphical interactive configurators.},

ABSTRACT = {Producing sustainable microfluidic devices on a large scale has become a trend in the biomedical field. However, the transition from laboratory prototyping to large-scale industrial production poses several challenges due to the gap between academia and industry. In this context, prototyping with a mass production approach could be the novel strategy necessary to bridge academic research to the market. Here, the performance of polymer inserts to produce PMMA microfluidic devices using the microinjection moulding process is presented. Inserts were fabricated with an additive manufacturing process: material jetting technology. The importance of the inserts’ orientation on the printing plate in order to produce samples with more uniform thickness and lower roughness has been demonstrated using a flat cavity insert. In addition, preliminary tests were carried out on microstructured inserts with inverted channels of various cross-section shapes (semi-circular or trapezoidal) and widths (200 or 300 µm) in order to investigate the microstructures’ resistance during the moulding cycles. The best geometry was found in the channel with the trapezoidal cross-section with a width equal to 300 µm. Finally, a preliminary microfluidic test was performed to demonstrate the devices’ workability.},

ABSTRACT = {Additive manufacturing (AM) technologies provide significant design freedom, which is highly desirable in today’s fast-paced product design processes. However, most of the parametric CAD software tools used today do not fully utilize this potential for freedom of form and design. Design mechanisms, such as topology optimization (TO), generative design (GD), and lattice structures, are available on the market to help designers minimize weight and material cost while maximizing the stiffness and flexibility of planned designs. This paper proposes a benchmarking approach for designers and engineers to select a suitable software tool for lattice structure generation for their specific applications. The approach includes preselecting software tools based on a weighted point evaluation of seven significant criteria. The tools are then evaluated based on key metrics such as computing time and file size of exported structures, as well as the following six distinctive attributes: usability, reliability, availability, performance, support, and cost. The evaluation process considers a total of 32 defined features. The investigation produced clear recommendations regarding overall performance, reliability, and user experience. The findings indicate that the option of a comprehensive support offering, as well as the initial and operational costs, are significant drivers in the decision-making process.},

ABSTRACT = {Temperature is very important in the fabrication of products developed for different applications, considering the widespread use of additive manufacturing (AM) technology. Thermal properties seriously affect the mechanical properties of products. In this study, the effect of printing nozzle temperature changes on the dimensional and mechanical properties of samples fabricated with acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) material was investigated. This material can be preferred over foam material for drone and model aircraft areas due to its low density. A total of thirty-six tensile test samples (ISO527–type1A) were fabricated with fused filament fabrication (FFF), one of the AM methods, and their dimensional properties (length, width, thickness, and mass) were determined. During the fabrication process, the nozzle temperature of the 3D (three-dimensional) printer was increased from 220 °C to 270 °C in 10 °C increments. All samples were subjected to tensile testing, and stress–strain values were measured. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was applied to examine the effect of nozzle temperature change on the findings obtained as a result of the experimental study. The printing nozzle temperature significantly affected both the mechanical strength and dimensional properties of the samples. The samples showed lower viscosity and less hardness at higher nozzle temperatures. The mass and density of the samples decreased with increasing temperature. The tensile strength value decreased by 41.52%.},

ABSTRACT = {Non-metallic additive manufacturing technology has seen a substantial improvement in the precision of the parts it produces. Its capability to achieve complex geometries and very small dimensions makes it suitable for integration into strategic industrial sectors, such as aeronautics and medicine. Among additive manufacturing technologies, resin development processes demonstrate enhanced precision when compared to other methods, like filament printing. This study conducts a comparative analysis between digital light processing (DLP) and liquid crystal display (LCD) photopolymerization processes to assess the performance of the technologies and how process parameters affect the accuracy of the resulting parts. The research evaluates the impact of the discretization process used during the digital model export, determining the optimal mesh size and then analyzing the geometric deviations that occur by altering various operating parameters of the process. Statistical methods will be employed to identify the most significant parameters in the manufacturing process. Among other aspects, the precision of manufacturing technologies regarding the movement axis has also been evaluated. Regarding the minimum size of the features that can be fabricated, DLP technology has surpassed LCD technology, successfully producing features as small as 200 µm, compared to 500 µm for LCD technology.},

ABSTRACT = {Additive manufacturing (AM) offers new possibilities in soft robotics as materials can easily be combined in multi-material designs. Proper sensing is essential for the soft actuators to interact with the surroundings successfully. By fabricating sensors through AM, sensors can be embedded directly into the components during manufacturing. This paper investigates NinjaTek Eels electrical resistance response to strain and the feasibility of using the material to create strain sensors. Strain sensors were 3D-printed out of NinjaTek Eel, a soft conductive TPU, and was tested during cyclic loading. A custom resistance–strain test rig was developed for measuring sensor behavior. The rig was calibrated for electric resistance, able to measure electric resistance as a function of strain. A parabolic response curve was observed during cyclic loading, which led to ambiguous readings. A 10-specimen validation test was conducted, evaluating the statistical variation for the first 100 loading cycles. The validation test showed that the sensor is capable of accurate and predictable readings during single load cases and cyclic loading, with the overall root mean square error being 66.9 Ω. Combining two sensors of different cross-sections gave promising results in terms of calibrating. By monitoring load cycles and strain rates, calibration can also be achieved by machine learning models by the microcontroller used to extract data. The presented work in this article explores the potential of using conductive TPUs as sensors embedded in products such as soft robotics, life monitoring of products with structural, and digital twins for live product to user feedback.},

ABSTRACT = {In order to meet the higher requirements of energy-absorbing structures in the lightweight automobile design, the mechanical design and impact energy absorption of porous TPMS structures are studied. Eight kinds of porous TPMS structure elements, Gyroid, Diamond, I-WP, Neovius, Primitive, Fischer-Koch S, F-RD, and PMY, are designed based on Matlab, and the porous structure samples composed of eight elements are printed and molded using SLM. The deformation mechanism, mechanical response, and energy absorption characteristics of different porous TPMS structures are investigated. Gyroid and Primitive elements are selected to fill the internal structure of the energy-absorbing automobile boxes. Traditional thin-walled energy-absorbing boxes served as a control group and were subjected to low-speed impact testing. The results show that the peak load of the energy-absorbing box filled with TPMS porous structures is almost equal to the average load under a 4.4 m/s impact, and the SEA of the energy-absorbing box filled with TPMS porous structures is higher than the traditional thin-walled energy-absorbing box. The problems of excessive peak load and inconsistent load fluctuation of traditional thin-walled energy-absorbing structures are effectively solved by porous TPMS structures with the assurance that the lightweight and energy-absorbing requirements are still met.},

ABSTRACT = {When manufacturing the welded joints of components made of metal–ceramic composites of the Al-Si/SiC type, we encounter significant difficulties. This is related to the presence of a ceramic phase in the aluminium alloy matrix. The interaction between the molten metal matrix and the ceramic particles in the weld pool influences a complex of physicochemical phenomena resulting in, among other things, the structure of the welded joint. This is particularly true of the effect of the distribution of ceramic particles and their influence on the crystallisation process in the weld pool. An important issue is the influence of the reinforcing particles on the susceptibility of the aluminium matrix to both hot and cold cracking. The scope of the research included the development of the chemical composition of an additive material for the TIG welding of aluminium–ceramic composites. This material was made in the form of so-called sticks, cast from alloys containing elements such as magnesium, scandium or zirconium in addition to aluminium. The appropriate composition of the mass content of the individual components was intended to change the crystallisation mode of the weld pool and to obtain strengthening precipitates. The most favourable structure was obtained in the case of a modification of the AlMg5 alloy by the addition of scandium. Minor dispersions of Al3Sc became the nucleation pads of fine grains, which improved the mechanical properties of the alloy. Also, in the case of the addition of zirconium, the crystallisation shifted from dendritic to fine-grain growth. In this paper, the basic strength properties of the developed materials were tested and the most favourable chemical compositions of the filling materials were selected.},

ABSTRACT = {This study documents an investigation of the flow stress properties and microstructural features of Ti6Al4V (ELI) alloy produced using laser powder bed fusion (LPBF). Selected heat treatment strategies were applied to the material to obtain different microstructures. The influence of quasi-static strain rates and temperature on the obtained microstructures of this material and their strain hardening properties are documented in this study. All microstructures of the alloy formed in this study were found to be sensitive to quasi-static strain rates and temperatures, where their flow stresses increased with increasing strain rate and decreased for tests conducted at elevated temperatures. The strain hardening rates of the fine microstructures were found to be high compared to those of coarse microstructures. The strain hardening rates for the various forms of LPBF Ti6Al4V (ELI) examined here were found to diminish with increasing test temperature. Though the deformed surfaces of the built samples were largely dominated by adiabatic shear bands (ASBs), the absence of ASBs was noted for all samples tested at a temperature of 500 °C and an imposed strain of 30%.},

ABSTRACT = {This study presents a novel microfluidic mixer designed, fabricated, and characterized using additive manufacturing technology—stereolithography (SLA)—and harnessing capillarity principles achieved through microstructure patterning. Micromixers are integral components in optimizing mixing and reaction processes within microfluidic systems. The proposed microdevice employs a tank mixing method capable of blending two fluids. With a channel length of up to 6 mm, the process time is remarkably swift at 3 s, and the compact device measures 35 × 40 × 5 mm. The capillarity-driven working flow rates range from 1 μL/s to 37 μL/s, facilitated by channel dimensions varying between 400 μm and 850 μm. The total liquid volume within the device channels is 1652 mL (6176 μL including the supply tanks). The mix index, representing the homogeneity of the two fluids, is approximately 0.55 along the main channel. The manufacturing process, encompassing printing, isopropyl cleaning, and UV (ultraviolet) curing, is completed within 90 min. This microfluidic mixer showcases efficient mixing capabilities, rapid processing, and a compact design, marking it as a promising advancement in microfluidic technology. The new microfluidic mixer is a major step forward in microfluidic technology, providing a cost-effective and flexible solution for various uses. Its compatibility with SLA additive manufacturing allows for quick prototyping and design improvements, making it valuable for research and practical applications in chemistry, biology, and diagnostics. This study highlights the importance of combining advanced manufacturing techniques with basic fluid dynamics to create effective and easy-to-use microfluidic solutions.},
