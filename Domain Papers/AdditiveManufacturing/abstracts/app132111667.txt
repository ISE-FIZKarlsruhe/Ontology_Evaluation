This study aims to investigate the mechanical properties of Functionally Graded Lattice Structures (FGLSs) and to determine their industrial application possibilities through additive manufacturing. For this purpose, lattice structures with uniform and horizontal, vertical and radially graded configurations are designed using auxetic unit cells were fabricated with RGD720 photopolymer resin using Material Jetting. FGLSs are compared with uniform structures in regards with deformation behavior, structural strength and energy absorption. The results showed that the most significant deviation in the strut diameters of the uniform lattice structures was seen in the rotation lattice structure at 8.2%. The lowest deviation was seen in the chiral structure, which deviated by 5.4%. The lowest deviations (between 3.4% and 9%) in FGLSs were obtained in chiral structures. The highest relative density value (0.3049 g/cm3) among all configurations was observed in the vertically graded chiral structure. The lowest relative density value (0.1865 g/cm3) was obtained in uniform re-entrant structures. According to the compression test results, the highest compressive stress (2.61513 MPa) and elastic modulus (84.63192 MPa) were formed in the rotation structure. The maximum energy absorption capacity value (19.381 KJ) and the maximum specific energy absorption value (3649.905 KJ/kg) were obtained in the uniform chiral structure.
