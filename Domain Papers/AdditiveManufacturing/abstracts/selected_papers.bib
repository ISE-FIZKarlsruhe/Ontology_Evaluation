 abstract = {Complex 3D objects with microstructures can be modelled using the function representation (FRep) approach and then manufactured. The task of modelling a geometric object with a sophisticated microstructure based on unit cell repetition is often too computationally expensive for CAD systems. FRep provides efficient tools to solve this problem. However, even for FRep the slicing step required for manufacturing can take a significant amount of time. An accelerated slicing algorithm for FRep 3D objects is proposed in this paper. This algorithm allows the preparation of FRep models for 3D printing without surface generation stage. The spatial index is employed to accelerate the slicing process. A novel compound adaptive criterion and a novel acceleration criterion are proposed to speed up the evaluation of the defining function of an FRep object. The use of these criteria is significantly reducing the computational time for contour construction during the slicing process. The K-d tree and R-tree data structures are used as spatial indexes. The performance of the accelerated slicing algorithm was tested. The contouring time was reduced 100-fold due to using the novel compound adaptive criterion with the novel acceleration criterion.},

 abstract = {Material extrusion additive manufacturing (MEX) is a versatile technology for producing complex specimens of polymers, ceramics and metals. Highly-filled filaments composed of a binder system and a high-volume content of sinterable powders are needed to produce ceramic or metal parts. After shaping the parts via MEX, the binder is removed and the specimens are sintered to obtain a dense part of the sintered filler particles. In this article, the applicability of this additive manufacturing process to produce copper specimens is demonstrated. The particular emphasis is on investigating the production of lightweight specimens that retain mechanical properties without increasing their weight. The effect of infill grades and the cover presence on the debinding process and the flexural properties of the sintered parts was studied. It was observed that covers could provide the same flexural strength with a maximum weight reduction of approximately 23%. However, a cover on specimens with less than 100% infill significantly slows down the debinding process. The results demonstrate the applicability of MEX to produce lightweight copper specimens.},

 abstract = {Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) is the most common 3D printing technology. An object formed through continuous layering until completion is known as an additive process while other processes with different methods are also relevant. In this paper, mechanical properties were analysed using two distinct kinds of printed polyethylene terephthalate (PET) as tensile test specimens. The materials used consist of recycled PET and virgin PET. An assessment of all the forty test pieces of both kinds of PET was undertaken. A comparison of the test samples’ tensile strength values, difference in stress-strain curves, and elongation at break was also carried out. The reasoning behind the fracturing of test pieces that printed with different settings is presented in part by the depiction of the fractured specimens following the tensile test. An optimal route was revealed to be 3D printing with recycled PET, as per the mechanical testing. The hardness of the recycled filament decreased to 6%, while the tensile strength and shear strength increased to 14.7 and 2.8%, respectively. Nonetheless, no changes occurred to the tensile modulus elasticity. Despite notable differences being observed in the results of the recycled PET filament, no substantial differences were found prior or post-recycling in the mechanical properties of the PET filament. In conclusion, the demand for improved recycled 3D printing filament technologies is heightened due to the comparable mechanical features of the specimens of both the 3D printed recycled and virgin materials. With tensile strength figures reaching as high as 43.15MPa at Recycled PET and 3.12% being the greatest elongation at 40% Recycled PET, 100% Recycled is the ideal printing setting.},

At present, the new industrial revolution, Industry 4.0 (I4.0), is taking place in the manufacturing and service markets, allowing more intelligent and automated processes to become a reality through innovative technologies. Not much research was found regarding a holistic application of I4.0′s technological concepts towards CI, which clarifies the potential for improving its effectiveness. This clearly indicates that research is needed regarding this subject. The present publication intends to close this research gap by studying the main I4.0 technological concepts and their possible application towards a typical CI process, establishing the requirements for such an approach. Based on that study, a conceptual approach is proposed (PDCA 4.0), depicting how I4.0 technological concepts should be used for CI enhancement, while aiming to satisfy the identified requirements. By outlining the PDCA 4.0 approach, this paper contributes to increasing the knowledge available regarding the CI realm on how to support the CI shift towards a I4.0 industrial paradigm.},

 abstract = {Nano-manipulation technology, as a kind of “bottom-up” tool, has exhibited an excellent capacity in the field of measurement and fabrication on the nanoscale. Although variety manipulation methods based on probes and microscopes were proposed and widely used due to locating and imaging with high resolution, the development of non-contacted schemes for these methods is still indispensable to operate small objects without damage. However, optical manipulation, especially near-field trapping, is a perfect candidate for establishing brilliant manipulation systems. This paper reports about simulations on the electric and force fields at the tips of metallic probes irradiated by polarized laser outputted coming from a scanning near-field optical microscope probe. Distributions of electric and force field at the tip of a probe have proven that the polarized laser can induce nanoscale evanescent fields with high intensity, which arouse effective force to move nanoparticles. Moreover, schemes with dual probes are also presented and discussed in this paper. Simulation results indicate that different combinations of metallic probes and polarized lasers will provide diverse near-field and corresponding optical force. With the suitable direction of probes and polarization direction, the dual probe exhibits higher trapping force and wider effective wavelength range than a single probe. So, these results give more novel and promising selections for realizing optical manipulation in experiments, so that distinguished multi-functional manipulation systems can be developed.},

 abstract = {Wire arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) is the process by which large, metallic structures are built, layer-by-layer, using a welding arc to melt wire feedstock. In this process, the proper selection of the shielding gas plays a vital role in the achievement of structurally acceptable part geometries and quality surface finishes. In this study, the authors used either a ternary mix (He, Ar and CO2) or a binary mix (Ar and CO2) of shielding gases to deposit wall geometries using an open loop-controlled WAAM system developed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory’s Manufacturing Demonstration Facility. The binary blend produced a wider and shorter geometry, while the ternary blend resulted in a narrower build that was more equivalent to the CAD geometry. The data indicated that the binary blend provided a higher oxygen concentration in the weld as compared to that of the ternary blend. The results imply that the arc characteristics and heat input had a significantly higher impact on the weld penetration than the surface tension effect of surface active elements. This was further verified by developing and applying a high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model of the thermophysical properties of gas mixtures. The results from the model showed that, while the influence of increased oxygen concentration on the surface tension for the binary blend led to a deeper penetration, the ternary blend gave rise to heat flux to the workpiece.},

In an attempt to illuminate and advance in situ quality monitoring and control of workpieces, we present an innovative data-driven method that synchronously collects sensing data and AM process parameters with a low sampling rate during the DED process. The proposed data-driven technique determines the important influences that individual printing parameters and sensing features have on prediction at the inter-layer qualification to perform feature selection. Three Machine Learning (ML) algorithms including Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) are used. During post-production, a threshold is applied to detect low-density occurrences such as porosity sizes and quantities from CT scans that render individual layers acceptable or unacceptable. This information is fed to the ML models for training. Training/testing are completed offline on samples deemed “high-quality” and “low-quality”, utilizing only features recorded from the build process. CNN results show that the classification of acceptable/unacceptable layers can reach between 90% accuracy while training/testing on a “high-quality” sample and dip to 65% accuracy when trained/tested on “low-quality”/“high-quality” (respectively), indicating over-fitting but showing CNN as a promising inter-layer classifier.},

@article{app13031892,
 abstract = {Industrial engineering applications often require manufacturing large components in composite materials to obtain light structures; however, moulds are expensive, especially when manufacturing a limited batch of parts. On the one hand, when traditional approaches are carried out, moulds are milled from large slabs or laminated with composite materials on a model of the part to produce. In this case, the realisation of a mould leads to adding time-consuming operations to the manufacturing process. On the other hand, if a fully additively manufactured approach is chosen, the manufacturing time increases exponentially and does not match the market’s requirements. This research proposes a methodology to improve the production efficiency of large moulds using a hybrid technology by combining additive manufacturing and milling tools. A block of soft material such as foam is milled, and then the printing head of an additive manufacturing machine deposits several layers of plastic material or modelling clay using conformal three-dimensional paths. Finally, the mill can polish the surface, thus obtaining a mould of large dimensions quickly, with reduced cost and without needing trained personnel and handcraft polishing. A software tool has been developed to modify the G-code read by an additive manufacturing machine to obtain material deposition over the soft mould. The authors forced conventional machining instructions to match those of an AM machine. Thus, additive deposition of new material uses 3D conformal trajectories typical of CNC machines. Consequently, communication between two very different instruments using the same language is possible. At first, the code was tested on a modified Fused Filament Fabrication machine whose firmware has been adapted to manage a milling tool and a printing head. Then, the software was tested on a large machine suitable for producing moulds for the large parts typical of marine and aerospace engineering. The research demonstrates that AM technologies can integrate conventional machinery to support the composite materials industry when large parts are required.},

In the random bin-picking process, the wide variety of objects in terms of shape, weight, and surface require complex solutions for the objects to be reliably picked. The challenging part of robotic bin-picking is to determine object pick-points correctly. This paper presents a simulation model based on ADAMS/MATLAB cosimulation for robotic pick-point evaluation for a 2-F robotic gripper. It consists of a mechanical model constructed in ADAMS/View, MATLAB/Simulink force controller, several support functions, and the graphical user interface developed in MATLAB/App Designer. Its functionality can serve three different applications, such as: (1) determining the optimal pick-points of the object due to object complexity, (2) selecting the most appropriate robotic gripper, and (3) improving the existing configuration of the robotic gripper (finger width, depth, shape, stroke width, etc.). Additionally, based on this analysis, new variants of robotic grippers can be proposed. The simulation model has been verified on a selected object on a sample 2-F parallel robotic gripper, showing promising results, where up to 75% of pick-points were correctly determined in the initial testing phase.},

 abstract = {This paper presents one of the final stages in the development of a holistic model of the selective laser melting (SLM) process. The holistic model developed previously allows for modeling of only one stage of SLM, which limits simulations to one cycle with one material. The lattice Boltzmann method is applied for simulation of laser treatment, melting, fluid flow, and solidification. Several models of powder bed generation were developed within the framework of the holistic model and are described in this paper. They were developed on the basis of static and dynamic physical principles with the use of cellular automata, their own code, and the Unity® platform. They employed continuous and discrete particle representation and incorporated a model of powder deposition with particles of atomized or arbitrary shape. The closing of the external simulation circuit, which contains the powder bed generation model, cycle initialization, its realization by the model based on the Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM), and the powder removal model, allows us to finish one simulation cycle of laser treatment and initialize the next, thereby enabling multistage multi-material simulations. The simulation results of the multistage SLM process with the Ti-6Al-V alloy and bioactive glass are presented in this paper. These simulation results confirm the possibility of modeling several SLM stages with two different materials. The holistic model can be used for simulation, design, and optimization of multistage, multi-material SLM processes.},

After removal, the bone–interface implant (BII) and bone–implant contact (BIC) were studied from 3D X-ray computed tomography images. Measured BII of less than 10 µm and BIC of 95% are evidence of excellent osseointegration. Since AM naturally leads to a high-roughness surface finish, the wettability of the implant is increased. The new alloy possesses an increased affinity to the bone. The lattice provides crevices in which the biological tissue can jump in and cling. The combination of these factors is pushing ossification beyond its natural limits. Therefore, the quality and speed of the ossification and osseointegration in/around these Ti–19Nb–14Zr laterally closed lattice implants open the possibility of bone spline key of prostheses.

In particular, the possibility of obtaining 3D cellular models that mimic tissues with precision and reproducibility represents a definitive advance for in vitro studies dealing with the biological mechanisms of cell growth, death and proliferation and is at the basis of the responses of healthy and pathological tissues to drugs and therapies. However, the impact of 3D bioprinting on research is limited by the high costs of professional 3D bioprinters, which represent an obstacle to the widespread access and usability of this technology. In this work, we present a 3D bioprinter that was developed in-house by modifying a low-cost commercial 3D printer by replacing the default extruder used to print plastic filaments with a custom-made syringe extruder that is suitable for printing bioinks. The modifications made to the 3D printer include adjusting the size of the extruder to accommodate a 1 mL syringe and reducing the extruder’s size above the printer. To validate the performance of the home-made bioprinter, some main printing characteristics, the cell vitality and the possibility of bioprinting CAD-designed constructs were benchmarked against a renowned professional 3D bioprinter by RegenHu. According to our findings, our in-house 3D bioprinter was mostly successful in printing a complex glioblastoma tumor model with good performances, and it managed to maintain a cell viability that was comparable to that achieved by a professional bioprinter. This suggests that an accessible open-source 3D bioprinter could be a viable option for research and development (R&D) laboratories interested in pre-commercial 3D bioprinting advancements.},

FGLSs are compared with uniform structures in regards with deformation behavior, structural strength and energy absorption. The results showed that the most significant deviation in the strut diameters of the uniform lattice structures was seen in the rotation lattice structure at 8.2%. The lowest deviation was seen in the chiral structure, which deviated by 5.4%. The lowest deviations (between 3.4% and 9%) in FGLSs were obtained in chiral structures. The highest relative density value (0.3049 g/cm3) among all configurations was observed in the vertically graded chiral structure. The lowest relative density value (0.1865 g/cm3) was obtained in uniform re-entrant structures.

 abstract = {The process of atomizing aluminum alloy powder using a rotating disk was studied by numerical simulation and experimental verification. The motion characteristics of the molten metal thin liquid film and the evolution law of atomization into droplets were systematically studied with different disk shapes and speeds. The results showed that the slippage of the liquid film on the surface of the spherical disk was smaller, the liquid film spread more evenly, and the velocity distribution was more uniform. Under the same working condition, the boundary diameter of the continuous liquid film on the spherical disk was 21–29% larger, and the maximum liquid film velocity increased by approximately 19%. In other words, the liquid film obtained more energy at the same rotational speed, the energy utilization rate was higher, and the liquid filaments produced by the splitting region of the disk surface were finer and greater in number. The data showed that the average thickness of the liquid film on the surfaces of different disk shapes was more affected by the speed of the flat disk, and the thickness on the spherical disk was relatively stable and uniform, but the difference in thickness between the two disk shapes decreased from 4.2 μm to 0.3 μm when the speed increased from 10,000 rpm to 60,000 rpm. In particular, the influence of the disk shape on the liquid film thickness became smaller when the speed increased to a certain range. At the same time, the characteristics of the liquid film during the spreading movement of molten metal on the disk and the mechanisms of the primary and secondary breakage of the liquid film were obtained through this simulation study.},

 abstract = {Silicon nanotubes (SiNTs) have been researched as a promising anode material to replace graphite in next-generation lithium ion batteries. Chemical etching synthesis of SiNTs is a simple, controllable and scalable process for SiNT fabrication, but the environmental emissions are of grave concern. In this paper, the process emissions from chemical etching synthesis of SiNTs as anode for lithium ion batteries is studied through experimental techniques, considering the categories of aqueous wastes, gaseous emissions, aqueous nano-particle emissions, and gaseous aerosol emissions. The synthesized SiNTs are measured at 10 μm length and 1–2.2 μm diameter, and can maintain a specific capacity of over 800 mAh/g after 100 cycles in battery testing. In aqueous waste, the chemical compositions of all elements participating in the chemical etching are experimentally determined, with AgNO3 and Co(NO3)2 identified as the major pollutants. The only gaseous emission generated from the chemical etching synthesis process is H2, with 0.0088 ± 0.0002 mol H2 generated to produce 1.0 mg SiNTs. The aqueous nanoparticle sizes are found to be between 250 nm and 1540 nm. A large number of aerosol nanoparticle emissions of up to 2.96 × 107 particles/cm3 are detected through in situ experimental measurement.},
