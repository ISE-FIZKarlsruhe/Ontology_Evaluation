The process of atomizing aluminum alloy powder using a rotating disk was studied by numerical simulation and experimental verification. The motion characteristics of the molten metal thin liquid film and the evolution law of atomization into droplets were systematically studied with different disk shapes and speeds. The results showed that the slippage of the liquid film on the surface of the spherical disk was smaller, the liquid film spread more evenly, and the velocity distribution was more uniform. Under the same working condition, the boundary diameter of the continuous liquid film on the spherical disk was 21–29% larger, and the maximum liquid film velocity increased by approximately 19%. In other words, the liquid film obtained more energy at the same rotational speed, the energy utilization rate was higher, and the liquid filaments produced by the splitting region of the disk surface were finer and greater in number. The data showed that the average thickness of the liquid film on the surfaces of different disk shapes was more affected by the speed of the flat disk, and the thickness on the spherical disk was relatively stable and uniform, but the difference in thickness between the two disk shapes decreased from 4.2 μm to 0.3 μm when the speed increased from 10,000 rpm to 60,000 rpm. In particular, the influence of the disk shape on the liquid film thickness became smaller when the speed increased to a certain range. At the same time, the characteristics of the liquid film during the spreading movement of molten metal on the disk and the mechanisms of the primary and secondary breakage of the liquid film were obtained through this simulation study.
