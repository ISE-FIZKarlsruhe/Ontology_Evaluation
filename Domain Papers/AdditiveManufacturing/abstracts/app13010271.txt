Due to the augmented complexity of the factory on the one hand and the increased availability of information on the other hand, nowadays it is possible to design models of production lines able to consider the state of the health of the production system. Such models must combine both the deterministic and the stochastic behaviours of a system, with the former accounting for the mechanics and physics of the industrial process and the latter for randomness, including reliability of the production systems and the unpredictability of the maintenance and of the manufacturing lines. This study proposes the application of a Hybrid Dependability Modelling based on Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the performances of a repairable production line modelled with a queueing G/G/1 system. The model proposed is characterized by random interarrival and service times and by the wearing and dynamic aging phenomena of the machine tools that depend on the working and operating conditions.
