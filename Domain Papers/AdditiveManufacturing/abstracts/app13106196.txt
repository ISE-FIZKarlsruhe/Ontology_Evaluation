This paper presents one of the final stages in the development of a holistic model of the selective laser melting (SLM) process. The holistic model developed previously allows for modeling of only one stage of SLM, which limits simulations to one cycle with one material. The lattice Boltzmann method is applied for simulation of laser treatment, melting, fluid flow, and solidification. Several models of powder bed generation were developed within the framework of the holistic model and are described in this paper. They were developed on the basis of static and dynamic physical principles with the use of cellular automata, their own code, and the UnityÂ® platform. They employed continuous and discrete particle representation and incorporated a model of powder deposition with particles of atomized or arbitrary shape. The closing of the external simulation circuit, which contains the powder bed generation model, cycle initialization, its realization by the model based on the Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM), and the powder removal model, allows us to finish one simulation cycle of laser treatment and initialize the next, thereby enabling multistage multi-material simulations. The simulation results of the multistage SLM process with the Ti-6Al-V alloy and bioactive glass are presented in this paper. These simulation results confirm the possibility of modeling several SLM stages with two different materials. The holistic model can be used for simulation, design, and optimization of multistage, multi-material SLM processes.
