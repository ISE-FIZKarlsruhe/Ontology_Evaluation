The definition of air resistance is nonuniform when analyzing the bearing capacity, stiffness, and stability of an orifice throttling aerostatic restrictor. In this study, a capillary tube similar to the inlet section of an aerostatic restrictor is used as the research object, and the Bernoulli equation under adiabatic conditions is established. Through an experiment, the pressure and temperature of the capillary tube inlet and outlet and the flow through the capillary tube are measured. Based on the air resistance definition, the empirical formula of the coefficient k is obtained, and the theoretical air resistance of the capillary path is calculated. The relative error between the theoretical air resistance and experimental air resistance is kept within 10%. The comparison results verify the accuracy of the air resistance theory and provide a basis for the subsequent establishment of a universal definition of air resistance. Subsequently, air resistance can be used to design aerostatic bearings and help improve their characteristics.
