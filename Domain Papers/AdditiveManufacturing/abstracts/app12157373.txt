A novel forming method of enhanced adhesion-efficient demolding integration is proposed to solve the problems of weak adhesion between the initial forming layer and the printing platform as well as the excessive stripping force at the bottom of the liquid tank when the printing platform rises. Therefore, a digital light processing (DLP) 3D printing forming device equipped with a porous replaceable printing platform and a swing mechanism for the liquid tank is manufactured and verified by experiments. The experimental results show that the porous printing platform can enhance the adhesion between the initial forming layer and the printing platform and improve the demolding efficiency of the forming device. In addition, the pull-out design of the printing platform plate reduces the maintenance cost of the forming device. Therefore, the device has a good application prospect.
