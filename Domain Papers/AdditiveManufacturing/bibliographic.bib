ABSTRACT = {The laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) technology was adapted for use with non-spherical low-cost water-atomized iron powders. A simplified numerical and experimental modeling approach was applied to determine—in a first approximation—the operation window for the selected powder in terms of laser power, scanning speed, hatching space, and layer thickness. The operation window, delimited by a build rate ranging from 4 to 25 cm3/h, and a volumetric energy density ranging from 50 to 190 J/mm3, was subsequently optimized to improve the density, the mechanical properties, and the surface roughness of the manufactured specimens. Standard L-PBF-built specimens were subjected to microstructural (porosity, grain size) and metrological (accuracy, shrinkage, minimum wall thickness, surface roughness) analyses and mechanical testing (three-point bending and tensile tests). The results of the microstructural, metrological and mechanical characterizations of the L-PBF-built specimens subjected to stress relieve annealing and hot isostatic pressing were then compared with those obtained with conventional pressing-sintering technology. Finally, by using an energy density of 70 J/mm3 and a build rate of 9 cm3/h, it was possible to manufacture 99.8%-dense specimens with an ultimate strength of 330 MPa and an elongation to failure of 30%, despite the relatively poor circularity of the powder used.},

ABSTRACT = {Titanium aluminide (TiAl) turbine blades produced by isothermal forging have recently been implemented in the low-pressure part of commercial aircraft jet engines. However, the slow speed of isothermal forging, costly molybdenum-based dies and the required protective forging atmosphere makes the process rather expensive. Currently, industrial forging is done by closed-die isothermal forging processes with stationary dies. Idle time occurs when single parts are inserted and extracted from the dies. As an interesting alternative for forging small parts, a new set-up is devised and explored in this work, i.e., batch processing. Using a die set which allow for off-line preassembly and preheating, multiple parts can be forged in one stroke. The design of the batch process was based on a new material model, which was implemented into a finite element system to identify the forging parameters. The setup of the press transport system for batch processing, as well as the results of the simulations and forging experiments are presented. A cost comparison between the new process and conventional forging with stationary dies concludes that for smaller parts such as compressor blades, batch processing offers advantages regarding productivity and cost.},

ABSTRACT = {The concept of Zener–Hollomon (Z) based Forming Limit Surface (Z-FLS)—which has minor strain, major strain, and ln(Z) as its three axes—was initially proposed in a previous study. In the Z-FLS diagram, strain rate and temperature effects on the major limit strain are reflected by ln(Z). In the current study, the concept of Z-FLS is revisited to provide a practical approach to construct Z-FLS. A Z-FLS then is constructed for magnesium alloy AZ31B sheet material using available experimental forming limit curves. The constructed Z-FLS is used to identify fracture in a non-isothermal warm cup forming process, which was modeled as a coupled thermo-mechanical process. Based on the Z-FLS, the determined limiting draw ratio (LDR) matches well with the published experimental results.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper describes an error separation method for a precision measurement of the run-out of a microdrill bit by using a measurement system consisting of a concentricity gauge and a laser scan micrometer (LSM). The proposed error separation method can achieve a sub-micrometric measurement accuracy of the run-out of the microdrill bit without the requirement of ultra-precision rotary drive devices. In the measurement, the spindle error motion of the concentricity gauge is firstly measured by using the LSM and a small-diameter artifact, instead of the conventionally used displacement probes and large-diameter artifact, in order to determine the fine position of the concentricity gauge when the spindle error motion is at its minimum. The microdrill bit is rotated at the fine position for the measurement of the run-out, so that the influence of the spindle error motion can thus be reduced, which could not be previously realized by commercial measurement systems. Experiments were carried out to verify the feasibility of the proposed error separation method for the measurement of the run-out of the microdrill bit. The measurement results and the measurement uncertainty confirmed that the proposed method is reliable for the run-out measurement with sub-micrometric accuracy.},

ABSTRACT = {Polymer optics are widely used in various applications, replacing traditional glass lenses. The ability to create free-form and micro-structured optics, as well as fast replication, gives them major advantages over traditional glass lenses. However, the fabrication of complex optical components requires full process control and understanding of influencing factors on the quality of the polymer optical parts. In this work, a curved diffractive optical element (DOE) is fabricated using injection compression molding. Different gate designs were evaluated and the movement of the compression stamper was optimized to obtain good filling behavior. The process stability was analyzed and improved by controlling the melt temperature precisely. Finally, the molding parameters were optimized, focusing on the mold temperature, melt temperature and compression force. Curved diffractive optical elements were replicated with feature sizes of 1.6 μm. The experiments showed that all aspects of the molding process have to be controlled perfectly to produce complex polymer optics. High mold temperatures and compression force are necessary to replicate micro-structured features. The work presents a broad investigation and description of the fabrication process and their influences.},

ABSTRACT = {A precise characterization of material behavior is necessary to identify yield criteria or hardening laws for an accurate numerical design of sheet metal forming processes. Current models like Yld2000-2d or Hill’48 do not consider the plane strain state, though this condition is primary cause of failure in deep drawing. It is anticipated that an improved yield locus contour which considers the stress under plane strain conditions leads to better results in numerical simulations of a deep drawing process. Within this contribution, a new experimental setup to characterize both principal stress components under plane strain as additional input data for material modelling is presented. Therefore, hydraulic bulge tests are carried out with a novel elliptical die, which implements a plane strain condition. Moreover, the improvement of the material model is investigated exemplarily for the three sheet metal alloys DC06, DP600 and AA5182. The resulting material parameters are used to identify the yield locus for plane strain by varying the yield locus exponent of Yld2000-2d. The results prove that considering plane strain yield locus results in a better sheet thickness distribution in comparison to conventional modelling of the deep drawing process.},

ABSTRACT = {Machining grooves and ridges (peaks) into the surface of wooden deckboards reduces undesirable checking that develops when “profiled” boards are exposed to the weather. We aim to develop improved profiles for amabilis fir decking to reduce its susceptibility to checking, and also to examine whether profiling influences distortion (cupping) of deckboards. We systematically varied radii of grooves and peaks, and the heights and widths of peaks in profiled deckboards, exposed them to the weather, and measured checking and cupping of boards. Profiling significantly reduced the numbers and sizes of checks in amabilis fir deckboards, but increased cupping. Profiles with narrow grooves and tall peaks were generally better at restricting checking than profiles with wide grooves and shorter peaks. Our results suggest that one of the profiles we tested would be better at restricting checking than profiles used previously to manufacture profiled decking from amabilis fir. We conclude that the surface checking of profiled amabilis fir decking can be significantly reduced by altering the geometry of surface profiles. In principal, the same approach could be used with other softwood species that have potential to capture a share of the large and important market for wood decking.},

ABSTRACT = {In this study, a precision motion stage, whose design utilizes a single shaft supported from the bottom by an air bearing and voice coil actuators in complementary double configuration, is evaluated for its dynamic properties, motion accuracy, and potential machining force response, through modal testing, laser interferometric metrology, and spectral analysis, respectively. Modal testing is carried out using two independent methods, which are both based on impact hammer testing. Results are compared with each other and with the predicted natural frequencies based on design calculations. Laser interferometry has been used with varying optics to measure the geometric errors of motion. Laser interferometry results are merged with measured servo errors, estimated thermal errors, and the predicted dynamic response to machining forces, to compile the error budget. Overall accuracy of the stage is calculated as peak-to-valley 5.7 μm with a 2.3 μm non-repeatable part. The accuracy measured is in line with design calculations which incorporated the accuracy grade of the encoder scale and the dimensional tolerances of structural components. The source of the non-repeatable errors remains mostly equivocal, as they fall in the range of random errors of measurement in laser interferometry like alterations of the laser wavelength due to air turbulence.},

ABSTRACT = {The question, how certain surface layer properties (for example, hardness or roughness) can be specifically influenced in different manufacturing processes, is of great economic interest. A prerequisite for the investigation of the formation of surface layer properties is the metrological assessment of the material stresses during processing. Up to now, no commercial in-process measuring system exists, which is able to determine material stresses in the form of mechanical strains in high-dynamic manufacturing processes with sufficient accuracy. A detailed analysis of the resolution limits shows that speckle photography enables deformation measurements with a resolution in the single-digit nanometer range. Thus, speckle photography basically offers the potential to measure material stresses during processing. Using the example of single-tooth milling, the applicability of speckle photography for in-process stress measurements is demonstrated. Even in such highly dynamic manufacturing processes with cutting speeds up to 10 m/s, the absolute measurement uncertainty of the strain is less than 0.05%. This is more than one order of magnitude lower than the occurring maximal strain. Therefore, speckle photography is suitable for characterizing the dynamic stresses and the material deformations in manufacturing processes.},

ABSTRACT = {Transparent, brittle materials, like glass, are used in various applications due to their advantages of mechanical and optical properties. However, their hard and brittle nature causes significant challenges to researchers when they design and test a new machining process. In order to optimize this time-consuming process, discrete element method (DEM) is applied to simulate the cutting process of soda-lime glass in this study. The first step is to create a synthetic material that behaves like soda-lime glass. Then, the macroproperties are calibrated by adjusting the microparameters of the DEM model to match the mechanical properties of the real soda-lime glass. Finally, orthogonal machining simulations are conducted and model validation are conducted by comparing the predicted cutting forces with those from the orthogonal cutting experiments.},

ABSTRACT = {Silicon nanotubes (SiNTs) have been researched as a promising anode material to replace graphite in next-generation lithium ion batteries. Chemical etching synthesis of SiNTs is a simple, controllable and scalable process for SiNT fabrication, but the environmental emissions are of grave concern. In this paper, the process emissions from chemical etching synthesis of SiNTs as anode for lithium ion batteries is studied through experimental techniques, considering the categories of aqueous wastes, gaseous emissions, aqueous nano-particle emissions, and gaseous aerosol emissions. The synthesized SiNTs are measured at 10 μm length and 1–2.2 μm diameter, and can maintain a specific capacity of over 800 mAh/g after 100 cycles in battery testing. In aqueous waste, the chemical compositions of all elements participating in the chemical etching are experimentally determined, with AgNO3 and Co(NO3)2 identified as the major pollutants. The only gaseous emission generated from the chemical etching synthesis process is H2, with 0.0088 ± 0.0002 mol H2 generated to produce 1.0 mg SiNTs. The aqueous nanoparticle sizes are found to be between 250 nm and 1540 nm. A large number of aerosol nanoparticle emissions of up to 2.96 × 107 particles/cm3 are detected through in situ experimental measurement.},

ABSTRACT = {One of the most essential components of the fused deposition modeling (FDM) additive manufacturing (AM) process is the build plate, the surface upon which the part is constructed. These are typically made from aluminum or glass, but there are clear disadvantages to both and restrictions on which materials can be processed on them successfully. This study examined the suitability of heated aluminum-polycarbonate (AL-PC) composite print beds for FDM, looking particularly at the mechanical properties, thermal behavior, deformation behavior, bonding strength with deposited material, printing quality, and range of material usability. Theoretical examination and physical experiments were performed for each of these areas; the results were compared to similar experiments done using heated aluminum and aluminum-glass print beds. Ten distinct materials (ABS, PLA, PET, HIPS, PC, TPU, PVA, nylon, metal PLA, and carbon-fiber PLA) were tested for printing performance. The use of a heated AL-PC print bed was found to be a practical option for most of the materials, particularly ABS and TPU, which are often challenging to process using traditional print bed types. Generally, the results were found to be equivalent to or superior to tempered glass and superior to standard aluminum build plates in terms of printing capability.},

ABSTRACT = {Lightweight design is gaining in importance throughout the engineering sector, and with it, workpieces are becoming increasingly complex. Particularly, thin-walled parts require highly accurate and efficient machining strategies. Such low-rigidity structures usually undergo significant deformations during peripheral milling operations, thus suffering surface errors and a violation of tolerance specifications. This article introduces a general approach to mitigating surface errors during the peripheral milling of thin-walled aluminum workpieces. It incorporates an analytical approach to predicting surface-error characteristics based on geometrical quantities and process parameters, which is presented in detail. Milling experiments, including geometrical measurements of the samples, have been performed to verify the approach. The approach allows for a pre-selection of parameter sets that result in surface errors that can be compensated with minimal effort. Additionally, the introduced model offers a simple criterion to assess potential error mitigation by applying the respective tool-path adjustments. In doing so, the amount of costly numerical simulations or experiments is significantly reduced.},

The use of a frequency-modulating interferometer and photosensitive arrays in combination with a Gaussian laser beam allows for fast and automated online measurements of the axes’ motion errors and thermal conditions with comparable accuracy, lower cost, and smaller dimensions as compared to state-of-the-art optical measuring instruments for offline machine tool calibration. The development is tested through simulation of the sensor setup based on raytracing and Monte-Carlo techniques.},

The diamond tools being used exhibit customized rectangular tool geometry with a tool width of 10–20 μm.

ABSTRACT = {Due to their high ductility, high durability, and excellent corrosion resistance, stainless steels are attractive materials for a variety of applications. However, high work hardening, low thermal conductivity, and high built-up edge (BUE) formation make these materials difficult to machine. Rapid tool wear and high cutting forces are the common problems encountered while machining these materials. In the present work, the application of Taguchi optimization methodology has been used to optimize the cutting parameters of the drilling process for machining two stainless steels: austenitic AISI 304 and duplex AISI 2205 under dry conditions. The machining parameters which were chosen to be evaluated in this study are the tool material, cutting speed, and feed rate, while, the response factors to be measured are the tool life (T), cutting force (Fc), and specific cutting energy (ks). Additionally, empirical models were created for predicting the T, Fc and ks using linear regression analysis. The results of this study show that AISI 2205 stainless steel has a shorter tool life, a higher cutting force, and a higher specific cutting energy than AISI 304 stainless steel. In addition, the Taguchi method determined that A3B1C1 and A3B3C1 (A3 = TiN-coated twist drill, B1 = 13 m/min, B3 = 34 m/min, C1 = 0.12 mm/rev) are the optimized combination of levels for the best tool life and the lowest cutting force, respectively. Meanwhile, the optimized combination of levels for all three control factors from the analysis, which provides the lowest specific cutting energy, was found to be A3B1C3 (A3 = TiN-coated twist drill, B1 = 13 m/min, C3 = 0.32 mm/rev) for both stainless steels.},

ABSTRACT = {Probes for CNC machine tools, as every measurement device, have accuracy limited by random errors and by systematic errors. Random errors of these probes are described by a parameter called unidirectional repeatability. Manufacturers of probes for CNC machine tools usually specify only this parameter, while parameters describing systematic errors of the probes, such as pre-travel variation or triggering radius variation, are used rarely. Systematic errors of the probes, linked to the differences in pre-travel values for different measurement directions, can be corrected or compensated, but it is not a widely used procedure. In this paper, the share of systematic errors and random errors in total error of exemplary probes are determined. In the case of simple, kinematic probes, systematic errors are much greater than random errors, so compensation would significantly reduce the probing error. Moreover, it shows that in the case of kinematic probes commonly specified unidirectional repeatability is significantly better than 2D performance. However, in the case of more precise strain-gauge probe systematic errors are of the same order as random errors, which means that errors correction or compensation, in this case, would not yield any significant benefits.},

ABSTRACT = {The metal 3-D printing market is currently dominated by high-end applications, which make it inaccessible for small and medium enterprises, fab labs, and individual makers who are interested in the ability to prototype and additively manufacture final products in metal. Recent progress led to low-cost open-source metal 3-D printers using a gas metal arc welding (GMAW)-based print head. This reduced the cost of metal 3-D printers into the range of desktop prosumer polymer 3-D printers. Consequent research established good material properties of metal 3-D printed parts with readily-available weld filler wire, reusable substrates, thermal and stress properties, toolpath planning, bead-width control, mechanical properties, and support for overhangs. These previous works showed that GMAW-based metal 3-D printing has a good adhesion between layers and is not porous inside the printed parts, but they did not proceed far enough to demonstrate applications. In this study, the utility of the GMAW approach to 3-D printing is investigated using a low-cost open-source metal 3-D printer and a converted Computer Numerical Control router machine to make useful parts over a range of applications including: fixing an existing part by adding a 3-D metal feature, creating a product using the substrate as part of the component, 3-D printing in high resolution of useful objects, near net objects, and making an integrated product using a combination of steel and polymer 3-D printing. The results show that GMAW-based 3-D printing is capable of distributed manufacturing of useful products for a wide variety of applications for sustainable development.},

ABSTRACT = {In a production of filigree and complex geometries, different NC-controlled processes such as laser cutting, EDM milling, and micromachining require a constant feed rate to ensure high-quality manufacturing results. Due to the technically limited acceleration ability of the machine tool axes, the nominal feed cannot always be achieved. This in particular is the case when the machine tool has to perform a significant change of direction in corners. In this paper, the impact of too low feed rates on the process of precise micromilling of a hardened high-speed steel AISI (M3:2) 63 ± 1 HRC) is discussed. An unattained feed rate leads to a ploughing dominated process with a high burr formation resulting in a huge potential loss of micromilling processes. Furthermore, a simulation approach is presented which allows the prediction of the actually achieved feed rate. The developed machine model provides a reliable method to identify critical areas in the entire NC program.},

ABSTRACT = {During the process of grind-hardening, the dissipated heat from the process is utilized for a surface layer hardening of machined components made of steel. A martensitic phase transformation occurs within the affected subsurface regions and compressive residual stresses are induced. However, the layout of a grind-hardening process for given hardness results (material modification) is very difficult. Thus, a series of extensive experimental tests is required. To reduce this experimental effort, the newly developed concept of Process Signatures is used to describe the material modifications based on the thermal load appearing during the grind-hardening process. Based on an analytical calculation of the temperature fields during the grind-hardening process (surface- and external-cylindrical-grind-hardening), the internal thermal load was characterized by the maximum contact zone temperature and the maximum temperature gradient at the surface and was correlated with the process quantities (heat flux to the workpiece and the contact time). Metallographic investigations were used to analyze the surface hardening depth and the hardness change at the surface, which were correlated with the quantities describing the internal material loads. The results show that the surface hardening depth was mainly governed by the maximum contact zone temperature and the maximum temperature gradient at the surface, whereas the hardness change at the surface was influenced additionally by the quenching time.},

ABSTRACT = {An S-shaped machining test is proposed for the ISO 10791-7 standard to verify the performance of five-axis machining centers. However, investigation of the factor that has the most influence on the geometrical accuracy of finished S-shaped workpieces has not been undertaken. Determination of the influence of NC program tolerance and geometric errors concerning the rotary axes on the accuracy of the finished S-shaped workpiece forms the main objective of the study. Actual cutting experiments as well as simulations were performed during the proposed investigation. Our results clarify that NC-program tolerance has a significant influence on the end quality of the machined surface. Although geometric errors pertaining to rotary axes also have a significant influence on machined-surface quality, it is difficult to evaluate the influence of each individual error, because all geometric errors make glitches at the same point on the machined surface. The proposed S-shaped machining test can be used to provide a complete demonstration of available machining techniques.},

ABSTRACT = {Due to the constant need for better functionalized surfaces or smaller, function integrated components, precise and efficient manufacturing processes have to be established. Micro milling with micro end mills is one of the most promising processes for this task as it combines a high geometric flexibility in a wide range of machinable materials with low set-up costs. A downside of this process is the wear of the micro end mills. Due to size effects and the relatively low cutting speed, the cutting edge is especially subjected to massive abrasive wear. One possibility to minimize this wear is coating of micro end mills. This research paper describes the performance of eight different hard coatings for micro end mills with a diameter <40 µm and discusses some properties for the best performing coating type. With this research, it is therefore possible to boost the possibilities of micro milling for the manufacture of next generation products.},

ABSTRACT = {To be competitive in a manufacturing environment by providing optimal performance in terms of cost-effectiveness and swiftness of system changes, there is a need for flexible production systems based on a well-defined strategy. Companies are steadily looking for methodology to evaluate, improve and update the performance of manufacturing systems for processing operations. Implementation of an adequate strategy for these systems’ flexibility requires a deep understanding of the intricate interactions between the machining process parameters and the manufacturing system’s operational parameters. This paper proposes a framework/generic model for one of the most common metal cutting operations—the boring process of an engine block machining system. A system dynamics modelling approach is presented for modelling the structure of machining system parameters of the boring process, key performance parameters and their intrinsic relationships. The model is based on a case study performed in a company manufacturing engine blocks for heavy vehicles. The approach could allow for performance evaluation of an engine block manufacturing system condition. The presented model enables a basis for other similar processes and industries producing discrete parts.},

ABSTRACT = {Additive manufacturing (AM) of soft materials has a wide variety of applications, such as customized or wearable devices. Silicone is one popular material for these applications given its favorable material properties. However, AM of silicone parts with overhang structures remains challenging due to the soft nature of the material. Overhang structures are the areas where there is no underlying structure. Typically, a support material is used and built in the underlying space so that the overhang structures can be built upon it. Currently, there is no support structure that has been used for AM of silicone. The goal of this study is to develop an AM process to fabricate silicone parts with overhang structures. We first identified and confirmed poly-vinyl alcohol (PVA), a water-soluble material, as a suitable support material for silicone by evaluating the adhesion strength between silicone and PVA. Process parameters for the support material, including critical overhang angle and minimum infill density for the support material, are identified. However, overhang angle alone is not the only determining factor for support material. As silicone is a soft material, it deflects due to its own weight when the height of the overhang structure increases. A finite element model is developed to estimate the critical overhang height paired with different overhang angles to determine whether the use of support material is needed. Finally, parts with overhang structures are printed to demonstrate the capability of the developed process.},

ABSTRACT = {The fabrication of engineered lattice structures has recently gained momentum due to the development of novel additive manufacturing techniques. Interest in lattice structures resides not only in the possibility of obtaining efficient lightweight materials, but also in the functionality of pre-designed architectured structures for specific applications, such as biomimetic implants, chemical catalyzers, and heat transfer devices. The mechanical behaviour of lattice structures depends not only the composition of the base material, but also on the type and size of the unit cells, as well as on the material microstructure resulting from a specific fabrication procedure. The present work focuses on the static and fatigue behavior of diamond cell lattice structures fabricated from an AlSiMg alloy by laser powder bed fusion technology. In particular, the specimens were fabricated with three different orientations of lattice cells—[001], [011], [111]—and subjected to static tensile testing and force-controlled pull–pull fatigue testing up to 1 × 107 cycles. In parallel, the mechanical behavior of dense tensile plain and notched specimens was also studied and compared to that of their lattice counterparts. Results showed a significant effect of the cell orientation on the fatigue lives: specimens oriented at [001] were ~30% more fatigue-resistant than specimens oriented at [011] and [111].},

ABSTRACT = {The correct choice of process parameters is important in predicting the cut surface and obtaining a fully-fine sheared surface in the fine blanking process. The researchers used the value of the critical fracture criterion obtained by long duration experiments to predict the conditions of cut surfaces in the fine blanking process. In this study, the clearance-dependent critical ductile fracture criteria obtained by the Cockcroft-Latham and Oyane criteria were used to reduce the time and cost of experiments to obtain the value of the critical fracture criterion. The Finite Element Method (FEM) was applied to fine blanking processes to study the influences of process parameters such as the initial compression, the punch and die corner radii and the shape and size of the V-ring indenter on the length of the sheared surface. The effects of stress triaxiality and punch diameters on the cut surface produced by the fine blanking process are also discussed. The verified process parameters and tool geometry for obtaining a fully-fine sheared SPCC surface are described. The results showed that the accurate and stable prediction of ductile fracture initiation can be achieved using the Oyane criterion.},

ABSTRACT = {High-speed machining (HSM) is used in industry to improve the productivity and quality of the cutting operations. In this investigation, pure alumina ceramics with the addition of ZrO2, and mixed alumina (Al2O3 + TiC) tools were used in the dry hard turning of AISI 4340 (52 HRC) at different high cutting speeds of 150, 250, 700 and 1000 m/min. It was observed that at cutting speeds of 150 and 250 m/min, pure alumina ceramic tools had better wear resistance than mixed alumina ones. However, upon increasing the cutting speed from 700 to 1000 m/min, mixed alumina ceramic tools outperformed pure ceramic ones. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were used to investigate the worn cutting edges and analyze the obtained results. It was found that the tribo-films formed at the cutting zone during machining affected the wear resistances of the tools and influenced the coefficient of friction at the tool-chip interface. These observations were confirmed by the chip compression ratio results at different cutting conditions. Raising cutting speed to 1000 m/min corresponded to a remarkable decrease in cutting force components in the dry hard turning of AISI 4340 steel.},

ABSTRACT = {Smart ceramic materials are next generation materials with the inherent intelligence to adapt to change in the external environment. These materials are destined to play an essential role in several critical engineering applications. Machining these materials using traditional machining processes is a challenge. The laser beam micromachining (LBMM) process has the potential to machine such smart materials. However, laser machining when performed in air induces high thermal stress on the surface, often leading to crack formation, recast and re-deposition of ablated material, and large heat-affected zones (HAZ). Performing laser beam machining in the presence of a liquid medium could potentially resolve these issues. This research investigates the possibility of using a Liquid Assisted—Laser Beam Micromachining (LA-LBMM) process for micromachining smart ceramic materials. Experimental studies are performed to compare the machining quality of laser beam machining process in air and in a liquid medium. The study reveals that the presence of liquid medium helps in controlling the heat-affected zone and the taper angle of the cavity drilled, thereby enhancing the machining quality. Analytical modeling is developed for the prediction of HAZ and cavity diameter both in air and underwater conditions, and the model is capable of predicting the experimental results to within 10% error.},

ABSTRACT = {There has been a substantial increase in the use and development of plastics over the last century. However, due to ever-diminishing petroleum feedstocks and growing concern for the environment, there has been a rise in the use of eco-friendly polymers affording similar properties to that of their depleting counterparts. Poly(ε-caprolactone) is one such polymer. This present study investigates the possibility of developing a degradable nanocomposite, suitable for fused filament fabrication, utilizing hot melt extrusion technology to blend poly(ε-caprolactone), poly(ethylene) oxide and the nanoclay halloysite at loadings of two and six weight percent. The extruded blends were characterized using common polymer testing techniques. The addition of poly(ε-caprolactone) to the poly(ethylene) oxide matrix provided a plasticizing effect which was apparent with the melt flow index and melting point of the blends reducing with an increase in poly(ε-caprolactone) content. Upon reinforcing the matrix with halloysite, there was a significant improvement in mechanical properties. The addition of halloysite significantly increased Young’s modulus 11% and 25% when the loading was two and six percent respectively. Furthermore, it was also possible to produce a filament with the desired properties, diameter 1.75 mm, for fused filament fabrication, with subsequent studies required to evaluate their printability.},

ABSTRACT = {In this work, the microstructure, texture, phases, and microhardness of 45° printed (with respect to the build direction) homogenized, and hot isostatically pressed (HIP) cylindrical IN718 specimens are investigated. Phase morphology, grain size, microhardness, and crystallographic texture at the bottom of each specimen differ from those of the top due to changes in cooling rate. High cooling rates during the printing process generated a columnar grain structure parallel to the building direction in the as-printed condition with a texture transition from (001) orientation at the bottom of the specimen to (111) orientation towards the specimen top based on EBSD analysis. A mixed columnar and equiaxed grain structure associated with about a 15% reduction in texture is achieved after homogenization treatment. HIP treatment caused significant grain coarsening, and engendered equiaxed grains with an average diameter of 154.8 µm. These treatments promoted the growth of δ-phase (Ni3Nb) and MC-type brittle (Ti, Nb)C carbides at grain boundaries. Laves phase (Fe2Nb) was also observed in the as-printed and homogenized specimens. Ostwald ripening of (Ti, Nb)C carbides caused excessive grain growth at the bottom of the HIPed IN718 specimens, while smaller grains were observed at their top. Microhardness in the as-fabricated specimens was 236.9 HV and increased in the homogenized specimens by 19.3% to 282.6 HV due to more even distribution of secondary precipitates, and the nucleation of smaller grains. A 36.1% reduction in microhardness to 180.5 HV was found in the HIPed condition due to   γ ″ phase dissolution and differences in grain morphology.},

ABSTRACT = {The introduction of Additive Manufacturing (AM) is changing the way in which components and machines can be designed and manufactured. Within this context, designers are taking advantage of the possibilities of producing parts via the addition of material, defining strategies, and exploring alternative design or optimization solutions (i.e., nonviable using subtractive technologies) of critical parts (e.g., gears and shafts). However, a safe and effective design requires specific resistance data that, due to the intrinsic modernity of additive technologies, are not always present in the literature. This paper presents the results of an experimental campaign performed on gear-samples made by 17-4 PH and produced via Laser Powder Bed Fusion (PBF-LB/M). The tests were executed using the Single Tooth Bending Fatigue (STBF) approach on a mechanical pulsator. The fatigue limit was determined using two different statistical approaches according to Dixon and Little. The obtained data were compared to those reported in the ISO standard for steels of similar performance. Additional analyses, i.e., Scanning Electron Microscopy SEM, were carried out to provide a further insight of the behavior 17-4PH AM material and in order to investigate the presence of possible defects in the tested gears, responsible for the final failure.},

The influences of milling depth, initial temperature and milling speed on the forming quality of the formed part were analyzed. The results show that milling changes the residual stress distribution of the deposition layer, which can reduce or even change the residual tensile stress on the surface of the deposition layer produced by the additive manufacturing process into compressive stress, and the equivalent Mises stress decreases by 47% compared with the original forming surface. When the initial temperature increases from 20 °C to 400 °C, the maximum equivalent Mises stress of the milling surface decreases by 26%.},

ABSTRACT = {Conventional Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) equipment can only deposit materials in a single direction, limiting the strength of printed products. Robotic 3D printing provides more degrees of freedom (DOF) to control the material deposition and has become a trend in additive manufacturing. However, there is little discussion on the strength effect of multi-DOF printing. This paper presents an efficient process framework for multi-axis 3D printing based on the robot to improve the strength. A multi-DOF continuous toolpath planning method is designed to promote the printed part’s strength and surface quality. We generate curve layers along the model surfaces and fill Fermat spiral in the layers. The method makes it possible to take full advantage of the multi-axis robot arm to achieve smooth printing on surfaces with high curvature and avoid the staircase effect and collision in the process. To further improve print quality, a control strategy is provided to synchronize the material extrusion and robot arm movement. Experiments show that the tensile strength increases by 22–167% compared with the conventional flat slicing method for curved-surface parts. The surface quality is improved by eliminating the staircase effect. The continuous toolpath planning also supports continuous fiber-reinforced printing without a cutting device. Finally, we compared with other multi-DOF printing, the application scenarios, and limitations are given.},

ABSTRACT = {Complex 3D objects with microstructures can be modelled using the function representation (FRep) approach and then manufactured. The task of modelling a geometric object with a sophisticated microstructure based on unit cell repetition is often too computationally expensive for CAD systems. FRep provides efficient tools to solve this problem. However, even for FRep the slicing step required for manufacturing can take a significant amount of time. An accelerated slicing algorithm for FRep 3D objects is proposed in this paper. This algorithm allows the preparation of FRep models for 3D printing without surface generation stage. The spatial index is employed to accelerate the slicing process. A novel compound adaptive criterion and a novel acceleration criterion are proposed to speed up the evaluation of the defining function of an FRep object. The use of these criteria is significantly reducing the computational time for contour construction during the slicing process. The K-d tree and R-tree data structures are used as spatial indexes. The performance of the accelerated slicing algorithm was tested. The contouring time was reduced 100-fold due to using the novel compound adaptive criterion with the novel acceleration criterion.},

ABSTRACT = {Thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) is a life-saving therapy for type B aortic dissection (TBAD). However, surveillance computed tomography (CT) scans in post-TEVAR patients are associated with high radiation dose, thus resulting in potential risk of radiation-induced malignancy. In this study, we developed a patient-specific three-dimensional (3D) printed phantom with stent grafts in situ, then scanned the phantom with different CT protocols to determine the optimal scanning parameters for post-treatment patients. The CT scans were conducted with different kVp and pitch values (80, 100, 120 kVp and pitch of 1.2, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5), resulting in a total of 12 datasets. Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) was measured to determine and compare the image quality between different datasets. Results showed no significant differences in SNR between different kVp when the pitch value was 1.2. At low pitch values, a decrease in kVp from 120 to 80 led to a significant effective dose reduction by more than 20%. SNR decreased by 30% when pitch was increased from 1.2 to 2.5 at 80 kVp, and 20% at 120 kVp. In contrast, there was only a 3.9% decrease in SNR when kVp was reduced from 120 to 80 at pitch 1.2, and 15.9% at pitch 2.5. High pitch with 100 kVp can effectively reduce the dose while maintaining image quality.},

ABSTRACT = {Material extrusion additive manufacturing (MEX) is a versatile technology for producing complex specimens of polymers, ceramics and metals. Highly-filled filaments composed of a binder system and a high-volume content of sinterable powders are needed to produce ceramic or metal parts. After shaping the parts via MEX, the binder is removed and the specimens are sintered to obtain a dense part of the sintered filler particles. In this article, the applicability of this additive manufacturing process to produce copper specimens is demonstrated. The particular emphasis is on investigating the production of lightweight specimens that retain mechanical properties without increasing their weight. The effect of infill grades and the cover presence on the debinding process and the flexural properties of the sintered parts was studied. It was observed that covers could provide the same flexural strength with a maximum weight reduction of approximately 23%. However, a cover on specimens with less than 100% infill significantly slows down the debinding process. The results demonstrate the applicability of MEX to produce lightweight copper specimens.},

The materials used consist of recycled PET and virgin PET. An assessment of all the forty test pieces of both kinds of PET was undertaken. A comparison of the test samples’ tensile strength values, difference in stress-strain curves, and elongation at break was also carried out. The reasoning behind the fracturing of test pieces that printed with different settings is presented in part by the depiction of the fractured specimens following the tensile test. An optimal route was revealed to be 3D printing with recycled PET, as per the mechanical testing. The hardness of the recycled filament decreased to 6%, while the tensile strength and shear strength increased to 14.7 and 2.8%, respectively. Nonetheless, no changes occurred to the tensile modulus elasticity. Despite notable differences being observed in the results of the recycled PET filament, no substantial differences were found prior or post-recycling in the mechanical properties of the PET filament. In conclusion, the demand for improved recycled 3D printing filament technologies is heightened due to the comparable mechanical features of the specimens of both the 3D printed recycled and virgin materials. With tensile strength figures reaching as high as 43.15MPa at Recycled PET and 3.12% being the greatest elongation at 40% Recycled PET, 100% Recycled is the ideal printing setting.},

ABSTRACT = {The subject of the present study is the reproduction of a submersible electric pump impeller through reverse engineering and additive manufacturing. All of the phases commonly envisaged in the reproduction of an existing piece were carried out. The aim of the study is to show how the chosen pump component can be effectively re-engineered and produced with the selective laser melting technique, obtaining a final product that is comparable if not even better than the starting one. To achieve this goal, the original piece was redesigned and a new model was created and analyzed. The whole process has been split into three main phases: (i) realization of the three-dimensional model from an existing piece using reverse engineering techniques; (ii) finite element analysis for the optimization of the use of the material; and (iii) 3D printing of a concept model in polyethylene terephthalate by using the fused deposition modeling technology and of the functional model in AISI 316 stainless steel with selective laser melting technology.},

ABSTRACT = {In contrast to the traditional 3D printing process, where material is deposited layer-by-layer on horizontal flat surfaces, conformal 3D printing enables users to create structures on non-planar surfaces for different and innovative applications. Translating a 2D pattern to any arbitrary non-planar surface, such as a tessellated one, is challenging because the available software for printing is limited to planar slicing. The present research outlines an easy-to-use mathematical algorithm to project a printing trajectory as a sequence of points through a vector-defined direction on any triangle-tessellated non-planar surface. The algorithm processes the ordered points of the 2D version of the printing trajectory, the tessellated STL files of the target surface, and the projection direction. It then generates the new trajectory lying on the target surface with the G-code instructions for the printer. As a proof of concept, several examples are presented, including a Hilbert curve and lattices printed on curved surfaces, using a conventional fused filament fabrication machine. The algorithm’s effectiveness is further demonstrated by translating a printing trajectory to an analytical surface. The surface is tessellated and fed to the algorithm as an input to compare the results, demonstrating that the error depends on the resolution of the tessellated surface rather than on the algorithm itself.},

ABSTRACT = {High cost, unpredictable defects and out-of-tolerance rejections in final parts are preventing the complete deployment of Laser-based Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) on an industrial scale. Repeatability, speed and right-first-time manufacturing require synergistic design approaches. In addition, post-build finishing operations of LPBF parts are the object of increasing attention to avoid the risk of bottlenecks in the machining step. An aluminum component for automotive application was redesigned through topology optimization and Design for Additive Manufacturing. Simulation of the build process allowed to choose the orientation and the support location for potential lowest deformation and residual stresses. Design for Finishing was adopted in order to facilitate the machining operations after additive construction. The optical dimensional check proved a good correspondence with the tolerances predicted by process simulation and confirmed part acceptability. A cost and time comparison versus CNC alone attested to the convenience of LPBF unless single parts had to be produced.},

ABSTRACT = {Continuous improvement (CI) is a key component of lean manufacturing (LM), which is fundamental for organizations to remain competitive in an ever more challenging market. At present, the new industrial revolution, Industry 4.0 (I4.0), is taking place in the manufacturing and service markets, allowing more intelligent and automated processes to become a reality through innovative technologies. Not much research was found regarding a holistic application of I4.0′s technological concepts towards CI, which clarifies the potential for improving its effectiveness. This clearly indicates that research is needed regarding this subject. The present publication intends to close this research gap by studying the main I4.0 technological concepts and their possible application towards a typical CI process, establishing the requirements for such an approach. Based on that study, a conceptual approach is proposed (PDCA 4.0), depicting how I4.0 technological concepts should be used for CI enhancement, while aiming to satisfy the identified requirements. By outlining the PDCA 4.0 approach, this paper contributes to increasing the knowledge available regarding the CI realm on how to support the CI shift towards a I4.0 industrial paradigm.},

ABSTRACT = {Railway wheelsets are the key to ensuring the safe operation of trains. To achieve zero-defect production, railway equipment manufacturers must strictly control every link in the wheelset production process. The press-fit curve output by the wheelset assembly machine is an essential indicator of the wheelset’s assembly quality. The operators will still need to manually and individually recheck press-fit curves in our practical case. However, there are many uncertainties in the manual inspection. For example, subjective judgment can easily cause inconsistent judgment results between different inspectors, or the probability of human misinterpretation can increase as the working hours increase. Therefore, this study proposes an intelligent railway wheelset inspection system based on deep learning, which improves the reliability and efficiency of manual inspection of wheelset assembly quality. To solve the severe imbalance in the number of collected images, this study establishes a predicted model of press-fit quality based on a deep Siamese network. Our experimental results show that the precision measurement is outstanding for the testing dataset contained 3863 qualified images and 28 unqualified images of press-fit curves. The proposed system will serve as a successful case of a paradigm shift from traditional manufacturing to digital manufacturing.},

ABSTRACT = {Even though additive manufacturing is receiving increasing interest from aerospace, automotive, and shipbuilding, the legacy approach using tessellated form representation and cross-section slice algorithm still has the essential limitation of its inaccuracy of geometrical information and volumetric losses of final outputs. This paper introduces an innovative method to represent multi-material and multi-directional layers defined in boundary-representation standard model and to process complex sliced layers without missing volumes by using the proposed squashing operation. Applications of the proposed method to a bending part, an internal structure, and an industrial moulding product show the assurance of building original shape without missing volume during the comparison with the legacy method. The results show that using boundary representation and te squashing algorithm in the geometric process of additive manufacturing is expected to improve the inaccuracy that was the barrier of applying additive process to various metal industries.},

We fabricated and integrated a local shield and a cover for the area below the local shield to achieve higher shielding ability. The tensile strength of the fabricated object met the forging standard for Ti-6Al-4V, but elongation was about 7%. We also focused on the possibility of reducing the cutting force and increasing the efficiency of the finishing process by cutting workpieces softened by high temperature immediately after the deposition process. We investigated the cutting force and tool wear of the fabricated objects heated to 300 °C using ceramics tools. Results showed that although the cutting force was reduced at high temperature, the wear rate of the tools was high, and the increase in cutting force due to wear was significant.},

ABSTRACT = {Laser processing plays an important role in industrial manufacturing, in which a galvanometer scanner (GS) functions as the core component of the laser processing equipment. With the development of the digital system, the GS based on the digital system finds a broader range of potential application. In order to address the slow step-responses of a GS with disturbance and parameter perturbation, the mathematical model of the motor of the GS is derived and a discrete-time sliding-mode variable-structure controller (DSVC) based on a decoupled disturbance compensator (DDC) (DSVC+DDC) is designed. The step-response performance of a GS is the key factor affecting the quality evaluation of laser processing. Experiments are conducted on the step responses of the motor of the GS on a digital experimental platform. The experiment results show that when guaranteeing a steady-state error within 20 urad and an overshoot of less than 5%, the rise time for step-responses in 1% and 10% of the whole stroke is 1 and 2 ms, decreasing by 23% and 58% compared with the reference performance index, which indicates the effectiveness of the proposed method. The proposed approach can not only compensate for the external disturbance online and improve the step-response speed of the GS, but also relax the traditionally assumed limit of the upper bound of external disturbance to the limit of the change rate of external disturbance, which reduces the difficulty of a practical application. This method has great significance for further applications in high precision machining.},

ABSTRACT = {Microstructured steel 40Cr13, which is considered a hard-to-machine steel due to its high mechanical strength and hardness, has wide applications in the dies industry. This study investigates the influence of three process parameters of a 355 nm nanosecond pulse laser on the ablation results of 40Cr13, based on analysis of variance (ANOVA) and back propagation (BP) neural network. The ANOVA results show that laser power has the greatest influence on the ablation depth, width, and material removal rate (MRR), with influence levels of 52.5%, 60.9%, and 70.4%, respectively. The scan speed affects the ablation depth and width to a certain extent, and the influence of the pulse frequency on the ablation depth and MRR is non-negligible. BP neural network models with 3-8-3, 3-10-3, and 3-12-3 structures were applied to predict the ablation results. The results show that the prediction accuracy is relatively high for the ablation width and MRR, with average prediction accuracies of 96.0% and 93.5%. The 3-8-3 network model has the highest prediction accuracy for the ablation width, and the 3-10-3 network model has the highest prediction accuracy for the ablation depth and MRR.},

ABSTRACT = {The definition of air resistance is nonuniform when analyzing the bearing capacity, stiffness, and stability of an orifice throttling aerostatic restrictor. In this study, a capillary tube similar to the inlet section of an aerostatic restrictor is used as the research object, and the Bernoulli equation under adiabatic conditions is established. Through an experiment, the pressure and temperature of the capillary tube inlet and outlet and the flow through the capillary tube are measured. Based on the air resistance definition, the empirical formula of the coefficient k is obtained, and the theoretical air resistance of the capillary path is calculated. The relative error between the theoretical air resistance and experimental air resistance is kept within 10%. The comparison results verify the accuracy of the air resistance theory and provide a basis for the subsequent establishment of a universal definition of air resistance. Subsequently, air resistance can be used to design aerostatic bearings and help improve their characteristics.},

ABSTRACT = {A variable area nozzle integrated into the design of a high-bypass-ratio turbofan engine effectively saves up to 10% in aircraft fuel consumption. Additionally, noise emissions can be lowered at airports during take-off and landing by having better control of the nozzle diameter. Shape memory capabilities of Nitinol alloys could be availed in the form of actuators in the construction of such a nozzle. However, these Nitinol actuators must be joined to Ti-6Al-4V, a prominent alloy making up most of the rest of the nozzle. Because of the huge differences in the physical and metallurgical properties of these alloys, fusion welding is not as effective as solid-state welding. In the current study, a linear friction welding process was adopted to join Ti-6Al-4V to Nitinol successfully. The effect of friction welding on the evolution of weld macro and microstructures; hardness and tensile properties were studied and discussed. The macrostructure of Ti-6Al-4V and Nitinol’s dissimilar joint revealed flash formation mainly on the Ti-6Al-4V side due to its reduced flow strength at high temperatures. Optical microstructures revealed fine grains in Ti-6Al-4V immediately adjacent to the interface due to dynamic recrystallisation and strain hardening effects. In contrast, Nitinol remained mostly unaffected. An intermetallic compound (Ti2Ni) was seen to have formed at the interface due to the extreme rubbing action, and these adversely influenced the tensile strength and elongation values of the joints.},

ABSTRACT = {Dissimilar metal joining has always been a challenging task because of the metallurgical incompatibility and difference in melting points of alloys being joined. Diffusion and mixing of alloying elements from dissimilar base metals at the weld often cause unwanted metallurgical changes resulting in unsuccessful welds or underperformance of the weldment. Solid-state dissimilar friction welds of Inconel 718 and F22 were prepared in this study with an Inconel 625 interlayer to address the carbon enrichment of Inconel 718 during the welding. Defect-free rotary friction welds were produced in this study. Microstructural and mechanical properties investigation of the weldments and base metals was carried out, and results were analysed. Intermixing zone was observed at the weld interface due to the softening of the metal at the interface and rotatory motion during the welding. The high temperatures and the plastic deformation of the intermixing zone and thermo-mechanically affected zone (TMAZ) resulted in the grain refinement of the weld region. The highest hardness was observed at the Inconel 718/F22 weld interface due to the plastic strain and the carbon diffusion. The tensile specimens failed in the F22 base metal for the weld prepared with and without the Inconel 625 interlayer. Inconel 718/F22 welds exhibited lower toughness values compared to the Inconel 718/F22 welds prepared with Inconel 625 interlayer.},

ABSTRACT = {The use of Topology Optimization techniques has seen a great development since the last decade. The principal contributor to this trend is the widespread use of Additive Manufacturing technologies to effectively build complex and performant structures over different settings. Nevertheless, the use of Topology Optimization in Design for Additive Manufacturing processes is not simple and research aims to fill the gap between theory and practice by evolving at the same time both approaches, workflows, and design software that allow their implementation. Since a strong connection between methodologies and tools exists, this work proposes a method to assess computer-aided design tools or platforms. This can be applied to sustain the key phase for selection and adoption of the computer-aided tools in industrial settings embracing Additive Manufacturing. The workflow for Topology Optimization implementation, the structure of the proposed evaluation approach, and its application, are presented to demonstrate effective usability. The automotive case study is the redesign of internal combustion engine piston to benefit of metal Additive Manufacturing based enhanced product performance. A preliminary finite element model is defined and a Topology Optimization based redesign is concurrently set up through four different commercial computer-based platforms. The method accounting for the assessment of required operations for the design optimization is applied to perform the tools selection phase.},

ABSTRACT = {The material properties of 3D printed continuous fiber composites have been studied many times in the last years. However, only a minimal number of samples were used to determine the properties in each of the reported studies. Moreover, reported results can hardly be compared due to different sample geometries. Consequently, the variability of the mechanical properties (from one sample to the other) is a crucial parameter that has not been well quantified yet. In the present work, the flexural properties of 3D printed continuous carbon fiber/nylon composite specimens were experimentally quantified, using batches of 15 test specimens. In order to account for the possible influence of the quality of the prepreg filaments on the observed variability, three different filament rolls were used to manufacture the different batches. Also, two configurations were tested, with a fiber direction parallel (longitudinal) or perpendicular (transverse) to the main axis of the specimens. The results show moderate to high variabilities of the flexural modulus, flexural strength and maximum strain. The coefficient of variation was more than twice as high in the transverse case as in the longitudinal case.},

ABSTRACT = {An important issue when designing conformal lattice structures is the geometric modeling and prediction of mechanical properties. This paper presents suitable methods for obtaining optimized conformal lattice structures and validating them without the need for high computational power and time, enabling the designer to have quick feedback in the first design phases. A wireframe modeling method based on non-uniform rational basis spline (NURBS) free-form deformation (FFD) that allows conforming a regular lattice structure inside a design space is presented. Next, a previously proposed size optimization method is adopted for optimizing the cross-sections of lattice structures. Finally, two different commercial finite element software are involved for the validation of the results, based on Euler–Bernoulli and Timoshenko beam theories. The findings highlight the adaptability of the NURBS-FFD modeling approach and the reliability of the size optimization method, especially in stretching-dominated cell topologies and load conditions. At the same time, the limitation of the structural beam analysis when dealing with thick beams is noted. Moreover, the behavior of different kinds of lattices was investigated.},

In this paper, we present the feasibility of using DHM to determine the presence of nanoparticles in the FDM process. Experimental results validate this technology’s precision and provide extensive knowledge about the implications of the FDM on health. The measure of the thin films deposited in glass substrates was between a minimum of 9 nm to a maximum of 200 nm, in agreement with the previous studies.},

ABSTRACT = {In recent years, biomimetic materials inspired from natural organisms have attracted great attention due to their promising functionalities and cutting-edge applications, emerging as an important research topic. For example, how to reduce the reflectivity of the solid surface and increase the absorption of the substrate surface is essential for developing light response smart surface. Suitable solutions to this issue can be found in natural creatures; however, it is technologically challenging. In this work, inspired from butterfly wings, we proposed a laser processing technology to prepare micro nanostructured titanium alloy surfaces with anti-reflection properties. The reflectivity is significantly suppressed, and thus, the light absorption is improved. Consequently, the anti-reflection titanium alloy surface can be further employed as a photothermal substrate for developing light-responsive slippery surface. The sliding behavior of liquid droplets on the smart slippery surface can be well controlled via light irradiation. This method facilitates the preparation of low-reflection and high-absorption metallic surfaces towards bionic applications.},

ABSTRACT = {Nano-manipulation technology, as a kind of “bottom-up” tool, has exhibited an excellent capacity in the field of measurement and fabrication on the nanoscale. Although variety manipulation methods based on probes and microscopes were proposed and widely used due to locating and imaging with high resolution, the development of non-contacted schemes for these methods is still indispensable to operate small objects without damage. However, optical manipulation, especially near-field trapping, is a perfect candidate for establishing brilliant manipulation systems. This paper reports about simulations on the electric and force fields at the tips of metallic probes irradiated by polarized laser outputted coming from a scanning near-field optical microscope probe. Distributions of electric and force field at the tip of a probe have proven that the polarized laser can induce nanoscale evanescent fields with high intensity, which arouse effective force to move nanoparticles. Moreover, schemes with dual probes are also presented and discussed in this paper. Simulation results indicate that different combinations of metallic probes and polarized lasers will provide diverse near-field and corresponding optical force. With the suitable direction of probes and polarization direction, the dual probe exhibits higher trapping force and wider effective wavelength range than a single probe. So, these results give more novel and promising selections for realizing optical manipulation in experiments, so that distinguished multi-functional manipulation systems can be developed.},

ABSTRACT = {Nanowire interconnection is the basis for the construction and integration of micro-nano functional devices. But so far, it is still difficult to achieve a reliable interconnection of metal oxide nanowires. This letter proposes an approach for soldering ZnO nanowires through femtosecond laser irradiation of Ag nanoparticles solder. In this paper, the effect of femtosecond laser fluence and irradiation time on the morphology of Ag solders and the interconnection state of ZnO nanowires are studied, respectively. The I-V electrical characterization of nanowire interconnection before and after soldering is completed. The results demonstrate that ZnO nanowires achieve better interconnection. The UV light response of the ZnO-Ag-ZnO interconnection structure after soldering is investigated. The approach confirms the effectiveness of a femtosecond irradiated metal nanoparticles solder to achieve metal oxide interconnection, offering the prospect of more metal oxide nanowires interconnection and device development.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, laser surface treatment of Al alloy was studied by comparison of sandblasting and laser ablation. The effects of laser spot distribution on surface roughness, contact angle, chemical composition and shear strength of Al alloy were analyzed. The experimental results showed that the bonding performance of Al alloy are promoted by controlling the laser spot spacing. When laser spot spacing was smaller than the size of the laser spot, micro–nano composite structures were induced by multiple laser pulses, which would improve shear strength by increasing the contact area between Al alloy and adhesive. Using laser surface treatment, the adhesion properties on Al alloy can be promoted.},

ABSTRACT = {SiC/SiC ceramic matrix composites (CMCs) are widely applied in the aerospace and nuclear industries due to their excellent material nature (strength, hardness, and irradiation tolerance) at high-temperature loads. However, high-quality machining cannot be easily realized because of the anisotropic material structure and its properties. In this study, a laser water jet (LWJ) was adopted for CMCs machining. Firstly, the finite element model (FEM) was established describing a representative three-dimensional microstructure including weft yarn, warp yarn, SiC base, and the pyrolytic carbon (PyC) fiber coating. The temperature distribution, as well as its evolution rule on substrate surface under LWJ machining, was analyzed. Moreover, a single-dot ablation test was carried out to verify the accuracy of the numerical simulation model. Secondly, the variation in maximum temperatures under different laser pulse energy was obtained by means of FEM. Nonetheless, a non-negligible deviation emerged in the ablation depth of the numerical calculation and experimental results. Although the simulation results were obviously superior to the experimental results, their proportions of different machining parameters reached an agreement. This phenomenon can be explained by the processing characteristics of LWJ. Finally, single-row and multi-row scribing experiments for CMCs with 3 mm thickness were developed to clarify the processing capacity of LWJ. The experimental results indicated that single-tow scribing has a limiting value at a groove depth of 2461 μm, while complete cutting off can only be realized by multi-row scribing of LWJ. In addition, the cross-section of CMCs treated by LWJ presented a surface morphology without a recast layer, pulling out of SiC fibers, and delamination. The theoretical and experimental results can offer primary technical support for the high-quality machining of CMCs.},

ABSTRACT = {Simple analog devices like manometers, manual valves, etc., have been ignored in the digitization process that has characterized the transition towards Industry 4.0. The reason behind this is that their substitution with the equivalent digital versions is high cost and needs re-wiring. This study introduces a low-cost wireless and passive model aligned with the Industry 4.0 paradigm to digitize analog indicators. The concept is based on electromagnetic (EM) shielding of the manometer’s embedded radio frequency identification (RFID) tag. We designed and tuned a new tiny RFID tag to be embedded into analog devices. Finally, a digitized manometer by RFID electromagnetic shielding concept is simulated in the Ansys HFSS modeling environment.},

ABSTRACT = {Imagine the possibility to save a simulation at any time, modify or analyze it, and restart again with exactly the same state. The conceptualization and its concrete manifestation in the implementation OntologySim is demonstrated in this paper. The presented approach of a fully ontology-based simulation can solve current challenges in modeling and simulation in production science. Due to the individualization and customization of products and the resulting increase in complexity of production, a need for flexibly adaptable simulations arises. This need is exemplified in the trend towards Digital Twins and Digital Shadows. Their application to production systems, against the background of an ever increasing speed of change in such systems, is arduous. Moreover, missing understandability and human interpretability of current approaches hinders successful, goal oriented applications. The OntologySim can help solving this challenge by providing the ability to generate truly cyber physical systems, both interlocked with reality and providing a simulation framework. In a nutshell, this paper presents a discrete-event-based open-source simulation using multi-agency and ontology.},

ABSTRACT = {The nano-scale spatial positioning of nanoparticles in tumor cells can be achieved through the double-helix point spread functions (DH-PSF). Nevertheless, certain issues such as low light intensity concentration of the main lobes, the influence of the side lobes, and the aberrations of the imaging system result in poor image quality and reduce the positioning accuracy of the fluorescent nanoparticles. In this paper, an iterative optimization algorithm that combines Laguerre–Gaussian modes and Zernike polynomials is proposed. The double-helix point spread function, constructed by the linear superposition of the Laguerre–Gaussian mode and Zernike polynomials, is used to express aberrations in the imaging system. The simulation results indicated that the light intensity concentration of the main lobes is increased by 45.51% upon the use of the optimization process. Based on the simulation results, the phase modulation plate was designed and processed while a 4f positioning imaging system was built. Human osteosarcoma cells, labeled by CdTe/CdS/ZnS quantum dots, were used as samples, and the position imaging experiment was carried out. The image information entropy was used as the clarity evaluation index. The experimental results showed that the image information entropy of the DH-PSF position imaging was reduced from 4.22 before optimization to 2.65 after optimization, and the image clarity was significantly improved. This result verified the effectiveness of the optimization method that was proposed in this work.},

ABSTRACT = {Background—Aircraft inspection is crucial for safe flight operations and is predominantly performed by human operators, who are unreliable, inconsistent, subjective, and prone to err. Thus, advanced technologies offer the potential to overcome those limitations and improve inspection quality. Method—This paper compares the performance of human operators with image processing, artificial intelligence software and 3D scanning for different types of inspection. The results were statistically analysed in terms of inspection accuracy, consistency and time. Additionally, other factors relevant to operations were assessed using a SWOT and weighted factor analysis. Results—The results show that operators’ performance in screen-based inspection tasks was superior to inspection software due to their strong cognitive abilities, decision-making capabilities, versatility and adaptability to changing conditions. In part-based inspection however, 3D scanning outperformed the operator while being significantly slower. Overall, the strength of technological systems lies in their consistency, availability and unbiasedness. Conclusions—The performance of inspection software should improve to be reliably used in blade inspection. While 3D scanning showed the best results, it is not always technically feasible (e.g., in a borescope inspection) nor economically viable. This work provides a list of evaluation criteria beyond solely inspection performance that could be considered when comparing different inspection systems.},

ABSTRACT = {In order to solve the problems of multiple process parameters, difficult control and high process requirements in laser first/second scribing of aerospace chemical milling thin-wall parts, a laser scribing depth model based on thermal energy balance was established, and the relationship between laser power and speed was established with scribing depth as a target. Using AC850 laser scribing maskant as coating material, the effects of laser power, scribing speed, laser frequency, forward angle and side slope angle on the scribing depth were studied by single factor experiment. Experimental results show that the theoretical model is in good agreement with experimental data. The laser scribing depth is positively proportional to the laser power and inversely proportional to the laser speed and has little relationship with the laser frequency. The predicted accuracy of the mathematical equations regarding the laser power density and scribing depth, calculated by the laser power, speed and scribing depths experimental data, are 88.53% and 90.79%. The laser scribing depth at a forward angle of 6° and a side slope angle of 7° is deeper compared with the vertical incident scribing depth, and the angle is also the recommended angle of laser scribing. Based on the simplified regression model, the laser scribing depth model can be directly used in the laser NC system to realize the adaptive adjustment and accurate control of laser energy according to the actual laser speed.},

ABSTRACT = {Refurbished products are gaining importance in many industrial sectors, specifically high-value products whose residual value is relevant and guarantee the economic viability of the re-manufacturing at an industrial level, e.g., turbine blades for power generation. In this paper, we address the robust scheduling scheme of re-manufacturing activities for turbine blades. Parts entering the process may have very different wear states or presence of defects. Thus, the repair process is affected by a significant degree of uncertainty. The paper investigates the uncertainties and discusses how they affect the scheduling performance of the re-manufacturing system. We then present a robust scheduling framework for the re-manufacturing scheduling strategies, policies, and methods. This framework is based on a wide variety of experimental and practical approaches in the re-manufacturing scheduling area, which will be a guideline for the planning and scheduling of re-manufacturing activities of turbine blades. A case study approach was adopted to examine how re-manufacturers design their scheduling strategies.},

ABSTRACT = {Binder jetting holds great potential for revolutionizing conventional production processes for high-performance components. However, current applications face significant challenges regarding the depowdering and cleaning of complex internal geometries. A novel approach to these challenges is splitting the desired component into smaller, easy-to-clean parts and using sinter bonding to achieve the desired shape. This greatly reduces manual cleaning and preparation time during the production since sintering is required in any case. The sinter joint is currently significantly weaker than the rest of the part and may pose a risk of failure. This study focuses on the effects of different parameters that influence the joint strength and the contact surface between two parts. With different experimental setups, a variety of influences is identified and quantified: depowdering air pressure, component orientation in the build box, initial contact pressure between the green parts, and macroscopic component deformation. The experimental results are supported by a modified Boussinesq contact model. Combining experiments and simulations, it was found that the relative contact between two green parts varies between 5 and 26%, depending on the parameter set used. In this study, the authors introduce the idea of two-part manufacturing in metal binder jetting and subsequent joining of the components in the sintering process.},

ABSTRACT = {The emergence of additive manufacturing is renovating the landscape of available production technologies. In this paper, we describe the fabrication of a closed vane pump impeller (ϕ 206 mm, height 68 mm, weight 4 kg) by binder jetting 3D printing of a sand mould followed by casting using stainless steel 316 to create an identical copy of a part in service in a chemical plant in Tarragona, Spain. The original part was reverse engineered and used to create a sand mould by binder jetting 3D printing on which new impellers were fabricated by casting. Metallographic studies showed an austenitic matrix with 6.3% of ferritic phase and 40 μm × 8 μm ferrite grains without precipitated carbides. The impeller was put into operation in a centrifugal pump at a polyol/polyglycol plant belonging to Dow Chemical Ibérica SL from October 2020 to April 2021. Process variables related to the pump behaviour were compared with the same variables obtained in previous cycles with the original impeller for three different product viscosities (30, 180, and 500 cSt). At 500 cSt, the average current consumption was 9.34 A as compared with the 9.41 A measured with the original impeller. Similarly, the pump pressure remained essentially constant during process operation with both impellers (3.97 bar with the new impeller vs. 3.99 bar with the old). Other monitored parameters (product flow, tank level) were similar in both cases, validating the fabrication strategy from an operational point of view. This work further demonstrated that the implementation of additive manufacturing technologies in chemical process engineering is a useful solution to fabricate spare parts that are difficult to replicate with other technologies, providing consequent economic benefits.},

ABSTRACT = {Wire arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) is the process by which large, metallic structures are built, layer-by-layer, using a welding arc to melt wire feedstock. In this process, the proper selection of the shielding gas plays a vital role in the achievement of structurally acceptable part geometries and quality surface finishes. In this study, the authors used either a ternary mix (He, Ar and CO2) or a binary mix (Ar and CO2) of shielding gases to deposit wall geometries using an open loop-controlled WAAM system developed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory’s Manufacturing Demonstration Facility. The binary blend produced a wider and shorter geometry, while the ternary blend resulted in a narrower build that was more equivalent to the CAD geometry. The data indicated that the binary blend provided a higher oxygen concentration in the weld as compared to that of the ternary blend. The results imply that the arc characteristics and heat input had a significantly higher impact on the weld penetration than the surface tension effect of surface active elements. This was further verified by developing and applying a high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model of the thermophysical properties of gas mixtures. The results from the model showed that, while the influence of increased oxygen concentration on the surface tension for the binary blend led to a deeper penetration, the ternary blend gave rise to heat flux to the workpiece.},

A fused silicon mirror is polished, and the result shows that the proposed device effectively compensates for robotic normal positioning error and simultaneously maintains the stability of the polishing process. After deterministic polishing, the PV (peak to valley) of the figure is reduced from 126.56nm to 56.95nm, and the RMS (root mean square) is reduced from 22.15 nm to 7.59 nm.},

ABSTRACT = {Industry 4.0 is leading society into a new era characterized by smart communications between consumers and enterprises. While entertainment and fashion brands aim to consolidate their identities, increasing consumers’ participation in new, engaging, and immersive experiences, other industry sectors such as food and drugs are called to adhere to stricter regulations to increase the quality assurance of their processes. The pharmaceutical industry is inherently one of the most regulated sectors because the safety, integrity, and conservation along the distribution network are the main pillars for guaranteeing the efficacy of drugs for the general public. Favoured by Industry 4.0 incentives, pharmaceutical serialization has become a must in the last few years and is now in place worldwide. In this paper, a decentralized solution based on non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which can improve the track and trace capability of the standard serialization process, is presented. Non-fungible tokens are minted in the blockchain and inherit all the advantages provided by this technology. As blockchain technology is becoming more and more popular, adoption of track and trace will increase tremendously. Focusing on the pharmaceutical industry’s use of track and trace, this paper presents the concepts and architectural elements necessary to support the non-fungible token solution, culminating in the presentation of a use case with a prototypical application.},

ABSTRACT = {Monocrystalline silicon has shown great potential in constructing advanced devices in semiconductor, photoelectric, and photochemistry fields. The fabrication of micro-grooves with large depth-to-width ratio (DTWR) and low taper is in urgent demand as this type of groove can significantly promote the device performance. The grooves with such characterizations can hardly be achieved by conventional machining techniques owing to the high hardness and brittleness of silicon. Laser waterjet (LWJ) machining is a promising solution, which is capable of ablating materials with less or no heat defects, well machining precision, and consistency. Therefore, this paper firstly established a theoretical model describing the interaction between silicon and LWJ. Through the numerical simulation, the evolution of temperature and stress distribution at the machining region was analyzed. Variation experiments were carried out correspondingly. On these bases, scribing experiments were put forward aimed at discovering the influence of machining parameters on groove morphology. Optimized scribing strategy which is capable of realizing the construction of a micro-groove with DTWR of 19.03 and taper of 0.013 was obtained. The results contributed to the understanding of LWJ processing of silicon on a small scale as well as broadening the application prospects of LWJ for treating other semiconductor devices.},

ABSTRACT = {The present study investigated the influence of welding speed on the microstructure, hardness, and tensile properties of the AZ31 Mg alloy gas tungsten arc (GTA) welds that were prepared using alternating current (AC). A microstructural examination of the weld metal and base metal was performed using stereo, optical, and scanning electron microscopy (HR-SEM and EDS) techniques. The microstructure of all fusion zones consists of two parts: a columnar zone, adjacent to the fusion boundary, and equiaxed grains, in the centre of the weld fusion zone. It is shown that the average width of the equiaxed zone present at the centre of the fusion zone increases with increasing welding speed. Metallographic examination shows that the highest welding speed (5 mm/s) results in the smallest average grain size. The welds prepared with high welding speed exhibit an increase in strength, hardness, and ductility compared with other welding speeds, which is attributed to low heat input.},

ABSTRACT = {Recent progress in bioprinting has made possible the creation of complex 3D intestinal constructs, including vascularized villi. However, for their integration into functional units useful for experimentation or implantation, the next challenge is to endow them with a larger-scale, anatomically realistic vasculature. In general, the perfusion of bioprinted constructs has remained difficult, and the current solution is to provide them with mostly linear and simply branched channels. To address this limitation, here we demonstrated an image analysis-based workflow leading through computer-assisted design from anatomic images of rodent mesentery and colon to the actual printing of such patterns with paste and hydrogel bioinks. Moreover, we reverse-engineered the 2D intestinal image-derived designs into cylindrical objects, and 3D-printed them in a support hydrogel. These results open the path towards generation of more realistically vascularized tissue constructs for a variety of personalized medicine applications.},

ABSTRACT = {Global digitization trends and the application of high technology in the garment market are still too slow to integrate, despite the increasing demand for automated solutions. The main challenge is related to the extraction of garment information-general clothing descriptions and automatic dimensional extraction. In this paper, we propose the garment measurement solution based on image processing technologies, which is divided into two phases, garment segmentation and key points extraction. UNet as a backbone network has been used for mask retrieval. Separate algorithms have been developed to identify both general and specific garment key points from which the dimensions of the garment can be calculated by determining the distances between them. Using this approach, we have resulted in an average 1.27 cm measurement error for the prediction of the basic measurements of blazers, 0.747 cm for dresses and 1.012 cm for skirts.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper presents modern copper-matrix composite materials in which volcanic tuff particles are used as a reinforcing phase. The aim of the research was to determine the optimal shares of volcanic tuff additive based on such criteria as softening temperature, relative density, electrical conductivity, and hardness. The properties of the produced and tested composites allowed us to determine the usefulness of this type of material for resistance welding electrodes. To confirm the assumptions made, preliminary investigations of the durability and behavior of electrodes made of the tested material during the processes of welding non-alloy steel sheets were carried out. As a result of the research, it was discovered that the addition of 5% tuff produces the best results in this type of composite. It was found that for the sample with a 5% share of tuff, a high softening point above 600 °C was obtained, high hardness after densification at the level of 62 HRB, and high relative density of approximately 95% and very good conductivity at the level of approximately 45 MS/m. The conducted tests did not show any electrode wear different from the commonly used alloys for resistance welding.},

ABSTRACT = {The fabrication of components involves the deposition of multiple beads in multiple layers for wire-arc additive manufacturing (WAAM). WAAM performed using gas metal arc welding (GMAW) allows for the manufacturing of parts through multiple-bead multi-layer deposition, which depends on the process variables. Thus, the selection of process parameters along with their required levels is mandatory to deposit multiple layers for WAAM. To obtain the desired levels of parameters, bead-on-plate trials were taken on the base plate of low alloy steel by following an experimental matrix produced through the Box–Behnken design (BBD) on GMAW-based WAAM. Wire feed speed, travel speed, and voltage were chosen as the input parameters and bead width and bead height were chosen as the output parameters. Furthermore, the robustness and adequacy of the obtained regression equations were analyzed by using analysis of variance (ANOVA). For both responses of BW and BH, values of R2 and adj. R2 were found to be near unity, which has shown the fitness of the model. Teaching–learning-based optimization (TLBO) technique was then employed for optimization. Within the selected range of process variables, the single-objective optimization result showed a maximum bead height (BH) of 7.81 mm, and a minimum bead width (BW) of 4.73 mm. To tackle the contradicting nature of responses, Pareto fronts were also generated, which provides a unique non-dominated solution. Validation trials were also conducted to reveal the ability and suitability of the TLBO algorithm. The discrepancy between the anticipated and measured values was observed to be negligible, with a deviation of less than 5% for all the validation trials. This demonstrates the success of the established model and TLBO algorithm. The optimum feasible settings for multi-layer metal deposition were determined after further tuning. A multi-layer structure free from any disbonding was successfully manufactured at the optimized variables. The authors suggest that the optimum parametric settings would be beneficial for the deposition of layer-by-layer weld beads for additive manufacturing of components.},

ABSTRACT = {Ti6Al4V-ELI is the most-used lightweight alloy in the aerospace industrial sector thanks to its high mechanical strength and corrosion resistance. The present paper aims, firstly, to evaluate the effects induced by different heat treatments, which were performed above and below the β-transus temperature on Ti6Al4V-ELI samples manufactured via Laser Powder-Bed Fusion in different orientations (XZ, XY, Z and 45°). The first set of tensile samples and bars were heat-treated at 1050 °C × 1 h, while the second and third set were heat-treated at 704 °C × 120′ following the AMS2801 standard specification, and at 740 °C × 130′. These heat treatments were chosen to improve the as-built mechanical properties according to the ASTM F3001 and also ASTM F2924-14 standard specifications. Optical and SEM measurements reveal primary, secondary and tertiary α-laths below the β-transus, while above this temperature, the microstructure varies in relation to the sample’s thickness. Secondly, this work analyzed the results obtained after a sandblasting process, which was performed on half of all the available heat-treated tensile samples, through XRD and Vickers microhardness measurements. XRD analysis also highlighted the presence of α2-Ti3Al and TiAl3 precipitates and the microstructural change in terms of the α-phase.},

ABSTRACT = {There has been considerable research in recent years on the additive manufacturing (AM) of carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) parts based on the process of fused deposition modeling (FDM). The currently-applied steps within the manufacturing pipeline, such as slicing and path planning, consider only the planar case of filament deposition and mostly make no use of the possibility to place single pre-impregnated (prepreg) filaments. Classical methods such as tape-laying and laminating struggle with highly curved and complex geometries and require the costly production of molds, whereas when using AM, these geometries can be realized more easily and molds can be created using the same process. In this paper, a set of algorithms is presented that aims to resolve these problems. Criteria are formulated which enable the goal oriented development and evaluation of the presented methods and represent metrics for future methods. The developed algorithms enable the use of both continuous and discontinuous fiber patches in a much wider range of applications in designing and manufacturing of CFRPs. This opens up new possibilities in this promising field. The developed metrics and infrastructure further constitute progress in the field of multi-axis non-planar path planning for slicing algorithms in general and the conducted evaluation proves the formal applicability of the developed algorithms.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper presents an optimal sensor placement method for vibration signal acquisition in the field of industrial robot health monitoring and fault diagnosis. Based on the general formula of Bayes and relative entropy, the evaluation function of sensor placement is deduced, and the modal confidence matrix is used to express the redundancy of sensor placement. The optimal placement of vibration sensors is described as a discrete variable optimization problem, which is defined as whether the existing sensor layout can obtain joint state information efficiently. The initial layout of the sensor was obtained from the structural simulation results of the industrial robots, and the initial layout was optimized by the derived objective function. The efficiency of the optimized layout in capturing joint state information is proven by the validation experiment with a simulation model. The problem of popularizing the optimization method in engineering is solved by a verification experiment without a simulation model. The optimal sensor placement method provides a theoretical basis for industrial robots to acquire vibration data effectively.},

ABSTRACT = {The aim of this project is to demonstrate a proof of concept by using Additive Manufacturing (AM) technology in order to demonstrate its viability for the production of tailor-made components with regions of varying (higher and lower) hardness and surface roughness within a single part. In order to do this, first a test piece is designed and printed following a full factorial design of the experiment with eight runs with varying process parameters set within different regions of one part. The structure is printed several times with the laser-powder-bed-fusion-based metal-additive-manufacturing system “Sodick LPM 325” using AISI 420 in order to test and validate the change in the achievable mechanical property and surface roughness. The above-mentioned quality marks are characterized using a tactile profilometer, Rockwell test and part density, and the results are statistically analyzed using MATLAB. The results show that the linear energy density plays a significant role in controlling the surface roughness of the top surface of the components while the hardness on the top surface is unaffected. On the side surfaces, it is known that the layer thickness plays a significant role on the surface roughness as well as hardness. Looking at the results obtained, it is seen that the variation in the obtained side surface roughness is not significant to changes in the Linear Energy Density (LED) as the layer thickness was kept constant, with only slight reductions in hardness seen. The annealing process resulted in a significant reduction in hardness. This work has shown that through the careful tailoring of processing conditions, multi-functionality within one part can be integrated and has created promising avenues for further research into achieving fully functionally graded structures.},

ABSTRACT = {The poor wear resistance of 316L stainless steel restricts further practical application. In this study, to improve its microhardness and wear resistance, the TiC and NbC ceramic particles were introduced to 316L powder fabricate (Ti, Nb)C ceramics-reinforced composite coatings by laser cladding. The effects of ceramics addition on the phase composition, microstructure, microhardness, and wear properties of the composite coating were investigated with an X-ray diffractometer, optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, a Vickers hardness tester, and a multi-functional surface performance tester. Results indicate that the TiC and NbC ceramic particles were distributed at the grain boundaries, effectively inhibiting the grain growth and refining the microstructure. The addition of ceramic particles could have decreased the temperature gradient and promoted the transformation from columnar crystals to equiaxed crystals. In addition, the microhardness was improved due to fine grain strengthening and solid solution strengthening. The friction coefficient and cross-sectional area of the composite coating were 0.381 and 8164.732 μm2, which was 0.846 and 0.603 times that of the 316L coating, respectively. Moreover, severe adhesive wear and plastic deformation was transformed into slight adhesive wear and abrasive wear due to the addition of TiC and NbC particles. This study provides new approaches to improving the wear resistance of 316L stainless steel and broadens its application.},

ABSTRACT = {Fused filament fabrication (FFF) 3D printing technology for continuous fiber-reinforced composite (CFRC) printing has become a trend. This article is based on ‘independent extrusion’ FFF CFRC printing. The continuous fiber-reinforced filament (CFRF) printing solution is the contour offset method for obtaining executable g-code. When the CFRCF prints at the corner, it is found that the actual CFRC printing trajectory is inconsistent with the ideal laying trajectory. The causes of the error are analyzed, and an angle optimization algorithm is proposed. The corner optimization algorithm is verified by theoretical analysis and experimental analysis. From the experimental results, the corner optimization algorithm improves the 30° angle fit of CFRF printing by 90% and reliability has also been improved. When the printing length is 127,200 mm, there are 960 printing corners, and the failure rate is 0.},

In addition, thermal, mechanical, and rheological characterization were performed on the wax filament, revealing several important findings. For instance, the rheological studies identified the low viscosity of melted wax at printing temperatures. This resulted in the rough surface of the printed parts. To improve the surface roughness, a post-processing procedure was implemented using a white spirit as a surface smoothing agent.},

ABSTRACT = {The current limitations of design for additive manufacturing (DfAM) are the state of knowledge on materials and the effects of production parameters. As more engineering-grade polymers become available for fused filament fabrication (FFF), the designs and processes must be adapted to fully utilize the structural properties of such materials. By studying and comparing the production parameters of a material test specimen and a component, the effects of layer temperature on the strength, surface roughness, and dimensional accuracy of PA6-CF were found. As the cross-section increases in component manufacturing, maintaining the layer temperature becomes a major challenge. From the findings, the concept of thermal layer design (TLD) was introduced as a way of increasing strength via temperature in selected regions after presenting the effect of layer temperature. TLD proved to have a major effect on layer temperature and heat distribution. Depending on the investigated layer temperature, from 147 °C to 193 °C the UTS of PA6-CF increased from 42 MPa to 73 MPa. Implementing TLD in DfAM represents a big leap for designing high-performance polymer components.},

ABSTRACT = {Current production systems that respond to market demands with high rates of production change and customization use complex systems. These systems are machines with a high capacity for communication, sensing and self-diagnosis, although they are susceptible to failures, breakdowns and a loss of reliability. The amount of data they provide as a productive system and, individually, as a machine can be treated to improve customized maintenance plans. The objective of this work, with an operational scope, is to collect and exploit the knowledge acquired in the industrial plant on failures and breakdowns based on its historical data. The acquisition of the aforementioned data is channeled through the human intellectual capital of the work groups formed for this purpose. Once this knowledge is acquired and available in a worksheet format according to the Reliability-Centered Maintenance (RCM) methodology, it is implemented using Case-Based Reasoning algorithms in a Java application developed for this purpose to carry out the process of RCM, accessing a base of similar cases that can be adapted. This operational definition allows for the control of the maintenance function of an industrial plant in the short term, with a weekly horizon, to design a maintenance plan adjusted to the reality of the plant in its current operating context, which may differ greatly from the originally projected plan or from any other plan caused by new production requirements. This new plan designed as such will apply changes to the equipment, which make up the production system, as a consequence of the adaptation to the changing market demand. As a result, a computer application has been designed, implemented and validated that allows, through the incorporation of RCM cases already successfully carried out on the productive system of the plant, for the development of a customized maintenance plan through an assistant, which, in a conductive way, guides the plant maintenance engineer through their design process, minimizing human error and design time and leveraging existing intellectual capital.},

ABSTRACT = {Residual stress often has a significant impact on part performance and lifetime. Existing measurement techniques using strain gauges or non-destructive methods are often expensive and time-consuming. This paper presents a low-cost, novel measurement device that uses digital image correlation with the hole-drilling method to quantify the magnitude and preferred orientation of these locked-in forces. A two-axis measurement device that rapidly drills and images the surface around the hole was developed to measure residual stresses as a function of depth with sub-millimetre resolution. Validation of the device and DIC methodology was performed using a four-point bending specimen and comparison with conventional strain gauge methods. The results showed strong correlations between the two measurement techniques, as well as the theoretical estimates. The total cost of production was estimated to be approximately £380, which is significantly cheaper than competitors. The device also substantially reduced the cost per measurement point (less than £1 vs. £50+) and shortened the experiment duration from 2 h per point to 45 min per measurement. A functional, rapid, economical device has been designed and produced, which is currently being used for residual stress analysis of industrial samples. The presented design is completely open-source, and the relevant links are provided.},

ABSTRACT = {Machine learning (ML) is one of the artificial intelligence tools which uses past data to learn the relationship between input and output and helps to predict future trends. Powder bed fusion additive manufacturing (PBF-AM) is extensively used for a wide range of applications in the industry. The AM process establishment for new material is a crucial task with trial-and-error approaches. In this work, ML techniques have been applied for the prediction of the density of PBF-AM. Density is the most vital property in evaluating the overall quality of the AM building part. The ML techniques, namely, artificial neural network (ANN), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), and linear regression (LR), are used to develop a model for predicting the density of the stainless steel (SS) 316L build part. These four methods are validated using R-squared values and different error functions to compare the predicted result. The ANN and SVM model performed well with the R-square value of 0.95 and 0.923, respectively, for the density prediction. The ML models would be beneficial for the prediction of the process parameters. Further, the developed ML model would also be helpful for the future application of ML in additive manufacturing.},

The experimental results show that the porous printing platform can enhance the adhesion between the initial forming layer and the printing platform and improve the demolding efficiency of the forming device. In addition, the pull-out design of the printing platform plate reduces the maintenance cost of the forming device. Therefore, the device has a good application prospect.},

ABSTRACT = {Data availability is changing the way companies make decisions at various levels (e.g., strategical and operational). Researchers and practitioners are exploring how product–service system (PSS) providers can benefit from data availability and usage, especially when it comes to making decisions related to service delivery. One of the services that are expected to benefit most from data availability is maintenance. Through the analysis of the asset health status, service providers can make informed and timely decisions to prevent failures. Despite this, the offering of data-based maintenance service is not trivial, and requires providers to structure themselves to collect, analyze and use historical and real-time data properly (e.g., introducing suitable information flows, methods and competencies). The paper aims to investigate how a manufacturing company can re-engineer its maintenance service delivery process in a data-driven fashion. Thus, the paper presents a case study where, based on the Dual-perspective, Data-based, Decision-making process for Maintenance service delivery (D3M), an Italian manufacturing company reengineered its maintenance service delivery process in a data-driven fashion. The case study highlights the benefits and barriers coming with this transformation and aims at helping manufacturing companies in understanding how to address it.},

ABSTRACT = {In order to cope with the changing era of the innovative management paradigm of the manufacturing industry, it is necessary to advance the construction of smart factories in the domestic manufacturing industry, and in particular, the 3D design and manufacturing content sector is highly growthable. In particular, the core technologies that enable digital transformation VR (Virtual Reality)/AR (Augmented Reality) technologies have developed rapidly in recent years, but have not yet achieved any particular results in industrial engineering. In the manufacturing industry, digital threads and collaboration systems are needed to reduce design costs that change over and over again due to the inability to respond to various problems and demands that should be considered when designing products. To this end, we propose a VR/AR collaboration model that increases efficiency of manufacturing environments such as inspection and maintenance as well as design simultaneously with participants through 3D rendering virtualization of facilities or robot 3D designs in VR/AR. We implemented converting programs and middleware CPS (Cyber Physical System) servers that convert to BOM (Bill of Material)-based 3D graphics models and CPS models to test the accuracy of data and optimization of 3D modeling and study their performance through robotic arms in real factories.},

ABSTRACT = {As three-dimensional (3D) printing technology is widely used, security issues have arisen, especially in the terminal parts of automobiles, aircraft, and 3D-printed military equipment. If the original design models or the STL (stereolithography) files are hacked or tampered, severe consequences can be anticipated. In this paper, we propose a demonstration to use a high-throughput blockchain to store the “fingerprints” of the 3D model and verify the “fingerprints” before printing to prevent illegal tampering. Relying on the tamper-resistant features of blockchain, the security of the model and the credibility of the terminal components can be ensured. The combination of blockchain and 3D printing will help people to build a trusted manufacturing environment and realize a more flexible manufacturing for future industry.},

ABSTRACT = {Industry 4.0 is fast becoming a mainstream goal, and many companies are lining up to join the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Small and medium-sized enterprises, especially in the manufacturing industry, are the most heavily challenged in adopting new technology. One of the reasons why these enterprises are lagging behind is the motivation of the key personnel, the decision-makers. The factories in question often do not have a pressing need for advancing to Industry 4.0 and are wary of the risk in doing so. The authors present a rapid, low-cost prototyping solution for the manufacturing companies with legacy machinery intending to adopt the Industry 4.0 paradigm with a low-risk initial step. The legacy machines are retrofitted through the Industrial Internet of Things, making these machines both connectable and capable of providing data, thus enabling process monitoring. The machine chosen as the digitization target was not connectable, and the retrofit was extensive. The choice was made to present the benefits of digitization to the stakeholders quickly and effectively. Indeed, the solution provides immediate results within manufacturing industrial settings, with the ultimate goal being the digital transformation of the entire factory. This work presents an implementation cycle for digitizing an industrial broaching machine, supported by state-of-the-art literature analysis. The methodology utilized in this work is based on the well-known DMAIC strategy customized for the specifics of this case study.},

ABSTRACT = {An existing challenge in the use of continuous fiber reinforcements in additively manufactured parts is the limited availability of suitable fiber materials. This leads to a reduced adaptability of the mechanical properties to the load case. The increased design freedom of additive manufacturing allows the flexible deposition of fiber strands at defined positions, so that even different fiber materials can be easily combined in a printed part. In this work, therefore, an approach is taken to combine carbon and aramid fibers in printed composite parts to investigate their effects on mechanical properties. For this purpose, tensile, flexural and impact tests were performed on printed composite parts made of carbon and aramid fibers in a nylon matrix with five different mixing ratios. The tests showed that the use of hybrid composites for additive manufacturing is a reasonable approach to adapt the mechanical properties to the loading case at hand. The experiments showed that increasing the aramid fiber content resulted in an increase in impact strength, but a decrease in tensile and flexural strength and a decrease in stiffness. Microstructural investigations of the fracture surfaces showed that debonding and delamination were the main failure mechanisms. Finally, Rule of Hybrid Mixture equations were applied to predict the mechanical properties at different mixture ratios. This resulted in predicted values that differed from the experimentally determined values by an average of 5.6%.},

ABSTRACT = {Defects are a leading issue for the rejection of parts manufactured through the Directed Energy Deposition (DED) Additive Manufacturing (AM) process. In an attempt to illuminate and advance in situ quality monitoring and control of workpieces, we present an innovative data-driven method that synchronously collects sensing data and AM process parameters with a low sampling rate during the DED process. The proposed data-driven technique determines the important influences that individual printing parameters and sensing features have on prediction at the inter-layer qualification to perform feature selection. Three Machine Learning (ML) algorithms including Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) are used. During post-production, a threshold is applied to detect low-density occurrences such as porosity sizes and quantities from CT scans that render individual layers acceptable or unacceptable. This information is fed to the ML models for training. Training/testing are completed offline on samples deemed “high-quality” and “low-quality”, utilizing only features recorded from the build process. CNN results show that the classification of acceptable/unacceptable layers can reach between 90% accuracy while training/testing on a “high-quality” sample and dip to 65% accuracy when trained/tested on “low-quality”/“high-quality” (respectively), indicating over-fitting but showing CNN as a promising inter-layer classifier.},

ABSTRACT = {The recent development of RepRap style 3D printers has made additive manufacturing technology available to the public at a low cost. While these 3D printers are being used for a variety of purposes, one of the main applications is prototyping in design projects. The quality of the 3D-printed parts has been a concern in such cases. Many variables within these printers’ operation can be varied to obtain optimum print quality. This study explores a setup that uses externally induced mechanical vibrations to the nozzle tip as a potential method to improve the quality of 3D-printed parts. Induced vibration is expected to decrease the porosity of printed parts and enhance the cohesion between print beads, ultimately improving their mechanical properties. The objective is to understand the prints’ positional accuracy, porosity, and mechanical properties with the added vibration and then to determine the optimum vibration level to achieve the best quality prints. While previous studies have explored the role of induced vibration on the mechanical properties of printed parts, the novelty of this work lies in the determination of the positional accuracy of those parts and the determination of optimum vibration levels to achieve desired properties. For positional accuracy, the extruder filament is replaced with a pointed-tip pen that can mark the exact location where the printer delivers the material. A comparison between the locations marked by the pen with and without vibrations shows that the errors induced by the added vibration are not significantly different from those caused by the uncertainties of the printer itself. Based on the tensile tests of the printed specimens, it is concluded that the parts printed with induced vibrations have improved mechanical properties. The printed parts’ porosity is reduced significantly due to the induced vibrations. Further, this study also explores the optimum motor speeds to achieve a uniform distribution of material. It determines medium motor speeds that provide a maximum vibration amplitude, which is more desirable for a consistent infill.},

ABSTRACT = {The methanation process is discussed as one way to chemically store renewable energy in a future energy system. An important criterion for its application is the availability of compact, low-cost reactor concepts with high conversion rates for decentralized use where the renewable energy is produced. Current research focuses on the maximization of the methane yield through improved temperature control of the exothermic reaction, which attempts to avoid both kinetic and thermodynamic limitations. In this context, traditional manufacturing methods limit the design options of the reactor and thus the temperature control possibilities. The use of additive manufacturing methods removes this restriction and creates new freedom in the design process. This paper formulates the requirements for a novel methanation reactor and presents their implementation to a highly innovative reactor concept called ‘ADDmeth’. By using a conical reaction channel expanding from Ø 8 to 32 mm, three twisted, expanding heat pipes (Ø 8 mm in evaporation zone, Ø 12 mm in condenser zone) and a lattice structure for feed gas preheating and mechanical stabilization of the reactor, the design explicitly exploits the advantages of additive manufacturing. The reactor is very compact with a specific mass of 0.36 kg/kW and has a high share of functional volume of 52%. The reactor development was accompanied by tensile tests of additively manufactured samples with the used material 1.4404 (316 L), strength calculations for stability verification and feasibility studies on the printability of fine structures. Ultimate tensile strengths of up to 750 N/mm2 (at room temperature) and sufficiently high safety factors of the pressure-loaded structures against yielding were determined. Finally, the paper presents the manufactured bench-scale reactor ADDmeth1 and its implementation.},

ABSTRACT = {Printed electronics are a set of additive manufacturing methods for creating future flexible electronics on thin polymeric sheets. We proposed the toner-type, dry, page-printing of Ag–Ni composite conductive particles on flexible plastic sheets without pre-treatment. No chemical solvents are necessary to compose the inks of the electronic materials used for the toner-type printing, and no chemical treatment is required for the plastic film substrate surface. In addition, multilayer printing is simple when using toner printing because previously printed materials do not need to be resolved; furthermore, composing the thick films of the electronic materials is relatively simple. In this study, we fabricated an Ag–Ni composite toner to improve the fluidity of the toner particles compared to bare Ag particles. We successfully printed IC peripheral circuits at a resolution of 0.20 mm and demonstrated that the actual electrical circuit pattern can be formed using our method.},

ABSTRACT = {Three-dimensional printing technology has the advantage of facilitating the construction of complex three-dimensional shapes. For this reason, it is widely used in medical and radiological fields. However, few materials with high electron density similar to that of bone exist for fabricating a human phantom. In this study, commercially available filament materials were used with an FDM 3D printer to perform delivery quality assurance (DQA) and were evaluated for medical use. For the bone filament material, BaSO4 was synthesized in five ratios of 2%, 4%, 6%, 8%, and 10% with 40% PBAT and 50~58% PLA. The electron density for the 3D printing material fabricated was obtained using kV energy CT and compared with the electron density of human organs and bones. The radiation beam properties of the 3D printed structures were analyzed as films for treatment using a linear accelerator. As a result, by changing the infill density of the material, it was possible to produce a material similar to the density of human organs, and a homogeneous bone material with HU values ranging from 371 ± 9 to 1013 ± 28 was produced. The 3D printing material developed in this study is expected to be usefully applied to the development of a patient-specific phantom to evaluate the accuracy of radiotherapy.},

ABSTRACT = {Additive manufacturing (AM) of metallic materials is increasingly being adopted in numerous sectors, such as biomedicine, aerospace or automotive industries, due to its versatility in the creation of complex geometries and the minimisation of material waste when compared to traditional subtractive methods. In order to ensure a reliable operation of these parts, however, an in-depth study of the effect of additive manufacturing on mechanical properties, including tensile, fatigue and fracture resistance, is necessary. Among the vast number of methods and materials, this project is focused in one of the most promising techniques for the industry: Selective Laser Melting (SLM) for the production of a tools steel, in particular C300 steel components for the automotive sector. The main objective of this paper is to optimise some of the key parameters in the printing process, such as laser power, laser speed and hatch spacing. These variables are essential to obtain parts with good resistance. To that purpose, tensile tests were performed in 3D printed specimens, and then elastoplastic properties were extracted, organised and analysed through a design of experiments for the subsequent output fitting using the response surface methodology.},

ABSTRACT = {For the problem of high waste heat in the active area of high-power VCSEL arrays and the difficulty of heat dissipation, we took advantage of laser 3D printing technology and combined it with the relevant principles of fluid-structure coupling, three kinds of microchannel heat sink with different structures of pin-fin, honeycomb, and double-layer reflow were designed. The heat dissipation capacity of three kinds of heat sinks to the heat flux density 200 W/cm2 VCSEL array and the influence of the key characteristics of the microchannel on the heat dissipation capacity was studied. The results show that the double-layer reflow microchannel heat sink has the strongest heat dissipation capability, with the minimum thermal resistance value of 0.258 °C/W when the microchannel diameter and the cooling mass flow rate were 0.5 mm and 24 L/h, respectively. The inner wall roughness of the pure copper microchannel prepared by 3D printing technology was 7.08 μm, and the heat sink thermal resistance was reduced by 0.7% compared with the smooth channel wall. The deviation of the microchannel diameter from the design size (500 μm) was −10 μm, and the heat sink thermal resistance was reduced by 0.8% compared to the theoretical value, which shows that the surface roughness and size deviation of the 3D printed microchannel had beneficial effect on enhancing heat dissipation. The actual thermal conductivity of the 3D printed pure copper after heat treatment was 310.4 W/m-K, at which point the thermal resistance was 0.306 °C/W, and the maximum temperature was 35.3 °C, which satisfied the operating temperature range of the chip. This study provides a theoretical basis and implementation method for the fabrication of heat sinks for high-energy VCSEL arrays using laser 3D printing technology.},

ABSTRACT = {To increase the surface quality of the high-strength maraging steel metal materials, a new method of executing the additive manufacturing process and subtraction polishing process of maraging steel metal materials was studied. The mechanical properties of maraging steel metal materials before and after laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) polishing were compared and analyzed. The influence of laser parameters on the formability of high-strength MS metal materials was studied, with MS additive parts successfully prepared. The initial surfaces had roughness values of 6.198–7.92 μm. The metal additive manufacturing parts were polished with double laser beams. Confocal microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and X-ray diffraction were used to obtain the microstructure and phase composition of the microstructures. The microhardness of high-strength maraging forming parts by using a microhardness tester and the mechanical properties were analyzed. The results showed that the surface roughness was considerably reduced to lengthen the service life of the high-strength MS metal materials from an initial roughness of Sa = 6.3 μm to Sa = 0.98 μm, with the surface hardness increased and the martensite content decreased after using double-laser-beam polishing.},

ABSTRACT = {The development of injection molding tools is an expensive, time-consuming, and resource-intensive process offering little to no flexibility to adapt to variations in product design. Metal additive manufacturing can be used to produce these tools in a cost-effective way. Nevertheless, in an industrial context, effective methods are missing for the selection of the most suitable technology for the given tooling project. This paper presents a method to compare process chains based on additive and conventional subtractive technologies for the manufacturing of metal tooling for injection molding. The comparison is based on a technology focused-performance analysis (TFPA) through computer simulation performed using Tecnomatix Plant Simulation developed by Siemens Digital Industries Software combined with a customized cost–benefit economic analysis tool. The analysis of the technology comparison highlights potential bottlenecks for production, such as the printing phase and the heat treatment. It also gives a deeper understanding of the technology maturity level of conventional milling machines against laser powder bed fusion machines. The result is that the total costs for an insert made by AM and CM are indeed rather similar (the cost difference between the two tooling process chains is lower than 5%). The cost analysis reveals major costs drivers in the production of high-performance molding tools, such as the cutting tools employed for the milling steps and their changeover frequency. The industrial case of a 32-cavity mold insert for plastic injection molding is used to perform the study, develop the analysis, and validate the results.},

ABSTRACT = {In the industrial domain, maintenance is essential to guarantee the correct operations, availability, and efficiency of machinery and systems. With the advent of Industry 4.0, solutions based on machine learning can be used for the prediction of future failures by exploiting historical failure data. Most of the time, these historical data have been collected by companies without a specific structure, schema, or even best practices, resulting in a potential loss of knowledge. In this paper, we analyze the historical data on maintenance alerts of the components of a revamping topping plant (referred to as RT2) belonging to the SARAS group. This analysis is done in collaboration with the ITALTELECO company, a partner of SARAS, that provided the necessary data. The pre-processing methodology to clean and fill these data and extract features useful for a prediction task will be shown. More in detail, we show the process to fill missing fields of these data to provide (i) a category for each fault by using simple natural language processing techniques and performing a clustering, and (ii) a data structure that can enable machine learning models and statistical approaches to perform reliable failure predictions. The data domain in which this methodology is applied is oil and gas, but it may be generalized and reformulated in various industrial and/or academic fields. The ultimate goal of our work is to obtain a procedure that is simple and can be applied to provide strategic support for the definition of an adequate maintenance plan.},

ABSTRACT = {In this work, blends that were based on first use PP added with talc (PPt) and recycled polypropylene (r-PP) were designed and formulated, aiming at producing filaments that are suitable for 3D printing fused filament fabrication (FFF) processes. A preliminary characterization of PPt/r-PP blends at different weight ratios allowed selecting two systems showing adequate rheological behavior for FFF. The selected blends were melt compounded in a twin-screw extruder, optimizing the processing conditions through a design of experiments approach, involving the use of Taguchi’s method. The materials that were prepared with the optimized processing conditions, hence showing the best performance in terms of rheological behavior and thermal characteristics, were then selected for the production of the filament and for the subsequent FFF processing. Finally, the morphology of the filament and the mechanical properties of 3D-printed samples were assessed, demonstrating the achievement of satisfactory results in terms of performances. In general, the obtained results clearly demonstrated that a proper optimization of both material and processing conditions offers the possibility of using recycled PP-based formulations for additive manufacturing processes, hence allowing a remarkable valorization of a low added-value material through its utilization for an innovative and sustainable manufacturing approach.},

ABSTRACT = {In this work, a simple, easy to use MATLAB code is presented for the optimal design of materials for 3D domains. For the optimal design of materials, the theoretical framework of topology optimization and that of homogenization were utilized to develop a formulation where the design of the micro-structure of the material is affected among others by the loading and boundary conditions of the 3D macro domain. The final result of the micro-scale can then be converted into an stl file, which can be utilized for 3D printing; however, the continuity of the unit cells when assembled to form the macro structure should be taken into account. The transition of the design of the material problem formulation from 2D to 3D domains generates drastically increased computational needs in order to perform the design procedures, which might narrow its formulation scales and the corresponding sizes of the adopted finite element discretization. Thus, in addition to the optimal design of materials implementation, the utilization of three different model order reduction (MOR) approaches is presented, aiming to assist towards the reduction of the computational cost of the two scales formulation. On-the-fly reduced order model, proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), and approximate reanalysis (AR) following the combined approximations are the three approaches adopted for the purposes of this study, while the code implementation enables the addition of new ones easily.},

ABSTRACT = {The middle ear bones (‘ossicles’) may become severely damaged due to accidents or to diseases. In these situations, the most common current treatments include replacing them with cadaver-derived ossicles, using a metal (usually titanium) prosthesis, or introducing bridges made of biocompatible ceramics. Neither of these solutions is ideal, due to the difficulty in finding or producing shape-matching replacements. However, the advent of additive manufacturing applications to biomedical problems has created the possibility of 3D-printing anatomically correct, shape- and size-personalized ossicle prostheses. To demonstrate this concept, we generated and printed several models of ossicles, as solid, porous, or soft material structures. These models were first printed with a plottable calcium phosphate/hydroxyapatite paste by extrusion on a solid support or embedded in a Carbopol hydrogel bath, followed by temperature-induced hardening. We then also printed an ossicle model with this ceramic in a porous format, followed by loading and crosslinking an alginate hydrogel within the pores, which was validated by microCT imaging. Finally, ossicle models were printed using alginate as well as a cell-containing nanocellulose-based bioink, within the supporting hydrogel bath. In selected cases, the devised workflow and the printouts were tested for repeatability. In conclusion, we demonstrate that moving beyond simplistic geometric bridges to anatomically realistic constructs is possible by 3D printing with various biocompatible materials and hydrogels, thus opening the way towards the in vitro generation of personalized middle ear prostheses for implantation.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, the deposition layer calculation model is proposed for laser-directed energy deposition (DED) with coaxial powder feeding by combining the powder feeding equation with the volume of fluid (VOF) method, and the single-channel IN718 forming process is simulated in real-time with moving boundary conditions in a fixed coordinate system and experimentally validated. Under single-layer single-channel deposition processing, the deposition height and width decreased by 57.1% and 21.6%, respectively, as the scanning speed increased from 8 mm/s to 14 mm/s. The calculated deposition height, width, and melt pool depth were in good agreement with the experimental results. Calculating the temperature field distribution of the single-layer double-channel deposition at an overlapping-rate of 30% yielded the temperature fluctuation pattern of the deposition at various lap moments. Under the influence of the thermal accumulation of the first deposition channel, the latent heat effect of the melt pool will cause the maximum surface temperature during overlap processing to be slightly lower than the maximum surface temperature during single channel processing; at the same time, under the influence of the high-temperature state of the overlap deposition channel during the scanning process, the first deposition channel will exhibit rewarming during the overlap scanning process. The deposition layer and temperature field of single-layer multi-channel laser deposition are modelled using this information. It has been proved that the model may be used to forecast deposition and temperature fields for intricate processing procedures. The study findings are significant for understanding the process mechanism of coaxial powder feeding laser-directed energy deposition in detail and optimizing the process.},

ABSTRACT = {The development of process parameters for electron beam powder bed fusion (PBF-EB) is usually made with simple geometries and uniform scan lengths. The transfer to complex parts with various scan lengths can be achieved by adapting beam parameters such as beam power and scan speed. Under ideal conditions, this adaption results in a constant energy input into the powder bed despite of the local scan length. However, numerous PBF-EB machines show deviations from the ideal situation because the beam diameter is subject to significant changes if the beam power is changed. This study aims to demonstrate typical scaling issues when applying process parameters to scan lengths up to 45 mm using a fourth generation γ-TiAl alloy. Line energy, area energy, return time, and lateral velocity are kept constant during the additive manufacturing process by adjusting beam power and beam velocity to various scan lengths. Samples produced in this way are examined by light microscopy regarding lateral melt pool extension, melt pool depth, porosity, and microstructure. The process-induced aluminum evaporation is measured by electron probe microanalysis. The experiments reveal undesired changes in melt pool geometry, gas porosity, and aluminum evaporation by increasing the beam power. In detail, beam widening is identified as the reason for the change in melt pool dimensions and microstructure. This finding is supported by numerical calculations from a semi-analytic heat conduction model. This study demonstrates that in-depth knowledge of the electron beam diameter is required to thoroughly control the PBF-EB process, especially when scaling process parameters from simply shaped geometries to complex parts with various scan lengths.},

ABSTRACT = {A display window or store window is the shop’s window that is designed to display items for sale to attract the customers to the stores. Window dressing that depends on visual merchandising is done to make a better impression and implies something dishonest. Knowing the customer from inside and outside through demographic data like ages, psychographics, lifestyles, and behaviors is the main factor that must be kept in display window designer’s mind. The designer takes display colors, light, and signage in consideration. In the presented paper, factors of designing display windows that affect increasing customer attraction and buying rate are studied. An analysis of this variable is established to select which of them have good effects. Optimizing customers’ attraction and buying rate values is carried out by controlling the selected affected variables through a designed and implemented fuzzy logic control system as an artificial intelligence tool. The fuzzy system, used for optimizing the number of viewers for stores’ display windows by controlling the affected factors, is a new approach used in the display window design field.},

ABSTRACT = {Material extrusion (ME) using a filament including metal powders has recently attracted considerable attention because it allows the production of metal parts at low cost. However, like other additive manufacturing processes, metal ME suffers from the problem of internal pores. In this study, warm isostatic pressure (WIP)—a post-process used to downsize or remove the pores in polymer ME—was employed in metal ME to improve the mechanical properties of the finished part. It was confirmed experimentally that the tensile strength and the strain at the ultimate tensile strength were increased by WIP. However, from hardness tests, two different results were obtained. On a microscopic scale, there was no change in hardness because the temperature of the WIP process was not high enough to change the microstructure, while on a macroscopic scale, the hardness changed owing to the collapse of the pores within the material under the indenter load. In specimens with relatively large pores, the hardness sensitivity increases with a larger indenter. Finally, factors affecting the WIP process parameters in metal ME were discussed.},

ABSTRACT = {Rapid tooling is a methodology which aims to integrate additive manufacturing into the production of tools to be used in casting, forming or machining processes. In forming, rapid tooling is applied in the production of metallic or plastic tools that guarantee good performance in small- and medium-sized batch production. However, most punches tested to date have dimensions measured in millimeters and are therefore unsuitable for typical real-world industrial processes. In this study, the performance of plastic punches with geometries designed for industrial application was investigated. A deep drawing process involving AISI 304 blanks was created for the manufacturing of cups. Experimental and numerical analyses were conducted to measure the quality of the cups produced and the behaviour of the punches involved. The results indicate that when punch dimensions increase, a more precise cup geometry is produced (99% of drawing depth, 98% of cup precision on the fillet radius, and roundness error equal to 0.53%).},

ABSTRACT = {This paper proposes a gel-formed abrasive tool to address the problem of abrasive agglomeration in a traditional hot-pressing abrasive tool. The effect of Polyimide resin content on the mechanical properties of the gel abrasive tools were tested, and a comparison of the mechanical properties of the gel abrasive tool and the hot-pressing tool was conducted. An orthogonal experiment was conducted to explore the best combination of machining parameters. A polishing experiment of sapphire was conducted to compare the processing effect of the gel abrasive tool and hot-pressing tool. The results from testing the mechanical properties showed that the tensile, flexural, and impact strength of the gel abrasive tool was better than that of the hot-pressing abrasive tool. The results of the orthogonal experiment showed that the best process parameters of the gel abrasive tool were a spindle speed of 900 rpm, a feed rate of 8 μm/min, and a grinding depth of 16 μm. The polishing experiment showed that the gel abrasive tool had a better processing effect on sapphire. The sapphire surface processed by the gel abrasive tool had no deep scratches, and an ultrasmooth surface could be obtained after chemical mechanical polishing (CMP).},

ABSTRACT = {Additive manufacturing technologies have been in continuous growth due to their advantages over traditional manufacturing. The iro3d is a powder deposition machine designed to build metal parts. This research work proposed the adaptation of the iro3d selective powder deposition process to allow the production of glass-ceramic parts using recycled glass powders. Various specimens were produced using different deposition strategies such as build orientation and sintering holding times. Specimens were evaluated in terms of geometric distortions (shrinking and warping) and in terms of mechanical performance (flexural behavior and hardness). Two geometrically complex test parts were also produced to infer the minimum feature size capabilities of the process. The results denoted parts that displayed significant geometrical deviations, which could be correlated with some of the tested parameters. Through the addition of sand to the tested specimens, we demonstrated that distortions could be mitigated with proper control of the powder’s coalescence. In the end, the specimens’ fracture surfaces were examined, and the presence of porosities was correlated with their mechanical properties. The results demonstrated that the iro3d SPD process could be used to produce additively manufactured glass parts.},

ABSTRACT = {Due to the augmented complexity of the factory on the one hand and the increased availability of information on the other hand, nowadays it is possible to design models of production lines able to consider the state of the health of the production system. Such models must combine both the deterministic and the stochastic behaviours of a system, with the former accounting for the mechanics and physics of the industrial process and the latter for randomness, including reliability of the production systems and the unpredictability of the maintenance and of the manufacturing lines. This study proposes the application of a Hybrid Dependability Modelling based on Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the performances of a repairable production line modelled with a queueing G/G/1 system. The model proposed is characterized by random interarrival and service times and by the wearing and dynamic aging phenomena of the machine tools that depend on the working and operating conditions.},

ABSTRACT = {This study considers the problem of numerical modeling of the PEEK product’s 3D printing using the FDM technology. The aim of the study is to verify the adequacy of the use of a thermoviscoelastic model for numerical computations of the PEEK deposition process and to develop an algorithm for calculating this process. The Prony model is used to describe the thermoviscoelastic behavior of the material under study; the temperature-time shift is described by the Williams–Landel–Ferry function (WLF). To obtain the values of the material constants of the relaxation function, first, we used data from other authors; however, after their substitution into the numerical simulation, it was not possible to obtain results close to the full-scale experiment. Therefore, realized our own DMA experiment. The algorithm was developed and implemented in the ANSYS package to calculate non-stationary temperature fields and the stress–strain state of the structure during its layer-by-layer deposition. To solve these problems, the technology of “killing” and subsequent “aliving” of the PEEK material, implemented in the ANSYS package, is used. The numerical algorithm is verified with the results of an experiment on printing samples from PEEK. A good consistency of the calculated data with the experiment is shown.},

ABSTRACT = {This work explores the use of additive manufacturing (AM) to reprocess recycled glass and carbon fibers in the automotive sector. It aims to foster exploitation of recycled Glass Fiber Reinforced Polymers (rGFRPs) and recycled Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymers (rCFRPs) through two manufacturing workflows: indirect Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) and UV-assisted Direct Ink Writing (UV-DIW). An industrial case study on vehicle components has been considered by prototyping one real component. After the tensile tests, some molds were fabricated with a FFF 3D printer for the indirect 3D printing process to cast an epoxy-based thermosetting resin with rGFs and rCFs. The second technology consisted in fabricating the parts by hardening in-situ a photo- and thermal-curable thermosetting acrylic liquid resin with rGFs. These results validate the use of AM and recycled composites for applications in the automotive sector. These approaches may be implemented for customizable components for batches below 100 vehicles as the first step for their exploitation.},

ABSTRACT = {Metal additive manufacturing, particularly laser powder bed fusion, is increasingly used in the gas turbine industry for the fabrication of channels with small diameters for conformal cooling and flow passage applications. A critical challenge in this context lies in evaluating aspects such as the geometrical and hydraulic diameters, the effective area and the roughness on the internal surface of the channel that affects the flow functionality. This paper proposes a new method to evaluate the geometrical and functional equivalent diameters, i.e., the hydraulic diameter of cylindrical channels and the mean surface topography height on the internal channel surface, using X-ray computed tomography. The developed methods were validated with experimental flow tests, considering the mean surface topography height to be equivalent to the hydrodynamic sand grain roughness, thereby determining the hydraulic diameter and the associated effective area. The method is a much faster approach to determining the available hydraulic diameter compared to flow tests and offers the possibility of evaluating the internal surface characteristics, with discrepancies between the two approaches being less than ±3%.},

ABSTRACT = {Colored contact lenses have gained popularity in recent years. However, their production process is plagued by low efficiency, which is attributed to the complex nature of the lens color patterns. The manufacturing process involves multiple complex steps that can introduce defects or inconsistencies into the contact lenses. Moreover, manual inspection of a considerable number of contact lenses that are produced inefficiently in terms of consistency and quality by humans is prevalent. Alternatively, automatic optical inspection (AOI) systems have been developed to perform quality-control checks on colored contact lenses. However, their accuracy is limited due to the increasing complexity of the lens color patterns. To address these issues, convolutional neural networks have been used to detect and classify defects in colored contact lenses. This study aims to provide a comprehensive guide for AOI systems using artificial intelligence in the colored contact lens manufacturing process, including the benefits and challenges of using these systems. Further, future research directions to achieve a classification accuracy of >95%, which is the human recognition rate, are explored.},
